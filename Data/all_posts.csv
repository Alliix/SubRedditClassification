iSlurpees,depression,1620602439.0,Is this depression,"I felt on top of the world Friday night, everything was going for me.
Now I just feel so low and like I’m putting on an act whenever I’m with people.
I let myself get walked all over and don’t care.
I keep asking myself who would care if I didn’t come home.
I drink and don’t stop because it makes me the life of the party for a few hours.
Makes me not feel small for a while. 
But then I go back to being alone and the thoughts start coming back."
Awkward-Cat98,depression,1620642542.0,White hair due to stress and depression,"Hi everyone, 
I really want to hear if anyone has had experiences with white hair due to stress and if it will go away. I am only 23 years old and this year has been extremely stressful for me, and I started to notice a lot of white hair. When I say a lot I don’t mean like 5 hairs, I mean like a LOT. I started to notice small strands that are completely white, and honestly that caused me a lot more stress on top of it. 
I’m hoping Hearing other’s experiences will help me feel a bit better."

sugarpopp,depression,1620507768.0,Am I happy or am I delusional in my bubble?,"I am 25F, gonna turn 26 on 15th May. have been suffering from severe depression, on and off since 2018. Although I thought the extreme dark days and nights are long gone, I believe the wind keeps blowing back via triggers/memories/conversations. Sometimes when I’m calm and happy I start questioning my state- am I really happy? Or am I just comfortable in my delusional bubble? With my birthday coming up, I feel worse. Earlier I used to be so happy on my birthday, now the second birthday amidst a lockdown (I live in India) is scaring me. I am too afraid to even drink on my birthday because I feel I am going to end up crying and emotionally bursting about how I turned 26 amd I have not done anything meaningful in life yet. I don’t know what I want to do, I have a skill with which I am making nothing, I am lazy, scared, I lack determination. My general knowledge is zero, I feel like I have grown up to be an useless human."

21stcenturyschizoidf,depression,1620511475.0,Hungover again,"I (26F) always forget how bad I feel after drinking. Normally I avoid, numb, dissociate from bad feelings (or try to). But today I can’t stop crying, feeing regret over the semester I just failed, feeling aimless useless and broken, even going full idiot and hitting myself a bit when I feel those waves of intense self-hatred. 

I see why alcohol could be something to avoid in the future. It’s hard when it’s so normalized. 
I was definitely a binge drinker as a teen but I’ve grown out of that... but... maybe I just mask it better because I’m “high functioning”... 


I googled already how to get over hangover blues but I don’t think they’re written for the clinically depressed.

Scherzokinn,depression,1620579053.0,I don't feel very good and I just want random strangers to talk to me,"I've been in a depressive state since a year. Sometimes I get suicidal thoughts. My parents do everything they can to help me, I have a loving family and minor problems, but I still feel sad, and knowing that makes it worse for me. I get thoughts that I just would like to suppress, and my narrow obsessions take up all of my time, tires me and people don't care and it makes me feel more suicidal. I already have a psychologist and psychiatrist, but they aren't always there. I just want to discuss and express myself."
sergeantpuppers,depression,1620567165.0,Summer seasonal depression,"Just venting/wondering if anyone is feeling the same at the moment. It started a few weeks ago when Spring started taking hold - the sun is now out seemingly perpetually, and it makes me so annoyed and sad. Hell, the sight of a sunny day through the window will set me off into a horrible mood. I thrive in cold, rainy, and dark days during the spring. It’s like they recharge me, only to be drained by the next sunny day. I’m looking ahead to summer and dreading it...

In the autumn/winter, I feel like the world is alive, I just feels right. In the spring/summer, the world feels upside down and everything is horribly uncomfortable; you can’t choose how comfortable you are, the temperature is just always too damned hot. Always. 

Anyway, I really don’t know how to feel more comfortable in the summer. It’s currently so debilitating"
chloethedoggy,depression,1620641289.0,Everything turns phony when I smoke marijuana,"I have been smoking for about 2 years now (17 male), and I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, which I take meds for. When I first started smoking, before I was on my meds, I would get crazy panic attacks and feel like I was unable to breathe. Now that is fine, but something much worse happens when I get high now. I will seem to focus on things very much and completely break them down and judge them, until I point out all the flaws and phoniness in them. I especially do this to myself and the things I say when I am around other people, trying to have a conversation. I really like certain aspects of being high, but I can only now enjoy it when I am smoking alone in the middle of the night, listening to music or watching like one TV show, because everything else seems phony to me and I can't watch it. I am wondering if anyone can help me better understand this problem, and the possible effects that Wellbutrin and Zoloft may have on smoking and feeling this way. tHANKS."

ang_a1,depression,1620618285.0,COVID and mental health,"

I don’t even know where to start. If you feel like this comment below so I know I’m not alone & we can get through this shit together. 
Okay so where do I even start lmao. I literally treat reddit like my therapist. 
First of all this Covid lockdown is literally killing me mentally. I’ve been just on airplane mode if you know what I mean .. I’m here but everything is autopilot mode. I don’t think of things I’m just day dreaming or not even I literally have nothing in my head lmao it’s just silent and I’m just doing my things. 
I moved to another province a year ago and I have friends but god do I ever feel alone. I always feel alone no mater what where or who I am with. My friends here have their own groups and that’s totally okay with that. But when I’m with them I always feel like I’m talking too much or not saying enough or I am extremely boring and they just want to go home. Because they don’t hangout with me the way their own group does WHICH AGAIN I understand because I’m their new friend and they have been friends for years. 
I feel this emptiness in my chest, I just wanna scream at the world for nothing. I am tired of sitting at home 24/7 and it is so extremely hard to get a job right now and I am so unmotivated to do anything. And trust me I’ve tried doing shit. I’m thinking maybe this is because I’ve had a lot going on last year from 2019-2020 because my best friend had cancer and passed away and I haven really touched into that. I know she’s gone but I have not come to terms with it. I don’t know how. I think I just stored it away and god knows when I can deal with it. I cry and I’m sad sometimes that she’s no longer here but I’m not sure if I have grieved Normally ??  I just had a crying stage stressed stage I couldn’t believe it and I still can’t. Pls don’t tell me it’s unhealthy I know it is but I don’t know how to deal with it. 
Basically I feel empty for no reason sometimes. Last week I had a heard week for some reason just a lot of emotions built up I went for a walk and just started bawling my eyes out and the weird thing is it was so cloudy outside and the sun literally was shining above me it felt like a warm hug from my friend. Anyways I feel weird sad like I’m not even here just autopilot mode."
AmetuerGamr15,depression,1620602403.0,What's the point,"I already know my life isn't going anywhere so what's the point? I'll never find love, I'll never find anything that fulfils me. I want to die but I'm too scared."
NoxFerrarius,depression,1620584012.0,"I don’t really know if I want be cured anymore, but i don’t think I can kill myself","I’ve tried a lot of useless treatments. despite all my attempts I am still not cured, I remain eternally alone and afraid of the world, the future and the universe.  I have spoken with a lot of people about a lot of subjects from all angles and I am still unable to heal myself, to socialize, to find myself a job or to put myself in a relationship.  my country has no laws to help people with depression, it is getting really hard to even have hope and I think I have to stop there.  the worst part is that I don't even think I can kill myself.  It’s a very hard act to do and I’m not even able to go through with such a project.  I guess then I have to go on ""living"" with this disease that is eating my brain.  I don’t think I’m looking for help today, just support."
cyrano4833,depression,1620577083.0,the grenade in my pocket,"I was already ""grown up"" (well, never mind that, nearing 40) when I saw a movie called ""Trust."" That was 1991, I think. Grown up, maybe, but still f\*\*ked up as well, years past my only suicide attempt but seeing my third or fifth psychologist/psychiatrist/counselor/therapist anyway. In the movie, Martin Donovan plays a classic misfit who, among other things, carries a hand grenade in his pocket-- just in case. BTW, it has a happy ending, not one with the grenade exploding. Happy of a sort, I guess.

There are millions of details from my past that have long faded from memory but that movie stuck with me, especially the grenade part. In the following years, I always felt that suicide was my just-in-case grenade. I'd tried it (suicide, not grenades) and ""failed"" due to someone who ""saved"" me by cutting me down from the tree limb.

Flash forward to now, after my eighth or tenth counselor person and a session of TMS where I was pronounced ""cured"" by the experts (did I answer their questions honestly? I think I did; on that morning, I hadn't had any suicidal ideation, was sleeping better (was never really a problem), and forget what the other questions were. They and my insurance company were happy to pronounce me cured, which only took maybe 10 days to evaporate. Getting a bill from the provider for half the cost (low five figures, not including the decimal point) didn't help but they're saying it was just a billing error. Well, I hope so. Who says I have no hope?

But the bottom line is it feels more and more like grenade time. I've worked on myself for so long, trying to improve myself in the ways I've been shown, and I'm tired of trying to improve. I certainly haven't started loving myself-- the concept is absurd for me; something there is inside of me that is so deeply flawed. Well, outside too; I have unfortunate facial features and a hard-to-pronounce name that I've waited too long to change to ""John Smith."" My body is weak, tired, and hurting from too many years of bad posture. Mostly by choice, I have few friends but I suspect they'd drop me like a stone or give me platitudes if I told them more of the truth. 

They can't cure me. I can't cure me. I can't think of a thing i want from today, tomorrow, next week, month, year. I sure as s\*\*t don't want another decade. Just like I check my back pocket to see if my wallet's still there, I check my virtual pocket for the virtual grenade."
srkdpu,depression,1620565461.0,Is betterhelp a good enough service? Other affordable yet reliable services?,"I live abroad in a country where I don't yet speak the language, but I need some options for getting help. I am considering such a service as the waiting times in my case are quite big.

Have you tried any of these? Are they good? Are they reliable or is it a cash grab? I need it probably for long-term-ish; at least some months.

The other option is to look for something online from my home country."
Pabst-Pirate,depression,1620540026.0,Seeking help. Who do I talk to and what needs to be said?,"I’m not trying to gush all of the things in my head here, and I’m not looking for a pity party to make me feel like I’m not alone. But enough is enough. I am just sooo tired and I don’t know what to do. I went to a therapist years ago, and I didn’t know what to say then either. It was 30 minutes of small talk. I don’t think she ever got deeper than the guarded surface; and I didn’t know how to let her in.

I’ve been off work for a covid related respiratory issue since December. I have never felt so alone. In the decade I’ve devoted to my job all of my friends have focused on their families and careers while I’m just here, alone in my home. Nothing seems to matter anymore, nothing interests me and everything is a huge bother. I’ve tried to focus on my house, with little success... I just want to feel ok again. I want to want to do things. I want to talk to people and not feel like I’m burdening them with my presence. I want more than I’ll ever have, and that makes me, for lack of a better term, unbearably sad.

How do you start getting better, when you know you need to talk to someone, but you don’t know how to let someone in or express yourself in a way that’s beneficial to your treatment."
_perpetualparadox,depression,1620511027.0,Anyone feel this?,"My well-intentioned boss could tell I wasn't ok today. We talked alot, she mentioned getting brain scans and proper care.

Then she mentioned something along the lines of gratefulness and how it changes the brain. 

This has to be one of my most despised pieces of advice.

I don't believe people become depressed because they lack gratefulness. I often feel quite grateful. Despite this, I still feel major depressive episodes.

The idea that positivity, manifestation and gratefulness can cure depression feels so fucking delusional to me."

a_lonesome_egg,depression,1620606044.0,"I genuinely don't think there's anything I'm good at anymore, and it's taken everything away from me.","I'm passionate about so many things, art, music, character design, writing...and yet I barely do any of it anymore because I feel so horribly inferior to everyone around me, and the evidence for that being reality just seems to pile up more everyday.

I know I shouldn't focus on being ""good"" at things, or compare my creative passions to other people...but i can't help it anymore and it's killed my drive for everything I'm passionate about because all I see is how awful it is. I don't think I've ever been genuinely proud of anything I've done, because my entire life all I've seen is the flaws. 

I feel like such an utter failure, and it's wearing me down unbearably. I just feel so empty and worthless."
hotcoco-jo16,depression,1620518305.0,Depression in college,"Can anyone relate to me? I’ve never had such unexplainable sadness until this year. I’m so tired of crying every single day. I tried to go to the gym today and I started crying on the treadmill. 

This past year has been so hard and I’m failing to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The struggles I faced are small in comparison to everyone else but they have just built up over the past year and knocked me down. It all started January 2020 with feeling lonely at school, then getting dumped, conversion to all online and strict lockdowns, my older brother having serious mental health issues that led him to come home for treatment, my dog dying, roommate issues, and lack of determination and drive for a future or job. Even the smallest things like an internship rejection has made me felt unworthy and like no one likes me. The worst part is knowing I haven’t felt a sustained sense of happiness since fall 2019, and I don’t know when I’m ever going to be that happy again. 

I have very few friends and I am self conscious of who I am as a person since I’m sad all the time. I wouldn’t want to be around me either."
EurekaSeven333,depression,1620515061.0,I just don't know what to think anymore,"Alright, the reason I'm doing this is because I need advice.

I'm in a very difficult situation with my parents, like strong daily arguing and obviously my physical and mental health are suffering greatly from this. To keep it short, the type of depression where you don't feel anything anymore and suicidal thoughts, but only thoughts. I have no intention to kill myself anytime soon, I just think about it a lot, like how I would do it or how people would react and in general just wishing to die without having to do it myself.

So, what exactly goes on at the moment in my family? I'm a 16 year old boy who lives with his mother and stepfather after she broke up with my father. I still see my father every 2 weeks over the weekend, these are the only times I can truly relax from the life here. Why I need to relax? Because my parents here treat me like fucking shit. I often think about if I really have that much of a bad life, as there are so many kids having worse, but I came to conclusion (after I asked tons of persons for their opinion) that it doesn't matter, because that doesn't changes the fact they treat me bad.

Let me explain how my daily life looks like:
I wake up at 7am in the morning, ofc on Saturdays and Sundays as well, that's what my parents tell me to do. After that I go to school and come back home between 1 and 4 pm, based on which day it is. And that's when it just starts getting ridiculous: Often I can't even put away my school stuff in my room because my mother (stepfather works until around 5pm every day) already wants me to do something. Mostly normal things like vacuuming, the dishwasher, walk with our dog, take the empty bottles and stuff down in the basement, taking the trash outside. Basic house stuff. The problem there is not the work itself, but the mass of it and the fact that she herself doesn't do shit all day. She doesn't work, she never did, so she just casually sits home everyday and watches television and plays on her phone, my little sister is in kindergarten after all. At the point I come home my little sister is already back home though. So that's when she starts playing her game. She doesn't do shit all day, but when I'm back home and have done the basic stuff she should have done while I was in school, I don't have free time for myself, god no. Then I can play with my little sister, after she just sat in front of her own phone until I finished the work I had to do. (She is four years old and as long, maybe even longer on her phone than I am) After she just watched YouTube or whatever, I am the one who should go outside and play with her, because my mother suddenly has to do stuff and can't do it. Like the few things I can't do, like washing clothes or cooking. After she has done that she goes back to her television and I have to continue to play with my sister. Or do some other work in the house. That's basically how it goes until 7pm, every single day. After that I eat dinner. At least sometimes, I'm a more or less picky eater, but not like I don't eat healthy stuff or something like that, I simply almost vomit eating some things like onions. Meaning, if these are inside dinner I simply can't eat it. And guess who doesn't care: My parents. Onions in almost every second damn dinner. I can't even eat it if I feel like I starve. That's why I'm way too skinny, it happens that I don't eat anything for sometimes 3 days straight. And well, then I have a tiny bit of time for myself right before sleeping, I mostly use that to simply check on my friends and social media, nothing more. Ofc if anything bad happens, like a bad mark or I'm pissed because they treat me like shit, it's always the fault of my phone, because I can't do anything but play games on my phone. Seems Legit.

But that doesn't end here, not at all. Ofc weekends are the worst days in week. Because I wake up, work e.g. outside basically until it's getting dark. The whole day.

Oh yeah, I don't know ofc how americans handle like pocket money and all that. But only a few months ago I got 10$ for a whole month, nothing more. And if I wanted something I had to buy it myself. That's basically a single time eating fast food with my friends and my money for the whole month is gone.

The worst thing about my parents here is their character in the end. Because, how can I put this as simple and friendly as possible.. They are the most ignorant, stupid, racist, egoistic, fucking worst people on this planet.

For example, every time I say that they do something wrong, or if I get louder in an argument with them because I can't take it anymore. It's always ""respect"". They see respect as something they have the right to get only because they are my parents. And, in their eyes, respect is basically slavery. Meaning, I don't have respect for them if I:
1.Don't do willingly everything they say, every time they say
2.Run while doing everything, because I'm just a lazy ass, I have to almost run doing stuff because I'm ""too slow""
3.Accept that they are ALWAYS in the right. No matter what, I have to accept what they say, if I even argue I get told I have no respect and I automatically lose. Meaning I can't even change things, as there's only one right opinion for them, which is their own. Everyone else is wrong. Seems Legit again.

I've tried reaching them several times, friendly, unfriendly, alone, with a friend, with a therapist, through talking, through writing a letter. I tried everything. Not that they would care about any of that. Because everything they do is right.

I'm at a point where I just can't take things anymore. I use every bit of time I have between two tasks to sneek in my room and just sit on my bed. When someone asks what I'm doing again instead of working I say ""nothing"".

For them, nothing equals looking at my phone of course. But if I say ""nothing"", I mean looking at my wall, thinking about death, thinking about why I deserved this, thinking about if really they are wrong or if I'm just a fucking wimp who can't do anything, if I'm the problem. Then, once again, I asked a lot of people if it's right what my parents do. Random strangers, my dearest friends, some distant family and my real father, online question portals. Every single person I asked said what they do is wrong. They all pity me, living under these conditions for 16 years now. Never having much money, or expensive clothing. Not because we can't afford it, but because obviously I'm not worth it. My 19 year old sister always got anything she wanted, to a point where she got 300$ shoes every two weeks. And goes who paid 30 dollar himself for some no name shoes lmao

The reason for this post is seeking for advice and help. I want, I need opinions of people I never met before. People who can analyze my parents and tell me if they are in the right or wrong. So, I don't care about if I'm the problem, I just need to know. I can't imagine that they are the good ones here. I'm feeling worse daily, physically and mentally, probably almost reached a state where I can never fully regenerate from ever again. So please, people of Reddit, tell me what to do, tell my about my parents rights and wrongs, what I should do.

If you have any more questions, please ask them. I haven't included even half of the problems in here, so don't be afraid to ask, I will happily answer everything you want to know! 

By the way, I feel like I should add this: I don't know much about other countries, but CPS isn't as easy in germany. I can't expect help from them as long as I don't get hit by them, or seriously injured another way. Which they don't do at the moment, except for some small hits when I showed no respect again in some discussion.

Oh yeah, it's 1am here rn and my English isn't the best, so please don't have a choke reading this lmao

Everyone who read this, I seriously thank you. For everything, even if you don't care, just because you listened to my problems already means a lot to me. Everyone reading this, have a great day, you deserve it the most!"

MaxDoggoAttack,depression,1620454172.0,Felt like I had to let this out tonight.," Don't really know where to begin even if I keep trying to so here is this word vomit: I've lost all appreciation for my studies since Covid hit. That had been my acnhor since the beggining and I was doing well, but now I can't even complete a single assigment and they keep pilling up. I have almost failed out twice simply for not doing my assignments and I don't know how to continue. I also lost my job recently. Plus, everyday is a struggle and I have to find ways to distract myself in order to simply be sane. I can't really express myself very well when other people ask if I'm okay, although I say yes always I'm secretly rotting inside. Sometimes I simply wish to walk away from it all, to dissapear from friends and families and lose myself in a part of the world I don't really understand. However, I'm pretty sure I would end up perishing in the first few weeks, but that doesn't seem to bad. I don't know if I like life anymore, everything good just sort of dissapears or fades away with time. Even activities I used to enjoy are slowly losing their touch. Eventually, I'll have nothing left. How the hell am I suppose to be an adult when I can't even figure out how to life until tommorow. Hell, I can't even do shit without drinking a few beers to simply numb my ever anxious mind into oblivion. I don't want to push people away, but just look at this. No one deserves to read this, to feel like this or to try and deal with someone like this."

azallday,depression,1620644142.0,Very strong urge to disappear,"Anyone ever get the urge to just delete all of your social media accounts, change your phone number, and move across the country?

I've been thinking about this a lot. I don't feel particularly attached to any of my friends. I'm certain this is my depression talking and not reality but that knowledge doesn't change my perception. 

I feel like nobody loves me and nobody cares about me. I feel like I'm a failure and I feel like I'm a disappointment and I feel like I'm a burden. 

I, logically, shouldn't be feeling this way. I'm graduating college this week and I could not care less about it. I was literally more excited for Falcon and the Winter Soldier to come out. 

I just wish I could disappear without a trace and never speak to **anyone** that I know in my life now. 

I just want to start over and live my life with no expectations."
TheNumbahSeven,depression,1620578226.0,I'm afraid of her...,"(as I am writing this she is sitting next to me we're in a car).

I've been spanked by this woman all my life. And I always cower in fear whenever she come near me. And I feel now that she's hiding something as serious as sexual assault from me. 

 I have been suspicious that I might've been raped as a young child, because I have really bad bedwetting problems when I was younger and when I asked my mom about that issue shes quick to dismiss it. I feel like I have. Even though our memories are so blurry, the abuse as a child is so far awhile. The Pedophilia encounter I had remembering almost agreeing to becoming a sugar baby. I suffered from a supposed ""kids chat"" I just fee like something isn't right. Like somewhere I feel like my memories of the rape I had. I can't seem to remember it. And when I bring it up to somebody my family seems to brush it off. Also whenever I talk to a family friend my mom lectures and insists I might've been sexually involved with them. If I never have been. The one time It happened (I will call him Joe). I was just saying hi to our family friend Joe. But my mom and step dad thought I was having sex with him. All because the nosy bus driver saw me talking to them. Like... Is that odd? Because they are friends with the guy who I said hi to. I also remember vividly almost agreeing to have sex with a boy at 13/14 in a residential home I was in (It was intersex). I almost never went through with it. (Thank God)! I never saw the dude again. Was for the best, because his temper is as bad as a storm. Because I always thought he might beat me if I did anything slightly wrong, I already have memories of abuse at a younger age. Which caused my DID and Trauma. And why I flinch whenever someone raised their hand or try and high five me. 

What also makes it worse, she smokes and I begged her to stop because it makes me cough really badly. She  yells at me and tell me to shut up, I also tried to call the cops on her to escape her. But they did nothing stating if I'm under her care then I should abide by her rules. 

What rules? She also almost suffocated one of our Alters Octavia to death by pressing her weight on us, restraining us. We begged her to stop to the point that the cops were involved and I was sent to the mental hospital, I hate how she treats me. I'm planning to run away once I get the chance. Because she never listens to me, like whenever I don't listen to her she gets upset. And I ask her why don't you listen to me. She always says I am an adult I don't have to listen to you. She prevents me from getting a job, she also doesn't let me do anything I feel like a prisoner in my own home. She always makes ""deals"" which are half assed deals. Like I would get a job or learn how to drive when daddy gets home (Step dad is in prision and she's so hopeful hes coming out but he isn't) So. I am Afriad of my mom who is a control freak."
Bleven,depression,1620575157.0,Been depressed for as long as I can remember.,"My mom passed away 1.5 years ago at 71.  I know that sounds old to some but her mom lived until 97 and her grandmother until 99 so I thought I would have more time.  It's not just that dad's got Alzheimer's sister and I were never close so it feels like I have no family left at all. 

I'm in my late 40s and this just isn't how I imagined life, I have no friends or any goals or things I care about. I can't think of one thing I actually want to do. I feel like I am getting weaker mentally and physically by the day.   Maybe it's because I never had kids but I don't see the point of life. I have seen everything there is to see and done everything I care to do. I don't want to hurt myself but I do feel like I finished my life a couple of decades back and I am just waiting for the ride to finally stop.

I have very bad anxiety and OCD so even if I get the desire to go out in the world, I have to complete a long cleaning ritual which is tiring physically and mentally as I tend to spaz out and panic about getting sick. I guess this is just a rant thanks to anyone who read it."

Jason5Lee,depression,1620544226.0,Depression ruined my life.,"I used to be a good college student. I got high scores in my courses, I had a good relationship with my classmates, and most importantly, I loved my school life.  
Everything changed in the second year of college. I got depression and I started losing motivation to study and communicate. I became anxious and painful. I lost my friends and failed my courses, and my GPA went from the top to the bottom.

I was diagnosed with depression when my parents discovered my changes and sent me to the doctor. I started my treatment and I started recovering. I'm still fighting with depression today but I can at least get my things done.

But the thoughts of my life is ruined always haunt me. I always fall into thinking that I used to be a good student with a good GPA and a good relationship. I could become successful, maybe get into a better University for a Master's degree, or get a job in a good company and started my own career.

But I ruined it all because of my weakness. Now my GPA is trash, people around me don't like me, my parents are disappointed, my future is gloomy, I can never become who I was. Sometimes I even wanted to end my life because ""my life is already ruined"". I feel like I have lost the meaning of my life, and I have no reason to continue."

At 15 I was diagnosed with major depression
At 18 I was diagnosed with anorexia and bpd

I've been diagnosed with a number of other conditions but these are the most prevalent. For as long as I can remember i have wanted to die, or at least have wanted to end the mental pain life brings.
One of my earliest memories was an odd one. I was 6 years old and sitting next to my mum, and I remember asking her ""can I die?"" all whilst sincerely wishing that would happen.
From the age of 8 I have expressed concern and distaste in my existence, and have on regularity apologized to my parents for being alive, for wasting their time and money and energy.

I've always felt loved and cared for, yet despite that I have never felt worthy of love and care. Over the years I have be compelled to do anything in my power to NOT be loved and cared for; my most recent attempt was me ghosting my family for a few days before unknowingly returning (disassociated and returned home without realizing).

I've never had a job, I've never been to higher learning, I've done nothing but cause pain to myself and others. I'm a complete fuck up and a complete burdnern to anyone that comes into contact with me. 
I'm losing my friends and my family are starting to get sick of my bullshit and have a number of times wanted to kick me to the curb.

I see no goals in life, no reason to live. The eminence guilt I have for being mentally screwed up is huge, and the guilt I have for wanting to die is even worse. 
The only reason I'm still alive is because of my guilt and self hatred; if I was selfish I would die, if I loved myself enough to die i would, but living is more of a punishment than death.

My only goal in life is to become even worse. Its to become homeless, loveless, forgotten by the world and by those who care for me. I want everyone who doesn't hate me to hate me, and for those who love me to revolt me. I want and I deserve to be a faceless husk, suffering until i die some horrible death. I need to suffer before I die, and onlt after I have suffered can I end my life."

I plan to read it in few years, like a book. Will put in ""*\[text\]*"" the notes I discovered years later.

**TL;DR : Lol. Not even sorry.**

\-----

**1) Early life/Behaviour**

Since i'm born, i'm a lonely wolf. I was a quiet child, playing in my room without a lot of noises, never yelling or crying according to my mom and my whole family. My mom usually had to check on me if I still was in my room, or if I was hungry etc. + I was a good student, good marks (until 12-13yo), never disrespectful towards teachers (or anybody). I was just too quiet and never ask to participate in classroom.

*\[I'm still a lonely wolf today, I REALLY need time alone to feel good, playing games or just talking to myself or not talking at all for few hours, nothing related with depression. Plus, I now tend to be rude to people, felling jealous about what I had to do to be ""normal"" when they complain about her coffee being a bit too cold or stuffs like this\]*

My parents divorced when I was 8. Let's say my early life ends there. Before that, the only memories I have are:

\- No memories about my father

\- My mother struggling to help my with homework

\- My brother being the bad boy at home (he's 6years older), and getting bad grades

\- School being easy and I'm not interested into making friends, I used to watch the cars at the window or doing exercises (I remember maths only, dunno why) *\[I was more mature than other kids of my age, so they seemed boring to me\]*

\- At home I usually spent a lot of time alone as my parents were busy arguing (pre-divorce ""gift"")

*\[I was too young to figure out what the divorce was, that's why my memories seem random, but today I know why I have these specific memories\]*

\--------

**2) Divorce and post divorce**

After the divorce, my brother and I were going to with my father. The news I had were : We lack a lot of money that our mother stole, she disappeared and didn't want to see us again, my father would work a lot (4am-9pm) to get money at home.

Once again, I wasn't very impacted, I was still playing video-games, getting good grades, and I was still silent and polite. At this time, it spent many hours per day playing videogames (Diablo II, Warcraft III) and nothing else. At this time, I was playing with older people online, and it was nice.

I saw my mother, about 10-15 days in 10 years. I didn't get why I had to go to her place if she wasn't interested in seeing us. My brother was angry to her, refusing to visit her, I usually went alone and as i was a child, I mostly... played with toys/games. Was a bit weird to see her as I thought she left us, but I didn't care that much, I was only interested into playing. But when I came home, I always had my father talking bad about my mother, saying she tried to buy me when I had new toys or when we went to the restaurant. At this time, I obviously had no link with my mother, and I slowly lost it with my father too.

*\[My mother was the one who had no money, and had to create a whole new life, plus spending all her freetime crying about the situation and trying to get us back, when I went to her place, it was a very good moment for her, even if I was only playing and eating at restaurant, she didn't know what to do else. My mother's family told her I was stubborn af and I'd never fall into my father's propaganda despite my brother. They were right.*

*I guess at this time I lost my self-esteem, I was used by both my parents to their advantage without even thinking about my feelings\]*

Obviously, I was like a nerd, i never used my phone even if I was lucky to have one at this time, I never went out to see friends or even seeing the sun. My life was playing video-games, showing the teacher I understand the lesson and looking at my brother trying to cook basic meals. (Note: my father was working hard, so my brother and I were alone in the house 90% of time, as he only came to sleep on weekdays and only being there on weekends + I was in a bad area, other kids were rly bad at school, I wasn't a genius, just a serious kid.)

At this time, I didn't feel depressed. But everything was set up.

*\[I learnt years later that my father manipulated us and my mother to separate us. He told her we weren't there or didn't want to see her, and he told us she left without giving news. My mother tried to find a legal solution, but it took sooo long. I got 18 before the process could end. The divorce was asked by my mother, because of my father's drinking issues. Seems he spent more time drinking than working while my brother and I were struggling on how to cook a frozen pizza. Talking about my brother, my father's propaganda worked a lot of him, because my father said thing like ""You can't have gift for your birthday because of your mother's divorce"", luckily I wasn't impacted as I never expect anything for my birthdays or in general\]*

\----

**3) The depression**

When I got around 12, I went to middle school, I discovered a new world, as the building was also a high school and had superior student. I was a young man facing 20yo people. Was a shock for me, I only knew my videogames and some basic school stuffs. And from now, many lessons/subjects, many student, many personalities (It was a private school, and I came from a public elementary school). At this time, the worst episode of my life began. People in this school were huge groups, and when you have a little nerd not talking, it's easy to insult/criticize him.

\+ Important point, I smelled bad everyday, didn't know why, even few hours after taking a shower. *\[Discovered at about 17 that I had a malformation, I can now control it, only my wife is impacted now as we live together\]*

I was the guy who smelled bad since elementary school (from 6yo to 16-17yo).

I was rejected by everybody, even the teachers started to ask if I took shower everyday. Was unbearable. the students always found a way to be united against me. At this time, I started a depression, but I kept it in my mind, because I just never thought about any advantage of talking about it to someone else (rather than myself), I just focused on video-games to escape this reality. My self-esteem reached 0% at this time.

Once, I replied to a guy that I could kill him if he did not shut up, in front of my whole male class (we were in changing room before sport). He thought I'd be afraid to get hit, but I ran like an animal on him, I wanted to fight to release the pressure. I realized he was afraid of me even before hitting him. Other boys went to separate us. At this time, I realized I have the Power. I could take a decision I want even if it's not objectively a good one.

The next year, at 13. I had two bad events (in addition to the one above). My teachers were VERY BAD, like 18th century teacher, or teacher giving bonus points to exams if you have a beautiful textbook (I was a nerd with no parental education, my textbooks were a bunch of drafts). So my grades started to fall down for no reason. + My father started to meet other women, the week-ends we were alone with my brother or worse, we had to meet his changing new girlfriend (and their kids, friends etc.) SO I got less and less time alone. SO I was less and less happy. He finally met a girl, who had an identical life. A perfect match. At this time, I started to notice that SHE was drinking a lot, and I slowly noticed that my father did it too. In the evening we could hear them laughing, talking out loud or....having fun until late in the night.

I made my first review of myself at 13, just before my birthday (I remember a picture of me taken with my birthday cake while watching straight to the camera and thinking ""I'm really not good rn""). This is an important picture to me, as it is the farthest memory of me felling depressed. I probably was before, but can't remember precisely.

From there, I don't have a lot to comfort me:

\- School grades were going bad (I was expected to fail my year)

\- School relations were the worst (I was known by everybody for bad reasons)

\- My father was absent, spending his free-time drinking or with his gf, my grades weren't that bad for him as he never understood the point of studying.

\- My brother was as lost as me, but as he was older, the spent time on parties drinking and taking drugs. (bad ending, don't do drugs.)

\- I have my ""issue"", and I don't know how to act with, and everybody (family, other students included) thought I was just a teenager who does not take showers.

\-This situation made me realize I also couldn't resolve anything, I did NOTHING in my life except playing video-games, literally nothing, I don't listen to music, I don't watch movies, I don't watch TV, I don't get out. Like during the COVID, but during my whole life and without Internet. And this point, leads me straight to a deep depression.

*\[This situation was unfortunate bad events showing up at the same time, but the biggest issue to me at this time was ""not being like other kids"" who went to cinema, got fashion clothes, had some love relationships, etc. and seeing that my youth will never be the same. Today's life is still impacted by this issue, I often don't know simple things people know since childhood + My father was drinking more than usual since he met his gf, as he spent less time working, and more time at home\]*

On my family side, my fathers decided to stop working a lot to have a normal life with his gf, whom he married. So he had less money for gifts, but more time for drinking.

*\[Once again, money wasn't an issue itself, he got a lot of money by working, but he spent ALL of it in alcohol, leaving nothing left for us. My brother and I now have 1001+ stories about all the lies/situation we had, like once he went on a week vacation with his second wife, and emptied the fridge, leaving me alone for 2 days with NOTHING to eat except olive oil and some half-eaten butter. He even took the sponges! I was still a student with 0 money at this time (obviously). Or when he tried to say that I had a handicap to allow me not to go to school and look for a job. So I could help him financially.*

*I never invited anybody to my house because I was ashamed to show my father to anybody\]*

\-----

**4) The suicid attempt**

*\[Not a long part, but was the separation between my early life and today's life, so it deserves a whole chapter\]*

Remember when I said i had the Power to take decisions ?

When I was 14, I was fully depressed, but my brother was trying to leave the house so he didn't saw me falling, and my father was drinking. At school, they were shocked that I went from top 10% best student to 10% worst in 1 year, they didn't know what to do except menacing me to be expulsed from this private school. (My father paid for it, and it was tough for him to pay something for me, so he was kinda ok to put me back to public school)

One day, as I was walking to school by feet (My father didn't pay for bus/bike obviously), I stopped by. I asked myself : 'Do I want to go to school ?"" Then ""Do I want to go home ?"". ""What do I want"" ? Leaving my life ? Yes.""

We had recently moved out to a new town, but near enough for my school. I knew how to go to school, but I didn't know the city at all. + I'm REALLY bad a orientation. Even today.

So, I decided a simple plan. I knew a couldn't try to kill me with a knife or medication, because I couldn't with 100% chance one-shot me (I learnt it from video-games) so I had to find a perfect solution. It was to get lost. "" What if I walk straightforward, taking sometime to the left, or right, lost in my thoughts ? I'd be totally lost, until I die and obviously cannot go back as I am bad at orientation and have no phone."" The plan was perfect. Nobody could follow/find me as I had no plan, no goal.

BUT, it worked so well, that i didn't notice that I was on THE MAIN ROAD leading straight to my house. My brother randomly found my while driving in the city, looking for me. I'm not able to make the difference between a small dead-end road and a huge street full of cars. Sounds crazy today, but I almost never left my house, I didn't know.

*\[I learnt a lot of things:*

*- My fathers just drank a bottle when school called him to announce I wasn't at school, and thought I was just a stupid teenager that would go back home when I'd be hungry.*

*- My mother got called by my brother, and came to my house after several years without any news*

*-I almost told nothing about why I left the house to the policemen, nurses and my family, I only said after 5-6 hours of silence that I had issue with my father. I when to a psychologist, and after 1 session, I noticed this one was freaking bad. She explained me that she would be a parrot between my father and me, she thought I wanted to talk to him, lol.\]*

\----**5) Waiting ?**

Surprisingly, no apocalypse after this. I just changed school to a public one, so my grades went back again (no textbook checking anymore, only classic exams). I met the nerds group of this new school, and i'm still playing video-games at home. This was almost a good thing I tried to leave.

My father and his new wife remain the same, drinking and not really paying attention to us, as long as we don't cause troubles that would cost money.

Personally, I began to change, I wanted to fight, I wanted to be alone, to find a solution to all my issues. I wasn't the quiet/shy boy anymore, Life is shit, and i'll shit on it. Not even sorry.

At 15-16, I reach high school. I'm quite a good student as I'm way less disruptive and got better grades and most of the students. (At this time, I never did any homework or learnt any lesson since my parents divorced) I also start to control my smelling issue. But obviously, it's not easy everyday to keep up the good habits. Anyway, the elementary/middle school was the worst period of my life, and I was decided not to be fucked up 3 mores years.I fought two times, once with a high school student for no real reason and second time with a random guy who tried to steal my phone on the street.I met a girl who was shy af, looked like me when I was young, lost in this school, wishing to get her diploma as fast as possible. When I spoke to her, she was surprised a man would find interest in her (other than she's the smart little girl who cries when we yell at her). *\[What I thought was love, was only compassion. But once again, I didn't know. Important sentence for the the final thoughts at the end\]*

I knew I had to leave my father's house ASAP, my studies were a total mess. I only thought about leaving the house, I lied about getting a diploma *\[Which is still never told to anyone\]* and looked for a job at 20yo.

I got my fake diploma in January 2nd. I left my father's house on January 7th. I lived at my gf's house for several months, then in September we went in our first flat as I was working since few months. *\[A good point is that I was not a fool, I managed in 1 year to make my manager leaving the team to get his job\].*

I left a note for my father saying I leave because of his drinking issues, but according to my brother and neighbors, they only thought I was manipulated by my gf.

My father never met his two grandchildren until this day, maybe a picture leaked from FB, but that's all.

\------

**6) The first day of the rest of my life**

So, until today. I tried to get back everything I didn't have in my childhood, watching movies I never seen, spending money for my happiness (Was hard to buy my Netflix subscription). I can't even hold a glass of alcohol in front of my children, I have a driving license since 2014 but I still drive like a teenager. Many reminders of my early life, not talking about the ""Hoo, I remember that candy when I was a kid, don't you ?"" No, I had no childhood.

I met my mother since I left the house, we discussed a lot and I decided she was a nice person, even if I'll never see her as a mother. She saw her grandchildren and is very happy, she even has news from my brother. The wheel of fortune reversed at her advantage.

I noticed I have severe self-esteem issue until today. My wife naturally adapted her behavior and know I'm like a child to her, she often yell for nothing, which should lead to an argue as a couple, but I still can't' do that. She wanted kids, I didn't, now we have 2 children.

About children. I love them both. Like really, since i'm a father I really want them to have a normal life, and being there for them when they will be sad. I sincerely do my best to give them a good education. The older one is at school now, and seems not to be shy at all even if he's 1year younger, he's full of energy and loves to play with me, he gets angry sometimes (when we serve green vegetables), something I almost never did, I guess that's a good point for him. The second one is still young today, but we found how to make her laugh, so everything is going well. I don't want to leave them alone as a was.

&#x200B;

But since I'm a father, I realized nobody else is of interest to me. Even myself, I still don't like to do things for me, like deciding where to go for holidays, or choosing a restaurant, etc. I know what I want, but I still can't say it out loud.

Even my wife, I have seen her as the path to escape my past life, and now the mother of my kids, no love involved. Tbh, she also has some troubles, she was a brilliant student and thinks she is ""superior"" to other people. And i'm not helping. So I often see my wife arguing with my kids when she is tired because he's making noises while playing with his toys. She usually sleep in the afternoon because at this time my son is tired too, and easily crying/yelling. Leaving me alone to deal with him. I sleep about 5hours per night, while she easily reach 12-13h since the Covid happened. And obviously, I'm getting grounded when  I do something she doesn't like (example, cooking pizza when she wants something else, but obviously, i'm not allowed to wake her up to ask)

My only wish is almost the same as always: Being alone, with myself... and my kids. My wife is a good reminder of that. She's the last thing from my past life.

**7) Final thoughts + Updates?**

Today I feel like an old man waiting for the cancer to kill him, while giving love to his kids/grandkids and totally not thinking about himself. I'm 27yo today. I don't want to change (I mean, seeing a psychologist) because I know I'd have to divorce if I want to heal properly (I need to be alone, that's the main condition for me to feel good). And I don't want my children to live this. I'll wait maybe 20-25 years (when they'll leave the house) to really decide if I want a good ending or a bad one. Being a father is something unexpected that will restraint my dark ideas for years. I love my children.

&#x200B;

I don't expect any answer, or just some grammar correction if someone else read that. This post is like a photo album, will come sometimes to remind me of some events, maybe I'll add updates next years or rewrite some chapters. Dunno yet."
LutzEgner,depression,1620594896.0,"I got told 'I love you' for the first time in my life, but it feels hollow.","All my life I have been longing for harmony in my social life, for a partner that understands me, just someone who loves me the way I simply am.

I am 33 years now and never really had a relationship. I can't count how often I have been rejected already. Almost always it is 'I don't want to risk our friendship, you are a  really cool dude' etc you know the drill.

I have been diagnosed with a severe Depression when I was 17.

I eventually through luck found a girl who liked me 6 years ago. Problem was she didn't live near me, thus eventually a long distance 'relationship' formed. We talked all day, how nice we found each other etc.

Then, out of the blue, one day her mother calls me crying, telling me that her daughter killed herself the day before. You can't even imagine how much that threw me off. There were no signs that she was suffering, she left no suicide note and to this day I still dont know why this person removed herself forcibly from my life.

My depression worsened and eventually (last year) it was so bad that I literally did  NOTHING for days. Not even getting food. I didnt pay my rent and got thrown out of my Apartment, making me a homeless person.

Thanks to my mother I got put in a psyvh ward last september, (it was my 5th visit in such an institution). They helped me get back atleast some money, helped me find a nice new flat of which I am very proud to have decorated. It is very cozy.



I also met a girl there. We instantly hit off, talked all day there. She was only a few days there, could go home eventually. I gathered all my courage and ask for her phone number, to my surprise she said she was about to ask the same. She instantly messaged me back, invited me to her place, cooked something for me, introduced her family to me as well. This continued over a month, long after I got out of the psych ward. I fell in love with her right there. The problem is, she is in a relationship.

Fast forward to today, its still the loving atmosphere when she is here, everything is nice. But I know its not genuine for some reason. Everytime I want to end the contact between us, I cant. I wanted to do it again, yesterday. She told me she loved me as well. I would die for that woman, I would really do, but something tells me it was just to keep me on 'the leash' if you know what I mean.

I don't want to badmouth her in any way, but I dont know what to do. My depression makes me think about her all day, I cant do anything about it.
Shouldn't it feel good if someone tells those words to you? To me it didn't.

I just feel so fucking lonely, I wish everything was true but in my heart I wish it isn't, and this destroy me. I just want everything to be good.


I am sorry this turned into a long rant, it helped me atleast."

My parents care about my grades then my mental or physical help. I love my parents a lot and there amazing in every cagegory except when it comes to school. I can’t live up to there expectations and I can’t stand that there so disappointed in me. I get grounded and lectured because I don’t get the best grades like I used too before online school. They always say “I know you can do better than this” but I really fucking can’t. Also I’ve been hopping schools do to bullying and covid which had made it really hard to meet friends that aren’t online. In the real world I’m completely alone because the only time I see my classmates is through a computer screen. But I have so many friends online and they make me happy. But whenever my parents get the slightest bit unhappy with me they shut off the WiFi entirely and cut all my social contact. This means it’s hard to keep plans and keep steady and realignment friends because no one knows when I’ll just be shut off without warning. I can’t explain al in detail but I help people with mental problems like anxiety and depression and talk with them like a junior therapist but they always give me all there problems to deal with and normally that’s fine I like to help people,  but recently it’s too much and I can’t handle all of there problems. But at the same time I can’t just ghost them because then they wouldn’t have any one to talk too, I feel like my life is so meaningless that my only purpose it to make sure others around me are happy, recently my parents have been more strict and I’ve spent less and less time with my friends which had brought back habits like cutting and not eating. I fell so lonely all the ducking time and my depression anxiety and ADHD are not making it any better. I can’t explain in full detail all the shit in my life that’s happening but a lot more than this. I’m really struggling to find a reason to get up every day. I am so fucking lonely and I just want some realll friends. What’s the point in living anyway if it’s just hell and pain until you die. I don’t understand I can’t take it any more, I see these people with perfect lives in the real  life and it fictional stories. if any lne sees this ill make another post and ask about other things but really just wanted to vent and ask for help.

I'm overwhelmed at the desertion of everyone who says they love me leaving me. I have never been one to easily make friends bc I do not trust people at all. Walls are extremely high. I don't know what to do but I'm at the end of my hope.
EmbarrassingIdea,depression,1620445395.0,Am I actually depressed or just an edgy teen?,"So recently I’ve been feeling down. I just feel like my entire life is just constant stress, that no matter how much schoolwork I do, theres always more and its been putting a strain on me.
I also act differently around different friends and different when with family and I don’t know which is my actual self. I think I’ve just been fabricating personalities for so long that I forgot what my real one was.
And heres the depression part. Recently, whenever I am wrong or I don’t know how to do something, I’ll berate myself and convince myself that I’m useless. I considered suicide but thought that my parents would miss me. I also don’t know if my friends actually like me or if Im being clingy and they actually hate me but they are confrontational enough to tell me.
For an example of what I tend to do when I feel this way, yesterday, I couldn’t understand my homework, so I cried for thirty minutes, got a bloody nose and then told myself I was worthless. I don’t feel like I’m worth anything but the issue is, I don’t know if I actually believe that or if I’m just telling myself that to be edgy.

So thats the entire thing but I kinda need to rant, so I’ll add some things here but they’re not really relevant to my question. So I’m bisexual, I told my mom, step dad, brother, and grandma. I never told my dad and I don’t know why. So I’m also about 60% sure I’m genderfluid, but the last 40% is mainly because, like with my depression, I don’t know if its just a phase.


Sorry about this, this was mainly a rant and I have no idea if anyone can answer my question with this, so I’ll just to a tldr.

I think I’m worthless, useless, and that my friends hate me, but I don’t know if thats my actual thoughts or If im just being edgy."

gatorgirl84,depression,1620623137.0,I finally brushed my once beautiful hair and now it looks terrible!,"I've been unsuccessfully battling depression for some time. My waist length hair had become a matted gross mess after not brushing or washing it for 6+ months. I finally found the will and strength to get it all untangled. As soon as I started, I found myself excited and looking forward to having my hair back. My hair has always been thick and wavy with a tendency to frizz, especially in the summer. I'd wear it wavy/curly when it was humid out and straighten it during the drier months. I had good hair. It was difficult to manage but it was GOOD. I always got compliments on my hair, all my life. No matter what other insecurities I had with my body or appearance, my hair was always something I could depend on to give me a boost of confidence. 
It took me 6 days, 3 to 4 hours a day. I couldn't wait to wash it and trim the dead ends and have something to feel good about. After washing it last night I feel completely deflated. My hair looks terrible! It's almost like the top layer or two of hair all the way around my head has changed texture. It's really wiry looking. That's the only way I can really explain it. The hair doesn't lay together, it's almost like each strand is individually crinkled like frizz on steroids! I tried to straighten it but it hardly helped at all. It's from root to tip so it's not like I can cut it off. I don't know how to help/fix it and I'm trying so hard not to spiral but it's become increasingly difficult as the day has progressed. 

Has anyone else ever experienced this? Does it get better as I continue to care for it properly? It nearly sends me into a panic to think that the hair grew like this because of the way it was all tangled and matted and it's not going to get better until it grows out and I can chop it off. 

Please help!"

Bleshbelsh,depression,1620483159.0,I feel like I'm wasting people's time asking for support constantly,"TRIGGER WARNING: Mentions of self harm

I've been feeling so low these past few months. I am in therapy again and I feel like a major depressive episode is hitting again. I'm scared because my last one was so so tough to get out of.

I don't have any friends in the town I live in, but I know I'm lucky enough to have a few good friends abroad and in other cities. I just wish I had someone to hang out with physically.

I've been making myself seek support when I feel low, even though I feel so guilty when I do. Everyone's been so patient and my long distance boyfriend is the most amazing guy, but I feel like I'm just wasting his and people's time being so negative and needing so much support. It also feels endless... like I'm constantly not okay.

Sometimes my thoughts get so negative I feel like pulling all my hair out or smashing my head against a wall just so it all stops. Instead I've learned to just take really cold showers until I feel frozen and the pain of being so cold stops the emotional pain and I feel some relief.

I'm exhausted of feeling so tired and so low all the time and I'm scared that if I keep asking for support people will eventually get tired of me and leave just like most of them did when I was depressed last time.

stonerisinthename,depression,1620605635.0,Advice Needed,"Hello everyone, I write this today seeking advice and hoping that one of you lovely people could point me in the right direction. So to set it up I’ve had some mental issues for a while. Going all the way back to high school I have self-worth/confidence issues. Last year around this time I moved four hrs from home to pursue a career as an Air Traffic Controller. I am currently two semesters in and I absolutely love it. When I moved I either developed or noticed that I have BED(Binge Eating Disorder). I never saw someone professionally about BED and I will still occasionally have episodes. The BED doesn’t bother me that much because I can counteract it by going on runs and hitting the gym often. Over the past 2-3 months I have been experiencing some symptoms of depression along with the BED. This weekend I haven’t left my house and haven’t touched the dishes. There’s also a list of things that need to be done that I havent touched. I think I’m in the worst mental state I’ve ever been in. 

With that being said, I know the correct course of action. Go seek professional help and talk to someone about this. I am reluctant to do so though because if diagnosed with any mental disorders my career as an air traffic controller will be finished, I would have wasted over 100,000$ of my parents and grandparents money and I feel like I would let my family down since they scarificed so much to put me in this position in the first place.

All of these suck.

Masons_Redoubt,depression,1620439377.0,Going tonight.,"Long, dramatic read about my life ahead of you. Also wrote this on mobile so sorry for the format and mistakes 

Note: I posted this on r/suicidewatch just now as well, and figured that this would probably be a community that would resonate with some of what I said here too.


I'm tired of living my life. I feel like I've tried so many different times to change who I am. To catch up. To be a person who can speak coherently. To be a person who can be interested in things and put effort into them. To be a person who takes care of themselves. To be a person at all really. Haven't gotten anywhere in what feels years.

For context, I used to be pretty happy and on a good track when I was really young (4-10 years old). I had good friends, did well in school etc, but then I had to be fucking stupid and prioritize video games/internet over everything else. I started pretending I was sick and did everything I could during 5th grade to stay home and be on my computer, and for some reason, be it anxiety or charitablility/empathy, my mom played into it and let me do it. Eventually, It got out of control and there was a period where I got pneumonia and lobbied my parents to let me stay home for weeks which put me in a shitty position with the school I was going to. But that's okay! My mom has a solution. Online homeschool.

I think online homeschool can be done well and I don't think my mom was malicious. I truly and honestly think she wanted the best for me, but fuck me this was this not the way to go. I stayed at home every day all year round while, submerged my self in all sorts of media and, on a more positive note, did good with the little amount of school work I had to do. but most importantly I isolated myself in my room, and didn't talk to anyone for large periods of times, not even people online. I feel like this messed with my psyche a lot. I mean, imagine next to no experiences (in the form of personal ones, not learned ones) from the ages of 11-14. Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is, but either way, that period of my life has shaped me into the absolutely worthless fucking human being I am now. 

I've tried going back to school in person multiple times in middle school, and now highschool, and It's not worked out too well. I just can't effectively communicate ideas talking to people, and I struggle a lot with figuring out what people mean in writing and when they're speaking to me. I'm overall really stupid and lazy because of the lack of challenge I've had throughout my entire, even before I went to online homeschool, but I've gotten really good at gaming academics and speak in stilted language so a lot of people at my school and my age in general think I'm smart, in that sort of stereotypically autistic way. It's cringe, I'm cringe and so many of my interactions as result are very awkward. I genuinely hate myself too, I mean really hate myself, and it's done me 0 favors since now I have a much more negative identity which makes me want to be a edgelord. And usually I temper myself, but it's become much more difficult in the past year due to being right back in the same situation I was before in online school with covid and all, and of course that's caused my mental health to decline drastically. Leading me to the present actually.

If you haven't noticed too, there are a lot of details I've been leaving out and gaps in my recantation, and it's due to a lot of factors, but primarily depression and ???????. I have this sort of bizarre pesudo-state way of describing what happens in my mind, and it makes formulating what I feel into words fairly difficult, since if I stated it the way I usually think about it would soubd very strange and like I was talking about some sort of fantasy government, which it is. The other major reason is because my memory and ability to recall events has been damaged by depression and anxiety, which I've struggled with for years along all the other bullshit I've managed to do to myself. Point of all this being that this might all seem strange. (I'm not autistic by the way). Anyway on to the part that makes this post appropriate for the subreddit.

I'm 16 years old right now, and I'm going to kill myself tonight because I'm tired of the things I put myself through, and my repeated inability to deal with them. My parents are going away, and I have everything I need to pass peacefully and cleanly. I love my parents, but I don't want them to see me when I eventually become the deadbeat dipshit that I feel like I'm doomed to become if I keep living. I'm sorry for what they'll go through and I'm sorry for everyone I'll hurt. But this cannot go on anymore. I'll be here for a few hours after I post this, and then I'm attempting.

I now am required by law (Sweden) to show sobriety every week.

My relationship with my mom where sometimes i want to hang out with her like a normal mom, and sometimes i never want to see her again.

LoopingLou0306,depression,1620517082.0,I am a bad person but I don't want to be.,"This might be a long post.

In my life betrayal has been the norm.  My first memory is being beaten by my father while I was so young that I couldn't even roll over. So I have pain at the very center of my soul.  

Both of my parents abused drugs, along with me and my siblings. My mother wouldn't spank me, quite often she would punch me because I'm male. 

She would constantly start physical fights with my father, and she would use random objects as weapons. (She initiated almost ALL of the physical fights with my father).

After my dad left, things got worse.  My siblings and I would sometimes go days without supervision or food because my mother was out feeding her addiction, and my father was completely absent.

After moving in with my maternal grandmother, the physical abuse stopped, but I had to suffer near constant psychological abuse for being male.  My grandmother HATED men, and would constantly gas light me and take advantage of me.  

(Example: I was taught that a ""good man"" pays bills.  So I was forced to get a job under the table washing cars, and almost ALL of my money went to support the household...I was 12)

She would tell me to my face that I was basically expendable. ""Walk to the store and grab (x). I can't send your sister's because they might be kidnapped or raped."" 

She would let my mother back into the house periodically while I was at school. So, I would come home, and all of my game consoles would be gone, sold for drug money.  When I objected to my mother having access to the house, I was called a psychopath (she even compare me to Charles Manson).

When I started dating the gas lighting became worse. I ended up with a complete narrcists (because that was my ""normal""). When I tried asking for advice on how to deal with my then girlfriend, I was always met with one piece of advice, ""Get used to it. That's just normal behavior.""

This girl did a number on me, she physically abused me, and cheated on me. Again, when asking for advice (even from people who weren't in my family) I was told that I just didn't understand girl behavior.  Her actions weren't ""bad"" or ""evil"", I was just misinterpreting them.

By the time I was in my early 20s her and I had two children. She was an awful mother, constantly using my kids to manipulate me. When I finally had enough, I moved out and met the woman who would become my ex-wife.

Her emotional abuse was more subversive. She would refuse even the smallest request that I made of her. She would constantly do things like; pick at my skin whenever we were close (even during sex), refuse to shower and then demand sex, attempt to manipulate me into not hanging with my friends by accusing me of cheating, or set up shit to tests so that I could prove that I loved her.

I felt like I couldn't leave her I wanted to give my kids a stable environment to grow up in...well at least more stable than my family was.

After a few years of this I snapped.  I noticed a commonality between the behavior of all of the women that abused me, and built a psychological profile that allowed to me manipulate women. (At least women with a similar profile to my abusers)

I was able to use that model to accurately predict the behavoir of my mother, wife, and many other women.  Then I became extremely toxic. I decided to put my model to the test and began testing it by sleeping with MANY women. I justified this because all of the girls that I had dated used sex to force compliance. 

I would see some of the same egocentric narrcisim that my female abusers displayed, so I didn't feel sorry for any of them. To be honest, it really hurt me too.

First, it violated my own sense of right and wrong. Before I snapped I had only been with a total of 3 women, and 2 of them were long term monogamous relationships.

Second, with every woman I slept with, I could feel my bias and disdain grow larger, and larger.  I was very angry that being honest and direct seemed to a suboptimal strategy for dealing with romance.

I came to a terrible conclusion that in this world, you're either predator or prey.  

So I'm left in a place where I cannot trust. I have sworn off romantic interactions because I can't make sense of them.

I know that I hurt a lot of people, including my children.  I feel the worst for them, because they didn't deserve it at all. Only the very worst people hurt the innocent, and that's what I did.

It feels like everything is awful. 

Expecting monogamy seems extremely foolish, and sleeping with multiple women is dangerous and irresponsible.

It feels like there are NO good choices. Theres no way to be good. If you're honest you're taken advantage of and it hurts.  If you're dishonest you can take advantage of others, but that hurts too.

I dont know what to do, or how to think. I have no idea how to define ""good behavior"". I can create effective strategies, but that's not the same thing and being a good person.

I know that what I've done is awful, but I have no idea how to be ""good""...."

I was scared. 
I was scared because I couldn’t do anything against it. 
Eventually tears started to flow.
But it wasn’t sad either. 
I still stood there smiling.
Tears of fear. 
The only control I had left.

I think it’s getting worse.

I know I need help.
But I don’t know how."

raggio_Fiore,depression,1620576978.0,I just want to die in my sleep because I'm scared of killing myself,"My life have been a series of bad choices. I am 34 yrs old and I haven't achieved anything. The only future I had was lookkng forward to a life with my boyfriend, but that's not going to happen anymore. We still live together, and he is moving his new boyfriend in with us. He says he still loves and cares for me, but not like ""that"" anymore. I left before, I actually did but I came back because I thought we were going to try to make it work. We have 2 dogs and a cat. I keep telling myself, that it's better if I stay here to take care of them. But whenever I sleep I keep forcing myself to believe this life is a dream and whatever I wake up to is my real life. I tried to jump of a bridge, but it just ended up scratched and bruised. I work 2 jobs now since the pandemic. I tell people asking why I have to jobs that I just want more money and take advantage of working from home. I tried to believe that too. But I think I'm just trying to exhaust myself until I can't do anything anymore. I'm HIV positive. One of the times that my boyfriend had been seeing another person, I looked for those massage therapists and had sex. I'm not sure that's where I got it, but I have it now.  I am taking meds but I'm tired of it. And oh yes, throughout the the entirety of our relationship my boyfriend cheated on me a lot of times. I tried to stab myself in the heart with a knife before, but I did it slowly and stopped because it hurt. Now I'm suffering some thyroid issue I'm not sure where or how I got and trying to get treated for it. So my no longer boyfriend's sister is here with her bf visiting. So there's 5 of us in the house. They left for the province 2 days ago and I was left by myself here because I have work. It felt lonely and freeing at the same time. Now they're back. I was dozing off and getting the feeling that I was about to dream, then they knocked on the door. I was just really hoping that the dream I was having was my ""real"" life and this was the dream now nightmare that I need to wake up from. But they knocked, and now I'm awake and making this post.

I'm sorry if my sentences and thought process are jumbled, I'm not usually like this. But I just really wished that I ""woke"" up from this dream to my real life and now everything feels heavy."
Marescio,depression,1620517070.0,"To those that went through therapy / meds / both, were finished with them and came out the other end successfully, how long did it work for you? Because after a couple of years I'm relapsing hard.","Bacially, what the title says. Went through several therapists, a venlafaxine dose of 300mg for some time, and things seemed to get better. Didn't have much to talk about anymore at my sessions eventually, so we decided it had been enough. I was glad to not have to worry anymore about taking my meds on time. I got a well paying job, and recently even moved into a new place. But it doesn't matter I guess, because now, several years after therapy, I feel like I'm in it all over again. Same depression and suicidal thoughts. Has anybody had a similar experience? Or did it work out better for you?

I really, really don't want to through all of it again."

CarlosMartinEdward,depression,1620641612.0,"I can't seem to ever think of myself as a ""good person"". (Tw: self-hatred)","Whether it's due to past actions, thoughts or feelings, there's always something to taint how I view myself.

Sometimes it's stupid, trivial stuff I mess up in my day-to-day life or memories of dumb things I did as a child. Other times, it's a political stance that I should know better about or be in agreement with but for some reason l don't, a bad habit that I know I should change and the fact that I refuse dictates my character, my emotional immaturity and sexual frustration that makes me think I shouldn't be craving a partner, let alone looking for one. All these reasons, either by themselves or in conjunction, are always hammering in my head the judgement that I'm just... not a good person.

But what does that even mean? What defines these metrics of ""good"" and ""bad"" personhood? It's certainly not a standard I hold other people by, so why do I do it to myself? Why do I think of myself differently from everybody else? Are my mistakes any different from everyone else's? At first glance that would obviously be false, but it all comes crashing down when I ask: if they are truly mistakes, why do I keep repeating them? Why don't I learn from them? Why do I keep going down paths I know to be wrong?

Why do I not change?

That's where my innocence dies. At the accusation that my errors aren't accidental, but deliberate. That I consciously choose to continue doing what I know it's bad for me, or maybe even others, but I'm either too deep in a comfort zone to be bothered or make up excuses to avoid what, by my own stabdards, is a moral imperative.

And so I apologize. Over and over. Out loud. Everytime something like this crosses my mind, I let out a single ""I'm sorry!"", or perhaps several in succession. At first it was just in my head, then it evolved to whispering, now it's either a full on vocal burst or an anxious mantra I find myself enunciating several times a day. But am I really sorry? Sorry for what? Do I regret being who I am or am I just excusing the call out? How can I be sorry if I can't seem to ever take responsibility, even for what's in my head?

It's like I actually want this.

But I don't. I mean... I want to think I don't. Yet I still can't shake the feeling that I deserve it. That I chose this life, this mindset, and therefore I need to just shut up and deal with it. How can I ask for help if this is my own fault? How can I ask for help if I refuse to change? How dare I ask for help if I did this on purpose?

Suddenly, what seemed to be minor revealed a potential side of me that's... ugly to look at. A side I feel has no place in this world. I may avoid it all I want, but it's always there, lurking, and every deviation reminds me of it.

Some tell me I should just put in an effort and change. Others say I need to just accept it as a part of me and move on. These two stances seem to be in direct contradiction of one another, and I'm constantly battling between the two. Nothing is as black and white as I make it out to be, which is ironic given the title of this post. I have yet to find out how to effectively break my cycle of self-hatred. I know that wouldn't magically solve my issues, but at least I would not deliberately make it all worse. Handle things for what they are, and not as a mirror of my worst self.

I don't know what being a good person even is anymore, or if that's who I should be. I just don't want to be the bad person I fear and hate so much."

Bubbly_Lime-666,depression,1620498321.0,My anti depressants are ruining me.,I’ve been through the ringer when it comes to anti depressants. I’ve been on and off of them since 13 I’ve tried so many I don’t even count anymore but I’m currently struggling with one huge issue I also face. My libido. I have no sec drive... zero. I don’t even want to think about it because it almost grosses me out and makes me feel awkward. This just recently started about 3 years ago and I’ve been struggling with it since.

I just want to sleep. I'm only 23 and I so badly want to get better but this feeling is always creeping under my skin. I wish I was beautiful and deserving of love. I'm made up of only jagged pieces, chaos, I am a disaster."
Throwaway31273891,depression,1620532880.0,Im thinking of ending things,"I know theres a a good chance that nobody reads this. But writing these kinds of things helps even if only a little bit so I dont really give a shit. I am currently 16 years old and extremely fucking lonely. I do have a group of friends but Im starting to feel like Im not hanging out with them because I actually enjoy their company, but because It takes my mind off of all the shit that I think about when im alone. And I'm afraid that if I leave that group of friend I will legitimately hurt myself. Half the time when Im with them Im not even socializing, I just feel like Im gonna say the wrong thing and embarrass myself. 

 My uncle commited suicide when I was younger, I was only 6 years old at the time and I dont really have any memories of him. But ever since I was a child I have been told by my family that I resemble him extremely. To the way I sit, the way I act and look, pretty much anything you can think of. This has me wondering if it was meant to be. 

I take drugs almost every day. Mostly Mariljuana as in the state I live in you can get it almost anywhere, and nobody gives a shit if you smoke. However I've started vaping, drinking, and taking LSD. As emo as this may sound I take them to help numb my mind. So far the only one that can succeed in that consistently is alcohol. But that shits hard to get. I feel like I don't want to take drugs, half the time they just make me feel like shit. But as mundane and tedious as my life is I feel like it just gives me something interesting to do. 

I've been neglected by my parents ever since I was a child. And honestly I don't blame them. Actually I should say that I don't blame my mom. Because she has an excuse. Her excuse is she is always working constantly. Because she's a CEO. My father on the other hand has no excuse, I feel like he never spent any time with me. I have very certain memories from my time as a toddler. Nothing much just snippets or images here and there. But now that I'm thinking about it the only ones that I really have of my father are when he got mad at me for whatever it was I did as a dumb fucking toddler. And to this day whenever I try and spend time with him I can tell that he's trying to end it as soon as possible. And go back to whatever it was he was doing before. He never beat me physically, and I congratulate him for that. And all things considered he's not that bad and I could've had it way worse. A lot of people do. But I would be lying if I said he didn't play a part in my depression. The worst part is that I know if I make it to adulthood, and if I decide to have kids, I'm going to be way worse than he was. 

I feel like I can't tell anyone about my depression. One day at school we had a speaker come in to our class and talk to us about poetry. And how he found purpose in life through poetry and music. Our assignment for that day was to write a poem that started with the line ""when I write..."" I decided to take this opportunity to talk about my depression. And basically went on a two page poetic rant about basically all the bullshit that I'm writing about now. And how badly I wanted to kill myself. I turned it in, half expecting to get referred to the student councilor or a therapist of whatever the fuck. When I received the poem back with my grade the next day. I saw nothing but comment from my teacher along the lines of ""wow this is really great!"" or ""I'm speechless."" That was a huge slap in the face. I received no help whatsoever.

This post was a fucking long one so If you even read the entire thing thank you. I apologize if It go too angsty or emo. I just feel like I had to get all this shit off my chest and writing these sorts of things kind of helps"

Mew-Poke,depression,1620596311.0,Tired of giving unconditional love and kindness only to be hurt in the end,"I’m just so exhausted being the “kind, patient, and understanding” friend only to be shoved to the side as an afterthought. I guess it’s my fault for being too loving and people taking advantage of that.

I have a friend who moved across the country and has been struggling mentally and financially without any family or friend support there. And because she’s one of my (what I thought) best friends I’ve been there for her every single day since she’s moved there. Being supporting, caring, and trying to comfort the loneliness she was facing there. Even when I had a long exhausting days at work I would come home to FaceTime with her or play video games when she asked so she wouldn’t be sad.

I even spent $400 on flight tickets to visit her this month to make sure she’s doing mentally okay only for her to start ghosting me the past four weeks with no explanation. I’ve been so worried she hurt herself and tried to reach out to make sure she was alive and okay only to get no response or barely a sentence.

Found out recently she stopped talking to me over a girl she’s trying to date. It hurts so much because she couldn’t even tell me she just dropped our entire friendship and I had to find out through social media. I’ve always been so empathetic and understanding to my friends only for them to hurt me in the end. Maybe I keep befriending the wrong people or try to find the best in others, but god it hurts to be treated like this."

Yet this shitty dog runs away when anyone but my dad touches him and intentionally tries to piss everyone off. Yeah that's totally 100% better.

What pissed me off the most is when I mentioned that it had been 1 year since my cat died they all laughed and asked me why I still cared. I'm going to end up killing the shitty dog so I can laugh at them when they're crying.

Such a fucking waste of time and opportunity. I dont even know what to do anymore to feel atleast semi-okayish. I know I have to sit and get through my issues, set some tasks and goals.

I tried to quit drinking - but when I sober (like now) it becomes unbearable. ""Nothing is good"".

I wish I could say this was new but this is with anything. Anything I try the depression just seeps in and regulates my progress back.

I'm just thinking of my ex again. It sucks without you even though you ghosted 2 years ago I know your birthday is coming up. And you don't care how I felt about you.

It's so regular I know it would be draining to try and talk to people about it every time, so I've just stopped. But now the fact that I feel like I can't talk to anyone make me feel worse.

I don't have and cannot get/afford health insurance so I can't even talk to a doctor or a therapist.

To be honest, I want to kill myself. I'm so scared all the time, and I don't feel like I belong in this world. I feel like a mistake, and I can't stop feeling that way."

16liinesandimfine,depression,1620507162.0,"Suicidal, xanax, boyfriend finding out","So i told my boyfriend about my drug problem (Xanax) because that is honestly the only thing that helps with my Borderline Personality Disorder.

It makes me numb, careless and not a worry in  the world. I don´t care what happens to me or anyone in my surroundings. Finally a empty shell, which is such a relief. For the first time im not all over the place. Not as many suicidal thoughs, but sometimes they still appear.

So he spent the day with me today, and he kept track, so apparently i take 1mg about every 1.5 hours which adds upp to alot per day.

I don´t want to quit these pills since i´ve struggled with bpd and suicidal thoughts for years, and now it´s finally under control-

But he just got upset at me and said that if i do not stop taking them we can not continue the relationship.

SO eather me (a person with bpd so obviously super scared of losing someone) keep taking the pills and just be an empty shell with nobody in my life to love, or be loved by. 

Or i stop taking them and start self harming and thinking about suicide 10h a day.

And i´m ´´high´´ writing this post, because i got extremely anxious and im flooded with suicidal thoughts. 

So to sum this up, no matter what i do i´ll just end up dead.. Better to get it over with sooner rather than later i suppose."
Which-Holiday9957,depression,1620625045.0,I used to at least want to help people,"Maybe I just wasn’t depressed before. I feel like the last 8 years has been a slow decline in empathy and a surge in depression. 

I used to think I was an “empath” when I was younger and that the sadness I felt was connected to everyone else. The past few years especially I have noticed just how selfish I’ve gotten. Maybe it’s more jealousy than anything? 
But now it’s so hard to feel bad for anything and anyone because of the way I feel I guess. 
I feel like when I’m truly sad, not angry or jealous I feel way more depressed for the general state of everyone I see. 

But when I get angry I don’t care about anyone else or I have to force myself. Is that even part of depression or something else."

scatelo,depression,1620616032.0,Tips to deal with initial suicidal thoughts while adjusting to antidepressants?,"It's easy to find info about why some people experience an increase in suicidal thoughts while first adjusting to a new antidepressant, but not so much how to cope. Does anyone have any tips on how to get through it? 

I was previously on Prozac for a few months and had an increase in suicidal thoughts at the beginning stages and after I got off (I got off because the physical symptoms were too much, and I really didn't feel any better at all). It's been a few months and I'm still in the worst depression I have experienced thus far in my life, and my therapist recommended I try meds again so my doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I'm about to start taking it but am really scared that I will have an increase in suicidal thoughts while I adjust. I know it will likely pass/get better after a few weeks, but I'm not sure how much that knowledge will help me get through it. 

One thing that will be different is that I was mostly living alone (with minimal outside contact bc covid) when I was on Prozac, whereas I am now living with my mom - complicated relationship, but I think living alone did not help suicidal tendencies. I guess I'm looking for suggestions of that nature (but more easily done than a move haha) that I can do to push through any potential crises, or just generally if anyone has any experiences of a similar nature that they think might help. Thank you!"
just-another-mammal,depression,1620631744.0,Bought beer today,"I don't like the taste of alcohol, and have a sensitive stomach, which makes me buying beer have no logical value whatsoever.

If you look at my post history (yes I am self conscious, just like you) you can see that I am supposed to have spent my last dollars on drugs (I could of meant alcohol in the post I am talking about, but it wasn't) and no this isn't at all a covered post begging for money, I just like venting and posting to my own profile doesn't help in same the way.

Anyway, my mom sometime buys me those big water bottle that need you to have a water machine (is that how they are called in english?) and you can go to pretty much any convenience store and you get 10 bucks for the empty water bottle (the full one cost 5.99 more, and filling your empty one also cost 5.99) anyway, I was fully aware I didn't have that 6 bucks for a full water bottle and decided to buy a 6-pack of beer with the 10 bucks instead.  

I am currently urinating way too much, having watery stool and having a bloated stomach with no ""safe"" water supply to replace my lost fluids, which is entirely my fault and was a possibility I took into consideration buying beer instead of just water (you can still buy a decent amount of water with 10 bucks, just a LOT less than what is inside those big water bottle, 18 liters)

and I currently hate myself for having made this decision, I am not blaming anyone except me, I can admit there was a whole 30 minute I felt great because of the alcohol, which would not have happened with just water. Its just that I hate that somehow I chose that tiny timeframe where the pain will be eased knowing the pain will be worse than usual for the next day or two, hunger is manageable, thirst isn't, but I don't trust my tap water (even thought I will have to ""trust"" it eventually)

I don't like my life, no, I don't like *living*, I don't like myself, my decisions, my regrets after any bad decision knowing fully I knew about the regret I would have, I don't like that I live with about less than half what the poverty line is, even with higher education than most have (I live in canada if anyone is wondering at this point).

Where is the medical aid for dying to those in constant *psychological* pain? why do people still need a permanent *physically* painful illness to win the euthanasia lottery?

I wouldn't call myself an egoist, actually much more the opposite of that... but for example right now: Tomorrow, I was planning to get flowers for my mother for mother's day, and I just saw my mother in the kitchen packaging gifts for her mother and mother in law - actual gifts, I think fragrances (fragrances seem to be like the standard gift it seems...) [Due to corona related reasons I'm currently staying with my parents, and my both grandmothers are here too].

I instantly felt like a bad son, because I was ""only"" gonna get flowers for her... Now the shops are closed and I wanna get something more on monday. I could've bought something for her this whole week though...

I'll get to thr point. What I wanna say is that my circle of... well, all the things surrounding depression or that come with it, like... repeating routine of work, sleep and trying to/having to distract myself from the real world to just cope, that makes me forget about a lot of things, and puts my time management, general management of important things including appointment and stuff, any many many more things into a non-existent-state. It ends up so bad that I even forget important things about people around me that are important to me. Anf that's ahen I feel even worse... like a piece of shit. That stupid evil voice in my head tells me that I'm not a good human because I don't even care about them properly. I'm barely even managing to mentally support myself, I'm having real difficulties with this...

I imagine it would be even much worse if I had a lot of good friendships - good at least to the degree that you'd gift each other birthday presents. I would like to make everyone happy who means something to me and who I like, and if I was just fine I would certainly not restrain from spending time to think about what someone could like or what could make someone happy. It's just that... I can't hold it up. I'm constantly sinking and feeling bottom level down in this vicious circle of hell myself... I don't feel like I have the time to deal with things like this. And that's eyactly the point where I combat myself. That's the reason why I feel like shit. Because I actually do have the time, ""of course I have the time to think about what kind of present would be a happy little surprise to my mother, who I love, for mother's day, I would be a bad person if I didn't"", it's just that I can't and I beat myself up even more for it...

Spirited-Catch-2834,depression,1620547862.0,(23 F) I love the Superjail Warden/Mark Davis (47 M) but there's a very small chance we'd meet in person and it friggen hurts 😭,"So I'm prone to...being really in love with people to the point it clouds my judgement. There's this person (Mark Davis) (M, 47) I've been fixated on since around 2015. It's like when I saw him, there was this instant bond.

Ever since, it's like I HAVE to learn everything about him, even the most minute detail like his favorite color, what his medical history is, details about his job (Prison Warden) his political views, everything, sexual orientation, and they're quite similar to mine. When I found out what his full name was, I was literally giddy and in a daze for a couple days.

Just seeing the videos he's made makes me happy, I can be really stressed out or just feeling depressed, or anxious. But then he makes me feel better. I just love how dorky he is, I think he's absolutely adorable and he's always so lively..

I haven't met him in person yet, but I realllyyy hope to eventually. He isn't exactly a friendly person all of the time, he can be an asshole to people at times. I remember impulsively going full-hate mode on him when he said that he hated children. Then I snapped out of it..But I'm still attached to him and sometimes he even finds his way into my dreams then I get upset because it seems real.

He comes into my mind several times a day, like during dinner time I think, hmm I wonder what he's eating for dinner, or wondering when he's got home from work, when he'll be sleeping and then imagining him nice and comfy in bed. I wonder how he's doing right now.

I often wonder what he'd think of current events, or what answers he'd have to some questions I'd ask him.

I've repeatedly had these horrible nightmares where I'll dream that he died and I'd wake up literally sobbing, if he died I can't imagine how depressed I'd feel. Even now when I'm imagining him dying I literally feel physically sick to my stomach. I feel like if he died I'd have a nervous breakdown and I feel like crying right now just because I'm having to even bring that up. He's had no new videos since 2014 and I keep getting paranoid wondering if he's okay.

Problem is...I have no way of directly contacting him and I'm not even sure if he'd want me as a friend or not. I don't know what to do and I don't feel like I want to discuss this with a doctor because I'd seem crazy and stalker-ish. I sort of consider him as... a friend? Almost. I'm depressed and feel like if I met him in person and we spoke, I'd feel much better"

cinnamon9irl,depression,1620638610.0,how do i help my mum? tw: suicidal thoughts!!,"i need advice for how i can help my mum. 

some back story: my mum has dealt with abuse her whole life. she was abused by her parents, and then she dealt with abuse from my narsassistic dad, her ex partner. recently, she left him for the sake of my sister and i, because he was severely impacting our mental health. she has mentioned attempting suicide once before to me. it happened before she had me and my sister. 

we live in a small house now, and i think it has hurt her pride a lot. we were just cut off income support, she's unemployed and child support is barely enough for us to get by. yesterday was mothers day and she suddenly burst into tears, saying she had failed us and she was a bad example, and that everyone looked down on her. i've only seen my mother cry maybe 5, 6 times so it was really scary. 

today, she was talking to me about how she can't find a job. i told her not to give up, and that eventually she will find work again. she just has to stay strong. she says to me ""yeah, i guess i will. hopefully i find a job soon. or else i guess i'll just kill myself."" i know it sounds off handed but she has never said anything like that to me before, and she isn't the type of person to say something like that flippantly. i must have looked worried, she said soon after ""i take it back. of course i wouldn't kill myself. where would you two go? i can't leave you with your dad."" i can't really remember what else she said, but she said some more scary things.

she hasn't been herself lately. she's always angry, and complaining and i feel like i've been walking on eggshells trying to make her happy. it's also had a really bad effect on me. i feel everything she feels. i can't be happy unless she's happy. i am also dealing with suicidal thoughts. my reason for staying alive is pretty much the same as hers. i can picture how wrecked she would be if i did it, and thats what keeps me going. i don't know why i included that, but i guess i needed to let it out. 

sorry for the trauma dumping besties i really apologise, i just don't know what to do. i feel so lost. i've suggested therapy to her but she won't even consider it. i don't know how to help her.

In either case I'd love to hear feedback on how this is different from (or matches) your own experiences. 

---

In this final post of my check-in miniseries, I’ll begin delving into the topic that motivated me start writing: supporting people who are living with depression. First, I should add a disclaimer that’s surely obvious: kittenfarts.com is not a peer-reviewed psychiatric journal. Everything here is anecdotal; it’s based on the things I’ve learned over many years while trying and failing to navigate depression and the things I noticed when friends and family tried and failed to get through to me.

The tone here will be more serious than before. Supporting a friend or loved one who’s struggling with depression can feel like putting together a puzzle using the unprinted side. And worse, it’s too easy for our intentions and our words to be misread—or even vilified—by the effects of depression. Showing someone you care shouldn’t ever make things worse, but depression doesn’t answer to sensible assumptions. We’re going to have to understand what’s going wrong in order to be better than just sensible.

Let’s start by looking at a few of the symptoms of depression (major depressive disorder) listed by mayoclinic.org:

Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort
Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters
Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame
I don’t think I need to spend much time explaining why the first two items on that list make things difficult. If someone is feeling drained, or if they’re prone to anger, irritability, and frustration, the margin for error in a sensitive conversation is much smaller. Say one wrong word (or not enough of the right words) and the defensive walls will be raised. Despite that, I think it’s the final item on the list that we need to carefully work on. When someone is feeling worthless, when they’re feeling guilty or dealing with self-blame, it’s easy and natural for that person to assume the rest of the world sees them through that same judgmental lens. If we want to actually help, it’s critically important that we take the time to counter those feelings.

Why? Those feelings lead to or aggravate other symptoms and secondary emotions. And unlike with many of the more physical or chemical effects of depression, we can actually make a tangible difference. We can’t effectively counter most of the effects of depression for someone else. We can be loving and supportive. We can be good listeners. We can be there to help make the bad stuff more manageable, but most of that is just damage control. Please understand that I’m not claiming any of this is unimportant or not worth your time. The problem is our nurturing instinct wants us to do more—to show up with a wrench and torque the exact bolt that will fix someone. There’s no magic wrench you can wield that will cure depression for someone you care about. There are plenty of tools in the coping-with-depression toolbox, but bashing someone with their own tools won’t help them drive in a nail.

Alright, that all sounds pretty pessimistic. Didn’t I say something about making a tangible difference? I did, and I’ll repeat it. Take time to counter feelings of guilt, self-blame, low self-worth, etc. Most of us—depression or no depression—have a hyper-critical internal mirror. We don’t see the best version of ourselves; we may not even see a fair version of ourselves. With depression, it’s too easy to see through cat-poo-colored lenses. I’ll also assert that most of us don’t have an unbiased internal reference guide that says no, here’s the real, fair version of you. So what can we do? Be a mirror for the way you see someone. Show love, care, respect, admiration, or whatever it is the person inspires in you. Make it clear that being a part of their life is a joy and a blessing, not a burden or a curse. Say it with words and mean it. But also say it with your actions and with your body language.

I’m guessing the say it with words part is pretty clear, but I’d be happy to write more about that in another post—maybe I will! The say it with your actions and body language part is probably a lot harder to do. And it’s especially important with depression, because us clever depressed types are usually really good at empathy. If you’re sad because I’m sad, it’s probably making me even more sad. Did I say “sad” enough in that echo chamber? If that sounds like just a silly kitten-fart anecdote, here’s an article from the American Psychological Association: Empathy and depression: The moral system on overdrive.

So how do we mirror joy to someone who’s depressed without being condescending or patronizing? We do it earnestly and honestly. And importantly, we do it without sympathy. That may sound insensitive or cruel. Many of us respond to depression with sympathy because it seems like the kind, caring thing to do. But when we say something like “I’m so sorry you’re feeling sad” we’re confirming and enabling the negative, poo-colored lens stuff. From that little phrase, it’s too easy to hear “I’m so sorry. You really are a worthless failure and I can’t or won’t help you with that.” Congratulations, by trying to show someone you care you’ve made them feel worse.

Let’s talk about hugging for a moment. (I know, we’re in a pandemic. Who hugs these days?) I’d like you to visualize two scenarios where you might hug someone:

You’re at a funeral reception. Someone you care about has lost a loved one. You go in for a hug, and with every ounce of your strength you give a hug that says I’m so saddened by all of this but I’m here with you.

Hugging Scenario Two:

You’re at home, and you hear a knock at your door. You open up to find a friend with your favorite ice cream in hand. It’s exactly what you wanted and you didn’t even ask for it! Within seconds, you throw your arms around your friend, thinking “I’m so glad this person is part of my life!” And even if you don’t say those words, it’s clear you mean it with the most robust, vibrant hug you’ve given all day.

Why am I talking about hugging scenarios? Because we spend too much time responding to depression with the sentiment of scenario one, and not enough time with the sentiment of the ice cream hug. Let’s say this is check-in concept number four:

Be clear about the intent of your check-in.

Be vulnerable.

Use language that prompts narrative, not judgement.

Mirror love. Mirror Joy.

I’d love to say that this will always work. It won’t. I’d like to say this will sometimes help. It might. Or you might find that it feels like nothing helps. Now we have to get to the last part of this post title. Don’t give up. If you’re not getting through, try other things, or have a conversation about how you can best be supportive. Alternatively, you might be helpful and/or appreciated and you’re just not getting affirmation/feedback. I’m being short on advice here because this topic deserves its own book. I may not write the book, but I will spend more time on this part in the future! In any case, keep trying for as long as you’re willing, or at least for as long as someone will let you in. Your presence, love, and joy are meaningful and important whether or not you see it.

So what’s next? At some point I’ll need to do some difficult contemplation on what we can possibly do when someone won’t let us in. For now, I’d like to spend more time on the stuff that doesn’t feel impossible. I’m not sure where that’ll bring me next, but I’m sure it’ll come to me like a kitten fart in the wind. In the meantime, please enjoy a presentation by Dr. Brené Brown on sympathy and empathy. I discovered this a few years ago, and it’s still important today in shaping my understanding of the power of empathy.

tuesdaypower,depression,1620615087.0,Weaning off 50mg sertraline,"So been on sertraline for about 4 months now and wanted to quit. Don't wanna go full turkey so this week going to take 25mg doses and then take that every other day and then stop. 

I've taken sertraline years ago for a shorter amount of time and remember going cold turkey (because I'm dumb lol). But had no withdrawal effects except one night I had a few brain zaps which was scary as hell. However I remember that the symptoms I got this time for first taking sertraline was much worse in comparison to when I did it years ago. So I was wondering if your symptoms at the beginning are bad, is that a clue that the withdrawal symptoms coming off them with also be bad? 

Also do you think my plan coming off them is a good idea (with taking the 25mg first)?"

I heard again and again that denying or pretending is unrecommended to release stress or overthinking.

And yet I won't kill myself. But I crave so badly to die I just want to cease to exist I have no place here. I'm reaching the end of my rope and not seeing a light.

sadcatmommy3,depression,1620600042.0,Hopeless,"I think the title sums it up. I’ve had dysthymia for probable twenty years at this point (diagnosed ten years ago). I go through the motions of life, even received a graduate degree while still functionally depressed. But life isn’t very pleasant.

I’m not going to commit suicide but if I caught a terminal disease I’d likely shrug. Life just seems harder for me than the people around me. I have to psyche myself every morning to get out of bed, but I rarely miss work. I get on a good role for a few days or a week then my mood flatlines. And it’s back to square one.

My doctor put in a referral to see a psychiatrist more than a year ago. They offered me a few counselling sessions and then covid happened. I’ve been privately paying for a Counsellor for six months now. I have been seeing Counsellors on and off for fifteen years and haven’t made much improvement. But I get up and go to work most every day. I want to see a psychiatrist rather than another Counsellor, but I can’t make anyone take me seriously.

I have no hope that life will get better. I haven’t had enough energy to date in fifteen years. I don’t own a home of my one because I’ve had interruptions on my employment due to bad years and I’m a single mom to a nearly adult/live in an expensive place.

Basically I’ve reached my forties without hitting most life goals. And I have had a hedonic for decades which makes life itself a chore.

Thanks for listening to my whine."

I don't know why. It just makes me anxious and depressed to the point where I can't function anymore. Just really odd. Just heard the ice cream car drive by and for some reason that triggers it even more. It's weird becausw the summer tends to trigger it more than say cold, dark winter days.

verumleonhart,depression,1620480940.0,I'm disabled and my mom treats me like a slave,"I have mild cerebral palsy, adhd and asthma but my mom still expects to do all this heavy lifting. She's throwing a party and I had to cut the front and back. When I offered to pony up the cash for someone to do all that herself she snapped on me. So when I asked her to rake a few of the leaves while I took a rest she made an attempt but grew frustrated and said she's moving the party to the front. She's disabled too but she keeps doing things that goes against that and keeps saying if she can work through it so can I.

Another thing she does is call my name every five minutes for things any modern adult should know like sending emails or logging in her FB. Apparently she can't memorize her gmail and password despite me writing them on paper and saving them on her phone.

She also  expects me to be her therapists because she has bad friends who constantly stab her in the back. As well as my dad who she's separated with but keeps hanging out with yet disrespect her all the time.

I'm 27 and I would move out but I'm on ssi and I have nowhere else to go. I pay my portion of the rent, I pay most of the cable bill, I buy my own food & clean after myself but she still wont leave me be!

Bit_Cop,depression,1620595766.0,Today was the closest I've come to ending it.,"Never thought I'd make a second post here, but oh well.

20[M], and earlier this day was the closest I've come to actually going through with killing myself. I'll be honest and say it was a weird feeling; as there wasn't anything that really brought in on.

Sure I saw that my friends were out together again without me which is always a bummer, but I've been seeing that for months, among other shitty things during this whole pandemic. Yet today of all days as I sat on my bed and scrolled through my phone, I just decided:

""Yeah, I suppose that's it."" Got the knife, got the note I've already wrote out put beside me and kinda just sat down ready to do it. Obviously since I'm typing this, I didn't go through with it - a mixture of not wanting my mom to come back home to a dead kid, and just generally me being a bitch, meant in the end I just put everything away.

But knowing how close I was, it's a strange feeling. Even now I just kinda feel . . . Empty? I thought I'd be scared, fuck even anger would be justified, but this hollow feeling is what I'm drifting off to tonight.

So yeah, that's my story. Don't know the exact purpose of this post, to be honest I might delete it - but my therapist said typing things down could help."

mmkzero3,depression,1620582919.0,"A lot of shit happens to us, we should not be too hard to ourselves.","Today was a day of reminiscing aboutold times and how fucked up life is and how fucked up my own life in this world is. I do not want to get into detail because we all have our problems we have to face on a daily basis. I just came to 2 conclusions today, which do not make sense when comparing them, but it shows how versatile depression can be and why non-depressed people never get a grasp of what depression really is:


1. You can hate yourself up to the point where this self hatred actually makes you happy. Just think about it. If you confront yourself in the worst possible way it can either lead to this hate being converted to happiness or it gets deeper into your flesh. Telling yourself that you are shit is different from just thinking about it.


2. Life is made out of sub-categories every human wants to fulfill, and we do not care how we will achieve them. Also, a drug itself is not harmful as long as it does not replace anything in your life. A criminal will point his gun to your head, because this is the moment where he actually gets the most attention from a person. It is the feeling we crave, not the actual tool we make use of to reach that goal.

I had many more thoughts built up for today , but I guess this is enough."

I asked if he was ok, he said he was. I know he was lying so I said « hmm.. are you sure? » and he literally told me « can you stop asking questions »...  

Last time he said that he had tears in his eyes and he started to try and make me laugh just so we could change topics.  

Idk what to say/do. I am exhausted... He broke up with me after 5 years together because of his diagnosis. He has been pretty depressed as well. I started going to the diabetic center to talk to my dad’s friend (who’s an endocrinologist) and he has been so helpful. I even started reading lots of books and well, pretty much educate myself since my dude has never wanted to fully share what was up. He says it’s to protect me because « he knows he could ruin my life one way or another ». We agreed to stay friends since we love each other way too much to just let go.

Lately we’ve been communicating a little bit. He initiated flirting and sexting and well.. it’s been a roller coaster with him and I’m fine. I mean when everything gets shitty you gotta support those you love, right ? But today idk, his « can you stop asking questions » made me feel rejected and pushed away to the point where I don’t know if I’m allowed to be in his life anymore.

Frequent-Size994,depression,1620538017.0,Taking a Chance is Bringing Light Back Into my Life,"I was born into trauma. For the first six years of my life I had a difficult to diagnose medical condition that caused pain to radiate through my entire body, movements, body position or even loud noise would amplify this greatly.

I was molested when I was a child on numerous occasions by more than one person.

I was the target of bullies in school.

My mother was psychologically abusive to me as a child and still has her moments.

As an early teenager, the bullying mostly stopped as I grew to be larger than most. However, my happiness was quickly crushed when my mother told me that her and my father were getting divorced and that it was my fault. The psychological abuse became significantly worse without my father there to control any of her output. 

I was told the following things and many more during that time:

""You need to lie about who you are if you want any girl to like you, it'll be hard for you to keep it up.""

""We need to make a plan for you since you'll never be able to graduate high school""(I received excellent grades and graduated easily)

""I hope you don't have a small dick like your father.""

""Open the door, I'm having a heart attack, if you open the door then it will stop.""

""If you don't open the door, I'll call the police and tell them you hit me. Who do you think they'll believe, you or me?""

""Why can't you just be normal?""

""I'm really concerned you're talking to yourself and not real people!"" (While I was voice chatting with friends on Skype)

I moved in with my dad when I was around 18. Things improved drastically. When I would go to see my mother she would tell me that my mental health was declining rapidly and that she was strongly considering having me made a ward of the state. She would tell me that I should move back in with her, I certainly wasn't falling for that.

I did well in college and graduated with a degree in software development. Shortly after this I met a woman who was just like my mother but I couldn't see it. We got married in less than 6 months and she became horribly abusive after that. I couldn't force myself to leave. I was so busy working a job I had when I was in college plus another job that I had no time to pursue a job as a software dev. Once she managed to drain all of my money, she got in with the wrong crowd and began working as an escort. I had zero idea she was doing that. Fast forward, I finally get the courage to break things off with her and kick her out. I decide my best course of action to get over her was to find a woman to sleep with on Tinder. There I found  her profile, selling herself. Initially, I thought this was done to scorn me in some way and not the truth. I check other sites known for women doing that and found her posting. I contacted a friend that she had a falling out with and the friend directs me to far more media where she's advertising. 

This left me absolutely devastated. The weight of everything before that and then that rendered me unable to give a fuck about much of anything. Shortly there after I went through bankruptcy and divorce in the same month. That made things even worse. The period when I was just living with my mother was dark but I was able to overcome it. This has left me in a deep state of depression for quite a while. 

I've been trying for a few years to get over my past or at least build my skills and portfolio as a software dev to get a job I don't absolutely hate. The job I'm working at now makes me absolutely miserable. I've got some money saved up and have decided to quit that job at the end of this month. I can't take any more of it. The decision to do that has brought some happiness back to my life. I'm starting to feel a bit like myself during college. Enthusiasm and passion are starting to make small appearances. I hate to take the leap but, I feel that if I don't things are only going to keep getting worse. It's been getting easier to get out of bed since I've made the decision."
watchingTheStormGoBy,depression,1620590557.0,Mother's Day without my mom,"I lost my mom to cancer a few years ago.  She was incredibly close to me, my wife, and kids.  I still observe the holiday for the sake of my wife and kids but it's so damn hard to get into it, or plan for it, or make the day extra special for my wife.  We still got her a card, flowers, and a thoughtful gift.  We cooked her favorite brunch, and don't expect her to do anything she doesn't want to.   She said it was more than enough, but it's not nearly the celebration we used to have.  I feel really depressed today.  My mom was way too young to die (62). I kinda want to go to the cemetery but I hate cemeteries.   Also it's cold and rainy where I live.  I also don't like to cry.  I wish I could get on with my day and do the things I have to do, but I feel glued to my chair.

I didn’t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore.

realsadhoursalt,depression,1620645746.0,Lost,"16 and completely lost with purpose. Up until really recently i had plenty purpose, and i only kept gathering and gaining motivation as time went on and things got better. But, idk what exactly happened, but its all fallen down the drain. I have friends who care about me and who are honestly extremely fun, im not bad looking, im bright, im on the trajectory to success, i have a hobby which i enjoy a lot, parents who care a lot, a family which is great to be around. But, even with all this, and all these good things, I havent a true purpose. I do pursue all these things, not because i expect something, but because i naturally do. 

This is where the issue with purpose comes in. I have been told plenty that life is short and i should make the best of it. But i cant seem to accept that, i cannot accept the fact of my death, and the fact that whatever i do it will absolutely not matter.

I will live a life, great! But i will die, not so great. But the things i do in my life will affect those around me and if i have a large enough influence even the world, great! But eventually society will crumble and this planet and solar system will die, not so great. But maybe we will travel out of the solar system, and by the smallest of hairs maybe i will have development into that area and will possibly be recognized in that and remembered, great! but eventually the universe will die, not so great. But, but what? There is nothing after that. Eventually after that everything will die out, and i just dont see a purpose in going forward. Most people wont chase making a mark and just wanna be happy. 

My issue with happiness is trying to accept the fact im just chemicals interacting, and the things that drive all positive emotion within my body is seratonin and dopamine, two depressingly simple chemicals driving all the motivation and purpose in my life. In a sense, i am just molecules moving in complex manners, passing electrons back and forth in chemical reactions, i am alive but in a sense lifelessly simple. My very being is not special. And for me to chase happiness is chase the excitation and activity of 1 or 2 molecules. 

So, i dont see a purpose in trying to make a mark, and dont see a purpose in trying to be happy. Since all seem meaningless to me. And this entire mix of pointlessness creates something like this:

I dont care about having a job, sure itll feel good to have a career and make money but it wont matter.

Im good looking but why does that really matter, im going to die and maybe if that gets me a chance to have a loving relationship and have kids, it wont matter in the end because nothing will exist in the end.

Im bright, but that simply doesnt matter since nothing will come to exist eventually, making such a gift, entirely pointless.

Im on the trajectory to success at my current rate, but that simply wont matter because i will die and my marks on this universe will either fade, or seize to exist as time passes and the universe dies.

I have a hobby which i enjoy, but that enjoyment wont mean anything when im dead, and if it develops into something that contributes to society, it literally wont matter because eventually everything will fade away and seize to exist, and all my contributions will die with it.

&#x200B;

The only things im unable to really toss away is my parents, friends, and absolute love. If i threw all this away i would genuinely probably not be functional at this moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You might ask why i am still alive or functional or i keep going, it isnt because i found something to keep going toward, or something that gives me hope, its because i just keep forgetting about all this, and fall back to an idle state of existing in the moment and not thinking about the future. I dont like it and it just feels like a mindless cope against my fate of death and meaninglessness, but whatever.

And before anyone comments how my life is great and how i dont deserve it if i feel this way, or i should use it to the best of my abilities because its a life most people arent blessed with. The mental illness and hyperawareness of this bodies fate would also come with it, so in a sense, im not as blessed as i think. And if i could have never been born and let someone else have this than i would have, i really do wish i was never born. If i was being consistent than i would have said ""i dont care if i was born or not"", but i kinda wish i wasnt born because i have human emotions and i guess they decided this."

kjnthrowaway,depression,1620432994.0,I don't know how to live for myself,"My four best friends are my greatest reason for being alive. They’ve been my only support system through years of hardship and depression. But lately, that’s been less of a good thing; I don’t think I have any other reason to be alive anymore. Most days, I spend a lot of energy wondering if they hate me, if I’m a burden to them, etc. We used to hang out every day or go on Discord every night, but life has made us all too busy for that. I’m unable to distract myself from the void that’s been left behind.

Without going too into detail, I’ve gone through a lot of things I struggle to move on from. Things like old best friends committing suicide, being falsely accused of rape, being raped myself. I grew to live by the philosophy of “there’s no such thing as a bad reason to live”. I hung onto the words of those four: sometimes, the wisdom they gave, and sometimes just the warmth of their company. I wouldn’t say their words were ever useless, because they did make me a stronger person. But when life gets unbearable, I depend on them a lot.

I can’t focus on anything but these thoughts right now. I should be happy for my friends living fulfilling lives, but my loneliness is too distracting. I want to be better for all of our sake, but the days are long. I have no idea how to live for myself; even when I do something simple like read a book, my brain is filled with thoughts of “you’re only doing this because nobody wants you”. I feel like I’m pushing them away, which is driving me crazy, even though I should be at peace even if they all hated me.

I stopped talking about myself to anyone other than my husband. I am struggling but I can't even tell about it to my mum or best friend. I can't fall asleep and once I am asleep, I can't wake up. I stopped exercising completely. I check my phone and email 100s of times a day, always expecting bad news. I tell my self that I hate myself (sometimes out loud) at least 100 times a day. When I am driving alone, I start screaming my head off to calm myself down. I don't feel worthy of anyone's time or love. I don't feel worthy of anything. I am not okay. I developed a fear of choking and have a hard time swallowing my food. I used to be a fast eater and now it takes me almost an hour to eat a meal because I struggle with every bite. I am not okay. I need someone to tell me that this will pass. I am not okay."

I feel selfish and guilty for not being strong enough. I was always the strong one now I'm the failure. I'm at the lowest I've ever been. None of my original coping mechanisms are working. I've completely isolated myself from everyone. My own family is showing signs of growing frustration and annoyance with me. The only person I had, I pushed away because of my toxic behavior, my jealousy of how healthy and financially secure they were, and how our relationship felt like I was completely alone. They are so healthy and happy while I'm mess. Everytime I was around them I felt like I was sucking all the oxygen out of the room. I tried to be open with them but I knew they didn't know how to support me and I knew it was unfair to expect that. I know they are better off without me. I'm at my breaking point. Drinking too much, sleeping too much, eating too much. Everyday is a repeat of the day before, which makes me lose track of days and time. I guess no one cares and so I guess I don't care either anymore. I guess I'll just keep pretending.

It reminded me of a conversation I had with a guy I game with where he said, ""I noticed that I didn't feel like my normal self.""  That got me to thinking what my ""normal self"" actually is.  It's been so many years now; I just don't know.  I don't remember what it felt like to just be happy for a whole week or even just a whole day.  I realized all I have are blips of happiness, maybe longer lasting contentment, then the morose nothingness of indifference.  

It's hard to consider therapy at this point I feel.  I imagine I'd just be wasting time a doctor could spend helping someone actually seeking to get better.  It would be neat to be a clinical study maybe.  I feel I might make an interesting patient to the inquisitive mind.  Narcissistic, I know...  Still.  We all want to think of ourselves as unique and special.

boldbenji,depression,1620507881.0,1.5 years of therapy and nothing has changed.,"I (f28) have been in therapy for almost one and a half year now. My therapist is going to move away in July so I only have a few sessions left (I see him once a week). I had problems opening up to him the whole time even though I like him and we get along well, I'm just not good at expressing my feelings and talking about myself. Last week he told me that he has the feeling that ever since he told me he's leaving in summer I'm getting more distant and that's probably true because what's the point of still going there anyway? I don't feel better at all since starting therapy. Nothing has changed. I still don't enjoy living my life and I feel like I don't make progress at all. I still think about suicide a lot and in the beginning I hoped that at least that would change. If therapy does not work for me then what will? 

I'm suffering from depression for over 10 years now. I did therapy, I was in mental institutions multiple times. Still fighting this battle after all this time makes no sense at all if I'm not going to feel better anyways. Maybe someone feels similar about therapy or want to share their experience about getting better after years of therapy? 

This all sounds more hopeless than I intended it to be. What keeps me going is taking care of my chocolate lab. He's my best friend and I have no idea what I would do without him.

I guess what made me write this is that I’ve read countless “unpopular opinions” about how Billie Eilish is overrated because she writes depressing music to be trendy and that she’s only “fake depressed”. Little do they know, she’s talked about how she used to self harm in bathrooms and has had suicidal thoughts. 

I do think it’s become fairly popular nowadays to “gate-keep” depression. Now you have to prove you’re actually depressed in order for people to initiate you into this depression club they’ve formed. If you smile a few times with your friends or take social pics for Instagram, those gatekeepers think it’s impossible for you to be depressed. You make one dark-humored joke about having depression, they’ll say you’re only doing it because it’s trendy; not because you’re actually depressed. 

Gate-keeping depression is weird. ANYONE can be depressed and even suicidal. Rich or poor. Conventionally attractive or not. In a committed relationship or not. That person you see who’s bubbly in person could be putting up a facade so you can’t see just how broken, damaged, and helpless they feel internally.

Gate-keeping depression does way more harm than good(if there’s any good at all) because what if that person who’s in serious need of help decides to attempt suicide—not to actually die but solely to be taken serious and to avoid people saying they’re seeking attention."

my dad came into my room a few days ago, asking if we can talk.. he said i might get some of this mental ilness from him, because he also feels far away from reality, and his mother was also a bit ‘cookoo’ (they lived in communism so getting professional help wasn’t an option). From what i understood, he is depressed. he also told me he’s had some suicidal thoughts and ideas, but that too many people rely on him, or something along those lines, basically that he would do it if so many people wouldn’t suffer if he did it. then he said he hopes i won’t hurt myself, because he wouldn’t be able to live with it. he also told me he might want to go see my psychiatrist, so maybe ‘she can give him something to make him feel better’. this whole conversation absolutely blew my mind because he’s such an introvert, he doesn’t talk much, especially when it comes to his emotions. We’ve had a pretty close relationship, and we get along really well, although the lack of communication can be felt. 

what the hell do i do now? he’s away with my mom for the weekend at the sea, so he said to not talk to my psychiatrist yet, because maybe he’ll feel better after the sea, but i doubt it, since he’s been like this for a long time. he doesn’t leave his desk (since he works from home, he has his own company). and he hasn’t been smiling much lately. i genuinely don’t know what to do.

i’m trying to be there for him, to support him, to see how his day went and offer comfort. but what if he’s thoughts don’t go away? what if i lose him? what then?

how can i help him? 

PS: my grandma told me (without his consent) that he’s attempted suicide once before, when he was in his 20s... we always took his silent personality as simple introversion, but i’m thinking it’s much much more.

Commercial_Speaker_4,depression,1620563508.0,How to overcome low self-esteem?,"Hi all,

I just wanted to ask has anyone ever overcome quite severely low self esteem? 

I have always tended towards low self esteem but it is ruining my life now. 

I am very lucky as I have a very supportive partner but it has been a struggle!

I am currently taking anti depressants and going through counselling and although my physical symptoms of depression have improved I still feel like human trash 4 months down the line.

I have tried taking up new hobbies, writing down positive things, I exercise every day but I cant help but feel like all that I (and multiple health professionals) are doing is trying to inject some kind of false importance in to my life ? 

I have had a fair share of trauma which I think unfortunately has ruined my life ? Eight years ago something very unplesant and traumatic happened to me, causing me to have a psychotic episode and subsequently develop PTSD. I had to move universities and completely rebuild my life which I still feel like I am recovering from in a way. 

I am currently off work with stress. A few months ago I was misdiagnosed at the medical centre I work at which has lead to long term health issues. I have tried to relocate workplaces but was told this would be impossible. Subsequently, I did not put in a complaint about my care as I felt if I had to deal with this too, I would no longer be able to function. Before this, I suspect I was burnt out which did not help- I was often coming in an hour early and leaving 2-3 hours late with no lunch during the pandemic. Understandably, morale was low which caused me to get in to heated conversations with colleagues when I would usually be able to keep my head (someone calling me a ""silly woman"" ""irish and therefore stupid"" etc) so I now feel ashamed of that as well and like it is impossible to go back!! 

I have tried looking at another job to do which would be less intense, but I dont feel confident to undergo an interview process etc. As I am a human dumspter fire.

Even when I meet with friends I feel I cant look them in the eye as I just feel so ashamed at what a disappointment I am. 

I have no peace or rest and I can't hide it from my partner any more. Even though in the past I have felt negatively, I would often try to speak positively and spin a positive narrative but it hasn't changed my thinking. I just hate myself so much and I don't know who I am trying to fool at this stage.

I know I am lucky and have more than most,  but I feel as though I am like some rescue dog who has to spend their life convalescing in a quiet place because their prior experience has ruined them. What has it all been for ?  Maybe I deserve to feel like pond sludge. 

Has anyone overcome something like this and felt they could just live their life/ do what they want rather than hide away?

So - cutting to the point here - ***how do I fix that?***

Some personal information and factors:

* I don't currently see a mental health specialist of any kind (trying to atm, but I've never been able to open up to them before)
* Even if I get to the point of doing something, I am so easily distracted by other things I can/need to do, even if it's far less important
* Adding onto that - when I am actually doing it, I can't focus on it completely. It's not even the distractions, it's like my brain can't process anything and I'm left with a bunch of words that I have to read over and over again before they even begin to make sense.
* In high school, so I have to study. I'm also trying to write stories (creative writing, which I'm genuinely good at), along with learning another language (or two...). I haven't even started the assessment task that was due over a week ago. I had a month to do it.
* It's gotten so bad (the motivation) that I don't practise any basic hygiene. I shower about once a week and brush my teeth only before I go to school. That's it.
* Also, I skip a lot of school, (80% attendance rate, not that bad, but not good either, scared it'll get worse)

&#x200B;

So the main things I want to focus on doing everyday are:

* Studying and doing homework
* Learning another language
* The creative writing
* Basic hygiene
* General willpower to do things because I want to or I need to (doesn't matter how much I want to do something, usually the choice of not moving surpasses it)

&#x200B;

*If any of you have any personal stories, tips, solutions, guidance, whatever! Please, please, please help a fellow depression-ridiculed person out! <3*"
DaddyDankMemes420,depression,1620626912.0,Why is it that life has a way of kicking you when you're already down?,"24 years old here and within the past 3 months, my depression has gotten to its darkest point in my life. These days, I feel a lot of self hate, numbness and jaded towards life in general and ""the way things are"". 

These feelings are hard to cope with, I find myself not wanting to go to work and just wanting to sleep. If I'm having a good day, I can convince myself to do something I enjoy. But that's about all I'm doing for that day. Once I'm finished, I'm done with everything else for the day.

Anyway, all of these feelings are enough to deal with on their own, but when things seem to be at their worst, life always comes in to kick me while I'm already down.
Just this past week, I overdrafted in the bank, 2 tires went bad on my car. One has a leak and the other a broken belt. I'm nearly out of gas and still have to get to work, I owe money to a cash advance place, I only got 14 hours scheduled at work this past week so I'll have like no money to money to pay for all this out of my next check. As if this all wasn't enough, my fiance texts me today that our microwave broke. All of this came at the worst possible time. We're trying to save for a wedding. My fiance has bad anxiety when it comes to money and I just feel like a failure and a burden.

I can't even pay to keep my car running or the household finances in check, let alone pay for a wedding or support a family. All of this with my depression just solidifies my insecurities of being a failure at life. For a good half hour today, I felt like I was really going to kill myself over a microwave.

I don't know, life just feels like too much anymore. My depression has gotten too severe for me to deal with and the universe just doesn't seem to have me in its favor. I don't know what to do for myself or what's going to make me feel like I used to."
a24chadduog-,depression,1620552435.0,End Of The Road,"
I'm 39 and I've always dealt with massive depression. My coping mechanism was always exercise and I'm to broke to own a car so I'd bike commute everywhere. Unfortunately five years ago I was in a bike accident the result of which made sex impossible. At the time I was in love and in a new relationship but that was cut short. I dealt with the deep depression and suicidal ideation from that and just barley resigned myself to a life alone without relationships.the loneliness was sometimes unbearable but I kept myself busy with other things tried to find other focuses in life. I unfortunately have no college degree and a just slightly above minimum wage job so my career is non-existent. 

A month ago I injured myself lifting an I now have a hiatal hernia that's reduced my already low quality of life to zero. The hiatal hernia pushes the stomach through the esophagus and I'm basically spewing acid all day long. It's bad enough that they want to perform surgery but the operation is a nightmare and everywhere I look the outcomes are not great. Life limiting in either direction. High probability of permanent constipation. I have to sleep propped up on a special pillow or else I'm in severe pain all night. Food was one of few joys for me and now I can't eat anything but the most bland foods at very specific times. Even the prescription antacids I'm on don't help. I've decided this is no way to live. Even if by some miracle the surgery isn't botched, I'm severely limited to what I can do in life. I suppose I'm a coward in some way, but I can't bear it any longer. If anything this has just forced something I've thought of many times before. In the past, suicidal ideation could be somewhat of a comfort during hard times, but it feels very different now that it's real for me. Now that I can't even lay down on my back without excruciating pain and internal damage.

I've spent long hours researching the best least painful options for me, most feel very gruesome. Obviously. I thought about hanging myself several times but I don't think I could do it without messing up. Instead I've decided I'm going to take a bunch of mushrooms, go down to the ocean early in the morning while it's still cold, wade out with a life jacket so I can drift off and let hypothermia take me without the panic of drowning. If it was still winter I'd go up into the mountains and do the same. I have nothing and no one and rather this than squeaking out an even more painful physical existence for next decade or so."

TheKATinthehat_,depression,1620428545.0,An overdose of uncomfortable,"
I feel bound by an inevitable state of uncomfortability. The feeling of an unknown that is eating me up and I can’t stand it. 
This feeling is a lot like being forced to sit in the dark when you are deathly afraid of both- it and all that is imagined to lurk among it. 
Or like being forced to co-exist with the spider you saw in your room because you’ve lost sight of it even though you are physically and mentally itching to leave every second you are stuck there. 
For me, that is the feeling of being awake. I am constantly itching, every second, to escape my body. My reality. I can’t sleep.  I can’t eat. I can’t breathe. I can’t sit still.  No good movie, walk, talk, or song is able to keep me from feeling that need to escape me. I am constantly restless with nothing to distract me because the distractions are merely just that. Distractions. Something to keep me occupied for a few seconds or minutes while the uncomfortability peeps over my shoulder, never leaving. As If we are attached at the hip.

I am kinda a heavy weed smoker and it had been making me feel a lot better, and now I was able to experience emotion at a healthy amount. I had been doing fine ever since I started going to college and so I assumed the bulk of the problem was high school, but this past weekend I’ve been having suicidal ideation out of nowhere and I’ve just felt so lonely and so empty and just crying in bouts nonstop. I hate that the only solution is to stop smoking and to start just taking my meds because this is going to be a long process and it’s finals week and this whole situation is so dumb. I’m to embarrassed to even talk about this to my friends or my parents, i hate to feel so alone and so so goddamn dumb at the same time. Has anyone been in the same boat?  Does anyone have any help for how to get through this process and stop my utterly idiotic cycle?"

spicydevilchicken,depression,1620581012.0,I don’t like where I am in life and my mum admitted she's unhappy and lonely.,"Throughout my childhood I thought by the time I'm 27, I would have moved out of home, have a boyfriend, have a job and have some sort of life. Then when my depression got worse I didn't see myself living past 30 years old. 
I am not happy where I am in life, I am 27 and I still live at home, I can't get a job even when I've applied to so many places. I am overweight and can't seem to lose it and I have a boyfriend who I amazing but I can't stop putting doubts in my mind. 

I just don't really want to live like this anymore or live at all. I don't want to die because I am leaving behind too many responsibilities like my dog and my birds. 

I am sick of being sick!!! Why can't I just have a normal brain instead of one that doesn't want to live? 

I haven't talked to my dad in 3 weeks and today on mothers day, my mum cried and said she's lonely. My dad is being a dick to her and she can't talk to my brother or sister and she talks to me. But she said that I sometimes don't want to listen and then she has no one to talk to. I told her it's not fair that she's putting it all on me. She needs to talk to my dad about his behaviour or talk to a therapist. She doesn't want to listen to that. She said she's lonely and unhappy.
I don't know what to do about this. I already feel guilty that I will leave her if I do ever move out. 

But I can't stay here, my dad made my depression worse when we had our fight to the point of me cutting myself. 
I haven't self harmed in years too. I just couldn't stop my thoughts and I wanted to hurt myself.

Does anyone else feel this way?"
PrinceHal9000,depression,1620486935.0,Primer,"My best attempt to describe it is: An anhedonic state brought about by a feeling that all potential actions are hopeless and futile. Maybe that sounds like *hopelessness*, but *hopelessness* evokes an image of a haunted person shaking with despair. That is not me. I am still. 

I am a human body lying on a mass-produced, cheap imitation of a midcentury couch. I am a human body staring at the tenth generation of a smartphone. I am a human body updating the New York Times newsfeed for the 57th time in a day. I am a human body refreshing a YouTube feed even though all the interesting videos have already been watched. I am a human body checking Instagram even though nothing of interest is happening.  I am a human body feeling that time is slipping away, unable to summon the will to do something productive. 

The cycle repeats: NYTimes, YouTube, Instagram.

Mindlessly, nothing changes. 

When I first bought that couch, I absolutely loved it.

Is my experience specific to this period of human existence (early 2020s America emerging from what we are calling “the pandemic”), or is it something more fundamentally human, experienced by others in every period? Is it brought on by having too much time to think, not enough distraction by work? Is it a response to a world that I am experiencing through the wildly distorted lenses of the various media I frequent, media that seems insidiously designed to make me feel disturbed enough to click on the headline/advertisement? Is it masking the frustration I feel at my incompetence to attack the greatest challenges of my life which are always lurking, ready to spring to conscious thought at any moment? 

I check the NYTimes again.

I am distracted. The red robin in the green spring through my window is also growing weary of the chainsaw gut renovation taking place at the neighbor’s house. 

I have a lovely home. I built a business. I am more successful than I could have ever imagined. The NYTimes hates me. I am a member of the category to blame for everything.

How do I get off this couch? What quantum fluctuation within the endlessly-exstensible systems of my brain will result in a state-change to run the DoThis(string action) method? It will come. It always does. No one stays on the couch forever.

I bought a book: The Oxford Handbook of Human Motivation. I have not read it.

I put down the phone. I meditate.

A light.

A wave.

A voice.

A realization.

I am no one. Who I was is gone. I threw him into the volcano years ago when I started building the business. It was the only way to survive the 120 hour work weeks. It was the only way to survive the endless, brutal negotiations. It was the only way to separate myself from the misplaced dreams of my youth. It was the only way to handle the grief of a failed marriage that was entirely my fault. Be the character: The Leader. Sacrifice the self for the good of the whole. Steer the ship through turbulent waters while the disease (or whatever) eats you from the inside out. Have a drink. Never let go of the wheel.

I stare at my phone. The NYTimes tells me I haven’t paid my fair share.

It’s long past time to buy a new phone.

So what now?

The Leader has served me well. He did his job. He will continue to do so. I can’t kill him. I need him. The mortgage must be paid. Hundreds of people depend on him to keep things rolling along so they can buy their houses, get married, have kids, and keep the whole cycle going. The Leader can’t go anywhere.

But (wait one minute). 

What if there is a way?

Transparency through anonymity.

Truth through obfuscation of the self.

Escape the Human Zoo.

Continue the cycle of reality by creating its propagator.

Jesus Christ, it’s going to be a lot of work.

I have a mission. I have hope. I know what I must build. I know how to do it.

I can see each of the steps perfectly laid out before me. They have always been there. I thought I saw them in the past, but I could only make it a few steps before I stepped out into space and missed completely, expecting to feel that awful feeling of transitioning to an unanticipated freefalling state, but instead feeling nothing at all and simply landing flat on a cheap imitation of a midcentury couch.

I should buy a new couch.

But not now.

Take the first step.

Get off the couch.

Look behind you.

There is a circuitous road that is well-worn from the steps I have taken, leading to this point of my approaching-middle-age life at the dawn of post-pandemic America."

Bai_Ruoyan,depression,1620466920.0,Bottling up,"I think I've been bottling up my feelings for too long. Everything started back in March. At that time, I was excited to finish my college assignment which requires cooperation of some people (which requires their pictures) but I was let down by them and before I knew it, the deadline passed. When my friends asked me about my work, I dodged them because of course I never managed to finish it. Then everything went downhill starting from there. Maybe because that day affected me very much but every assignments I did started becoming harder and harder to finish and before I knew it, there's four of my courses that I didn't manage to hand in. There was group assignments too and at first, I was working happily with them; conversing in discord and all but slowly, I feel repressed. Before I knew it, I started isolating my friends altogether. Over the course of these two weeks, I've only texted one friend who doesn't have any relation with my college. Even so, I never tell her anything about this. My family started to worry but its ironic because they're one of the bad stressor that happened; and it's also ironic because I would rather be at home than at college. Not long ago, my cat died but I feel nothing. I feel like an empty husk. I lost all motivation to draw let alone writing some stories. I also feel like my health started dwindling because the last time I got exposed to the sun, I feel like fainting but managed to hold on. My mind started feeling negative and I started waking up late on daily basis. My escape currently was probably watching vtubers from nijisanji along with listening to some songs from utaites but even then, maybe because I haven't talked for too long, I decided to vent here.

YourLostChapstick,depression,1620465522.0,"Just been spilling my mind, could use some help","Desperately in need of help and guidance

Posting this in a couple subreddits but I really would love to here all of your advice. Yes 
This is very long but it’ll help understand where I am currently at with everything. Please help me.

I guess I can start off by saying I am a 21M senior in college about to get kicked out of my program for going below gpa requirement.

If I’m being honest I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore. I stop every now and then and think to myself how have I even made it here. If I’m being honest I feel like I’ve just been cruising by trying to enjoy life way too much because being younger I realized that I have a lot of freedom right now with little responsibility. Which typing out is such a terrible mindset. 

To make a short story long I am diagnosed ADHD, General Anxiety and clinical depression. I’ve been taking medication (20mg adderall IR 3x a day for ADHD and 40mg Prozac once) for a while now but honestly I’m not even sure if it really helps. I saw a therapist for a bit and was told they wanted to try psychotherapy for my disassociating then came out of contact with me. 
I had a lot of issues growing up which all play some part maybe in why I am the way I am. Sometimes I feel like I’m lying to myself about how depressed or anxious I am. I guess mostly because I’m not the typical lay in bed all day everyday depressed or socially anxiety ridden diagnoses that will have a panic attack that will happen anywhere and everywhere. Pretty much my whole life was the type that you would look at me and say that I have literally no reason to think this way or feel this way and act that way. I’ve always been I guess what you could call a social butterfly. Sometimes I tell myself that I am the most extroverted invert you could ever meet. And no I’m not here to toot my own horn or anything but I’ve never had a probably with my social life. I’ve always been an athletic kid, outgoing and funny in the friend groups and, finding out a little more recently due to just basic observation and hearing it consistently, considered very attractive so it’s mostly easygoing with girls for me. All these are reasons on why I question why me? Why am I still a overthinking, inattentive sad boy that can’t handle life? I’ve felt like this for so long that I almost couldn’t imagine life without being so tired of living it. I’ve always hated blaming anything on my mental health issues, and all my childhood trauma because it just seems like an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated and nobody wants to hear that. But I guess that’s what happens when you are raised how I was always being told these things. 

So what I’m trying to say is college has really made me realize I wasn’t ready to go right into it out of highschool. Honestly I never really believed school was for me. The only plans that I ever really had past school was to become a professional athlete and if that didn’t work they wanted me to go to the military because my grades always pretty much lacked in school. I can tell you almost the exact point on when I started giving up and it was around age 12. I was already becoming so exhausted with everything. Life has always been so forced on me and what I wanted to do, I never really got a chance to really sit and think or talk to someone about what I really wanted to do because people always knew what was best for me. It got to the point where whenever people ask what I wanna do I never even know so I always come up with some lie to sound good or like I have some goals or aspirations and I’m going to seem like this great kid who’s got everything figured out.  Yea right...

I’m tired of being afraid and shackled down. I just want to atleast get my degree so after that I can finally have some real freedom. But since I’m about to get kicked out I have no idea what to do. I don’t even know if I liked my major. I’ve changed it twice and it’s because I know they both had potential to make a lot of money. The other problem is I really hate being home. Any chance I get I try to stay away from being back home. I don’t wanna get stuck because then I know I’ll become everything I’ve always tried to avoid and been afraid of becoming. I just don’t know what to do though. I could really just use some help in figuring out what my options are and my potential paths to take. I don’t hate learning. I just hate school."

Well, to sum up I have rheumatoid arthritis (oh, and I studied music (guitar), so you can imagine).

Obviously I don´t have the symptoms at the same time for example, prostatitis with varicocele and arthritis, but there they are.

Ive literally tried to ""treat women like people"" which ive always done and they use me for money, and TOLD IM THE BAD GUY FOR IT? there was this one girl i had a huge crush on, and she was the first girl I ever asked out in my life, she rejected me and was real nice about it, and even added me on social media cause ""i seem like a good guy"" but not long after, she started asking me for money, not a lot or anything, but it started with 15 bucks here and there, then 20 bucks here and there, and it was her birthday and she asked for more money, and i have no idea why this happens but she eventually just blocked me, I didnt do anything, respected that she said no, but when she asked for money, I just liked her a lot, and idk, I didnt expect anything in return except friendship at LEAST? but no, men are there for money ig.

Ive made friends with girls i used to go to high school with, omg the quickness in which they ask for money is insane, Ill ask to hang out, and i swear they set up a day to hang out, not even a date, just as friends, and on the day of, they go to hang out with some boy, AND ASK ME TO SEND MONEY! wtf.

One girl i ended up liking, and i told her i liked her, and she said, we can only be friends, and i shit you not, the next week, she asks me to pay her fucking rent for her, or else we arent talking anymore.

Im not seen as a human being who wants connection, im seen as a walking ATM, I refused as well. But still i get told its somehow my fault that women try to use me over, and over.

Im a 23 year old virgin with no friends, no family, nothing.

I get told constantly that im simply not allowed to date for some fucking reason, then i see this sub has 2.7 million people talking about dating, and i just scratch my head, and wonder why women hate me so much.

They think just cause i havent had sex, that im some subhuman and deserve to be alone.

idek what to do, seeing everyone have families, and hook ups is making me so mad.

I want to have a dead bedroom, I want to have a wife and just never have sex, the thought of sex just disgusts me tbh, makes me angry.

ive been thinking of suicide a lot lately im so fucking lonely.

I started for the first 3 days with 1 coup in morning and after i started to take 1 more in the evening wich helped me sleep better but i have some side effects that make me worry.

Since i drink the tea i am much more anxious, worried / agitated , mental fog / confusion, headache sometimes, dry mouth etc, i have pretty much all the sides effects.

I plan to take this tea for 3 months as the doctor recommended but with all these sides effects i feel worried, are they disappearing in time and start to feel better or they will remain all the time when i drink this tea ? 

Is there any chance to make the things worst for me ? Can you guys tell me your experiences with this herbal ?

I am at the day 8 since i drink this tea but i feel weird, does this go away with time ? Is this normal as an ""activation"" symptoms so my body can adjust to it or should i stop taking it ?

How do they keep on living?, why?.
Do you think that these kind of cases are just because of instincts, biology, survival? Or is there really something universal to just stay alive for?.

I don’t want to die but for the pain to end obviously, but it’s a different case when it’s a chronic and incurable  health condition, it’s sucking the joy out of everything.
Although depression from young age, I’ve always been an hopeful person and that hope came from my logical approach to life, every problem in my past had a solution.. nowadays I’m just stuck with disgusted expression all over my face, I’ve lost my hope and spirituality (non religious spirituality).

Horse_Around,depression,1620477112.0,that's it,"that's it -- after a short \~ 1-2 month remission i am back at the bottom. during this period i saw and FELT that life can be not only less bland and awful but also actually enjoyable. i experienced how does it feel to have dreams, goals and even plans to achieve them. i tasted the pleasure of having the energy to have a daily routine, to stick to a schedule, to be organised, to have passion in life and to find joy in it. i also was horrified as i was stroke by realisation that i spent my entire conscious life as far as i remember myself in this unbearable state of numbness and having only one desire -- to disappear. it was truly scary -- to realise how hopeless and bland your whole life was when you've felt how actually good life can be. i honestly don't know what happened which caused me to feel so good but i could never recreate this feeling again. now some time has already passed since i had any desire to achieve any long term goal and had any hope for better future and my mental state was becoming only worse and worse each day. now i can't sleep without crying again, i am constantly exhausted, i started cutting again. each single thing which i practiced everyday during this short period of remission has gone and the only thing i do regularly is wasting my time on useless youtube videos. some time prior to this period of remission i used to have the desire to accomplish certain things but didn't had any energy. now everything lost any point, i not only have no energy to do anything, i also have no any motivation. i absolutely don't want anything except to disappear. know even though some things are turning out for me literally better than any time before i'm still sinking deeper and deeper back into the hole in which i spent all my previous life. i actually had a luck to get to chat to some of my uni classmates on topics other than exchanging necessary info about studying. yes, it was just some whatsapp messages but damn -- i've actually talked to someone in a way that friends usually do for the first time in 3 years. they texted me myself bc of some of my jokes in general group chat and it is probably the only way i could receive some social interaction because i don't go out anywhere and i am too anxious and awkward cowardish useless piece of shit to have balls to start a conversation with someone even through social media or a messenger. it seems almost like a miracle but the only thing that it makes me feel is being paranoid that it's some kind of conspiracy that someone like my parent asked them to talk to me because i am unable to talk to someone myself. even talking to someone in a friendly manner for the first time in 3 fucking years left me absolutely bland with a bit of anxiety after some momentary surprise and positive emotions. i cant make myself get up from the bed and, most importantly, i cant see any point in it. i just want to disappear. or i dont want even that. i am just tired, so so so tired. i feel it, i feel that there is no hope in the future.

sorry for that dumb pretentious phony crap"

ibstudent1072,depression,1620513317.0,"I'm Not An Antinatalist, But...","I'm not an antinatalist, but I feel like many parents have the wrong reasons for having children.   


Today I was deeply hurt when my parents told me why they had me. They responded with, ""Why not?"" and, ""Imagine how boring it would be without you"". They also told me that they really wanted grandchildren from as well because it would be *nice* and it would pass on the family line*.* That word ""*nice*"" really struck me. Is this really why they had a child? Because it would be *nice?*  


I don't consider myself an antinatalist because of my Christian values, but I was so pained to find out that my parents didn't really have a valid reason for having a child other than that it would be *nice*. This is the kind of reasoning that you would use before buying a pet, not before having a child. All of this pain and suffering I am experiencing just because my parents thought it would be *nice* to have me. I really don't want to hate them, but a part of me truly does. A child should never be created out of selfish reasons, but out of a will to improve the world for the better. If I ever had a child (if I even lasted that long in the first place), I would have it in the hopes of making a positive impact to the world.  


I feel really guilty as well because my parents are really nice people and I've seen many reddit posts about abusive parents. I feel guilty for my emotions because my parents have never abused me and I am aware that there are many children out there who have it so much worse than me. I can't believe that I was so deeply hurt by this conversation with my parents today when there are literally children being physically and mentally abused everyday. My situation is such a first world problem, I'm a spoilt brat, I know. Yet I can't help but feel frustrated as to their reasoning for having a child. My mom has never abused me, but I can't remember the last time she said anything good about me. I know she loves me, but... sorry I can't put my thoughts into words. I just wish I had never been born in the first place..."

Jason5Lee,depression,1620466022.0,I hate my society and I don't want to live in it.,"When I was young I was educated that our society was wonderful. If you worked hard you would get what you want. (It's not America, it may be even worse). But when I start growing up I realize my society is far from perfect (pretty bad actually). Unfair evaluation, discrimination, exploiting workers, and many other things else.  
The problem is that it's a faith collapsed for me. Others just don't believe those words in the first place and think ""well, this society is bad, but what do you expect?"". But I believed them. I thought my society was fair and justice. After the reality showed me that these were lies, I started hating them. I started feeling depressed whenever I had an unfair situation in society. I don't want to live in it if it is just full of injustice that I have to tolerate.

I've thought about leaving it, but I don't know how. Suicide? I do not dare to do this plus it would make my parents really sad. Leaving and living somewhere far away? I wonder how can I support myself and my family at that place."

And still it's disgusting.

My mom keeps lecturing me about having piles of clothing and Easter bags and etc. and it makes me feel even worse. I feel like a hypocrite since I'm always fastidiously neat at my job and can't keep my own room clean. Everyone thinks I'm so great, but I'm not. I hate who I am as a person.

WraithofPickles,depression,1620525235.0,Reacting to depression diagnosis. What was yours like?,"It's been a trying year for me. I finally and gladly started seeing a therapist a few months ago and this week she told that she thinks it's highly likely that I have depression and recommended I start on a low dose of antidepressants. Since hearing this, I feel like all my depressive symptoms and thoughts have escalated dramatically over the last few days (I have not been/will not be taking anything until I consult with my family doctor this week). 

I honestly can't tell if all of a sudden I'm just beginning to notice ""my normal"" and how horrible I've been feeling, or if I'm having an overwhelming reaction to this news, or if I'm just in a real slum right now... I am just trying to gauge if anyone else has had a similar experience. 

I am grateful to hear this in a sense, and it seems to all add up. I just can't wait to take the steps to start feeling better, but I am consumed with the thought that I might not. 

After reading so many of these posts tonight, I am feeling really sad. Please take care of yourselves as best you can. You are not alone. <3"
lippidude,depression,1620623619.0,"Anxiety, depression, brainfog (i could use some help, i just feel like my head is less me and more something foreign)","I guess today has been a particularly rough day compared to others. I cant not obsess over brainfog and the lack of mental clarity that I have. its pretty bad and invasive when it comes to carrying out my day to day. I start to blur the lines of what is really happening and what feels familiar but instead is a false memory or something misremembered. i cant think of a specific example right now, but its like I'm gravitating towards maddening patterns of thought. everyday is a loop, like I'm a goldfish forgetting every trip around the bowl. Sometimes I'll see something and as a result, remember something and get completely floored that I couldnt remember that thing earlier and it took something unrelated to prompt a thought several days after the fact. 

my depression (which haunted me extremely) has sort of subsided. I think because life feels like this anxious half forgotten haze that the depression has no space to exist with how foggy and on edge I always am. but id rather be regular old depressed me and be able to think than feel like life is just occurring around me and I have no say. 

&#x200B;

on the anxiety front, i wake up at night very confused. sometimes a dream prompts the confusion and i feel like i need to do something, though i don't know what. sometimes i am just waking up with high anxiety and panic. either way the brain fog is taking me further and further away from recognizing the reality i have woken up in. like i get so lost in the extreme emotions of panic and anxiety that the fog makes it difficult to think my way into a rational frame of mind. 

it literally feels like mass in my head taking up space and reducing the room for me to think clearly. a year ago it wasnt so bad, i lived with a manageable amount of fog. now its disrupting the way i think, so much so, that ill want to believe these super imaginative scenarios where I'm really just in the simulation, and once I'm dead everything will be ok, ill wake up and think clearly again.  and that line of thinking starts to make me anxious like I am starting to become delusional. 

&#x200B;

idk what i am getting at by relaying this all to you. but i just need help. I started dieting last week to remove some irritable bowel syndrome irritants from my intake. i got my first covid shot so I can go back to the gym and see if that will have an impact. but I feel like I'm just spiraling out of control and that something much more devastating is lurking around the corner with how worn down and on the fringe of my own reality I am starting to feel. 

please suggest something (and not smoking a bowl, I'm 29 and have no more desires to get high or use drugs as an escape). i just want to experience life again and feel motivated to live."

Most of my hobbies I've dropped, maybe picked up later and have dropped again. Also I take up multiple hobbies like playing guitar, drawing, animating, writing, etc. cause my hobbies like I said before get boring. Relationship wise is as you'd expect, kind of crap. School wise I'd say is normal like most people until I get stressed then things drop. Medically along with being diagnosed with ADHD, ADD, OCD, Insomnia, Compulsive Sexual Disorder I'm also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. My blood pressure and anxiety is another thing, my anxiety is off the charts especially at my age (24) cause I'd be more considered an inside person than an outside person who nearly breaks down just thinking about starting conversations with new people, especially girls and conversation wise I'm the worst unless I am friends with them. Nothing I think pill wise has worked for me and therapy to me is something I don't really want nor can pay for. How would you try to help yourselves if you were/are in this situation? My feelings of my depression have always been something I hate bringing up cause I feel mentally and emotionally I'm something I wouldn't want to lay out to someone, even my family, cause they probably don't have that time so people on here that pass by on here can choose whether or not they want to invest some brain in this.

I've decided to do it today though because I wanted to share my small victory that I experienced tonight.

I read a book. It was political, it was dry as fuck, I have no idea why out of all the fantastic fiction books i bought for a bit of escapism, the dry as fuck non-fiction political book was the one that kept my attention, but it is what it is. 

The reason this is such a victory is because I haven't been able to hold my focus for long enough to read a whole book in YEARS, and it's been especially hard to concentrate on anything since being on prozac. The past few months especially, everything has just been a blur, my head has been too foggy to do anything significant. But a tiny bit of clarity managed to stick around long enough for me to read a book. 

I love reading, and for the first time in years, I kept reading and reading until I reached the end of the book and I actually processed everything that I read. I honestly feel so elated right now."

deltorarox,depression,1620514017.0,"How to tell someone you want to kill yourself without saying you ""want to kill yourself""","I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for more than 5 years. Lately, I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to the edge. I want help desperately. 
The problem is that every time I've tried to reach out to a therapist or teacher or professor for help (family isn't an option) and even vaguely expressed that I had suicidal ideation (not even that I was going to kill myself) they have immediately committed me to either PHP or, most recently, an actual psych ward. This, of course involves pulling me out of school and work. As someone with a severe adjustment disorder, this just exacerbates my suicidal thoughts and I've made that very clear, but my autonomy is stripped from me nonetheless. 
At the same time, I desperately need my therapist and professors to know how depressed and suicidal I am so that they can make the necessary accommodations.  I feel like the guarded way I've taught myself to speak makes it so that the people around me don't take my depression seriously and just think I'm slacking. It's not that I'm lazy or busy, I just spend 50% of the time high because I can't deal wirh being sober and the other 50% of the time trying to stab myself with a letter opener because my friend had to take all of the sharp stuff out of my apartment. But I can't tell that to my professors or they'll report me and the school will force me to go to the mental hospital again. Then I won't be able to transfer and I'll literally kill myself.

Life was going okay for the most part to start, obviously covid and all but I was doing okay. I had began to exercise alot more and was seeing improvements in my body. I was doing well in school and was confident I would get into my dream college. I was talking to a girl recently who I liked and we really clicked. Life was going well.

Then this is where it all goes wrong. I then suffered a back injury 3 months ago. I have had this back injury for months and I have had to stop exercising, I can do any sports and I feel as if All my work is going to waste. Its not going away and I had an MRI and found I may have to deal with this pain for life. All of the solutions they have tried have failed and I am scared I will never be able to do activities I enjoy again.

It only gets worse from their, my dream college waitlisted me and I stunned as so many people who didn’t deserve to get in got in. I had no backup plan as I was very confident I would get in, I did apply to other colleges but had no interest in attending them.  To add on to it, the girl I was talking to suddenly ghosted and then blocked me . I don’t know why I said nothing and I just feel ashamed like I did something wrong. To add on to all of this is my grandma who has gotten very sick and her condition is worsening. I have struggled to concentrate in school and have lost all motivation and my parents are mad That my grades are falling. My parents get angry that I am overreacting.

I have seen a doctor, but he suggested I take my adhd pills, but I hate relying on them and they make me feel super tired. I feel like everything is just getting worse everyday and nothing gets better. Nothing has gotten better and I don’t see anything getting better. I have stopped seeing my friends as often and I spend alot more time alone. 

I just want to get away from everything. Sometimes I just get the urge to just drive away somewhere and escape from all these problems. I just can’t take this anymore. I feel so alone and I just want to cry. I don’t know what to anymore."
himankjoshi,depression,1620622437.0,Well,I’ve got a voice at the back of my head that constantly reminds me how much of a screw up I am and how ending my life would just make things easier for everyone around me. I dont know if other people get this but it pops up every day and battling it seems harder and harder everyday. I feel like I might give in soon. Maybe he’s right. What’s the point.
Dubov2446,depression,1620632661.0,Life in college after HS,"Idk what it is, but I just cannot for the life of me move on. I had soooo many friends in hs but now I have absolutely zero, not even fake friends, I basically live in isolation at the point. With college being online the only reason I leave my room is to go to work. I haven’t even replaced my burnt out headlight from 4 days ago. Can’t sum up the energy to put on clothes and go to the store during the day time with the sun out. I met two people last year on campus but then moved away too, so that was fun. All my old friends seem to be doing good, I see them posting pics/post about marriage, babies, houses, travels, and careers and I have none of those. You know how people get seasonal depression cause the winter so dark and gloomy? That’s what summer feels like to me now. The thought of sun, light, heat, and vibrant colors make me so sad. I just want to move to Alaska and open a small shop and living in a cabin in the woods. Cold, dark, and filled with snow. Maybe one day. I did meet this girl online about three weeks ago and we’ve been taking on snap and stuff. She does make my day better but it’s not the same as having someone in person. But I’m too scared to do anything about it lol so pretty much a lost cause. Idk if this is okay but would anyone be down for a chat? It’s late at night and I don’t want to drink/cry myself to sleep tonight, a distraction would be nice. Sorry for long post, thanks for reading if you’re this far."

He has dealt with depression for several years and is in treatment and doing quite well although at times he does have bad days (as he calls them). When he does this he does not want to be around me and doesn't want me to see that side of him. He said he thinks it would ruin our relationship. He hasn't had to cancel plans with me except a couple of times. When he does I have a hard time knowing how to deal with it. I can't help being sad and disappointed and I'm not good at hiding how I feel so he usually knows. Then I feel like I'm not being understanding enough because I'm so disappointed and upset. The thing is I don't know how to not feel like that. Also when this happens it makes me want to pull back my feelings a bit. To protect myself from that disappointment. I don't know how to explain it. I want to be supportive to him, but I don't know how to and I have my own emotions I'm dealing with when this happens so then I want to protect myself. How can I deal with this and support him in a way that is healthy for us both?"

I’ve had depression(tho not clinically diagnosed due to underdeveloped medical care and mental awareness in my country)for over a decade now. Attempt suicide and hospitalization twice. 
I’ve had toxic parents who were the main causes that led me to this state b it they are what’s called “tricky family” and their narcissism doesn’t show in public, making it extremely difficult for me to receive by understanding or empathy from others.

I mean I am a generally anxious and sad person but I'm on summer break so I'm free and I have like no responsibilities to be weighing me down at the moment. So I feel like I shouldn't be feeling like this. Obviously feeling like this is never fun and great but at least I usually know why I'm sad. I guess I just got a wave of anxiety and sadness come over me and now I can't sleep and I don't know what to do.

 I definitely need a therapist and I hope to get one through my college soon (definitely by fall, maybe even in summer if I gather the courage to contact the wellness center). But until then I don't know how to cope. I usually just ignore it mostly because I don't feel like I have the time to address it with all my homework in the school year, and because I tell myself I'm just sad because of school and that's normal because everyone in my generation (gen Z) is at least a little bit depressed because of school, but now I'm feeling the same in summer and I'm realizing life might just be depressing.

And he was anguished with how much he felt made me suffer and how he thought I would be better off with someone who could give to me .  This is so hard for me to understand. I would’ve helped him in anyway possible and loved and supported him until the end of my days. Even if he couldn’t give back to me. 

He said I made him feel safe and loved and happier than anyone else. How can I make sense of this? I ask that you help me understand the perspective of a depressed person on this. It’s hard for me to understand why he would give up a source of comfort and love.

I love him so much and hate to think of him alone and in misery. And then I start to hate myself because I wonder if I was a better girlfriend  that I could have helped him and he would not leave me. The logical part of me says that I did everything I could but my heart doesn’t feel that way.  At the same time I loved him so much and he knew it. Any insight would be appreciated."

ausername-,depression,1620536675.0,All I have is love nobody ever wanted.,"I'm a really kind and sweet and affectionate person, but I don't really show it all that often. For a lot of reasons. A lot of it has to due with my social anxiety and other social shortcomings, and a lot of it has to do with my abusive childhood. I tend to withdraw often.

But even when I manage to find people I'm capable of opening up to, no one really wants to be very close to me for very long. All I want is to love, and to be loved, but nobody wants any of my love, and certainly nobody wants to love me.

It's so sad and defeating. Small, simple things mean so much to me. Being able to hug someone. To hold them. I've been touch starved for so long. In my early 20s I actually went over a year without ever touching another person - not even bumping into somebody in line at the grocery store, or brushing a cashier's hand accidentally. And for most of the other years, and the last couple of my teenage years, I didn't get touched very much more than that. It would be more common than not to have not touched anybody at all for weeks at a time. Or months. I think about how that might've affected me, sometimes.

Even growing up I was pretty touch starved - and certainly affection starved. Both toward me, but also in regards of expressing my own. I was so affectionate as a young child but when my family split up and after all those years of trauma, neglect and abuse, it left me without anybody to express those feelings toward and an inability to kind of find anybody else to serve as a surrogate.

I dunno. I'm in a relationship with someone - it's long distance - who isn't very affectionate, and sometimes I feel like my constant expressions of affection is just annoying to her. She doesn't reciprocate often, and she gets put off with my enthusiasm and excitement when she tepidly does. It's hard.

I dunno why I'm even writing all this out. I'm just laying in bed, kind of morose, and it's on my mind. Life is hard. I wish it was easier to be happy."

G-Double-D,depression,1620518746.0,Getting tired…,"Lately I’ve been feeling detached from myself. I’m coming up on my year and a half anniversary of being sober and HIV+. It’s been a lot to take in and deal with. If there ever was a time to drink it would be after that diagnosis. 
Backstory, I’ll keep it short because what I’m about to write is the reason I’m tired. Last year I had a psychotic break, fell and bashed my head on the concrete and got a concussion. At the hospital I found out I had pneumonia and encephalitis. And oh yeah, by the way, your HIV+. I spent a month in the ICU, which I don’t remember. I don’t remember 99% of that month and still don’t. Encephalitis and concussions cause memory loss and I got’em both at the same time. My short term memory is still terrible. My long term is super spotty. Things I know I should remember but can’t. My mom and little brother came to see me and I don’t remember that, and that makes me sad still. I missed Thanksgiving and Christmas. My best friend of 27 years came to see me everyday. Love him to no end. He said the nurse said I was close to death and they weren’t sure how well I’d recover cognitively. So. There’s no drinking in the ICU so that was my rehab. When I got out I had no impulse to drink. It was gone. Poof. One guy on here said I was a “spontaneous remitter” and that’s rare. I walked out sober, vegan (that happened in there too) and positive with a shitty memory. I’m tired of telling this story. Yes I know I’m a survivor. And I’m doing great. One day at a time! People with HIV live long, good lives. Blah blah blah. Coming up on this anniversary is just making me think about the last year and a half and I don’t think I’ve fully dealt with it. I realized the other day that I’d been talking  for granted that I’m alive. I almost died. I mean what do you do with that? I’m in trying to overcome that. 
So that’s why I’m tired. Could be worse. I know, but I don’t know anyone I can relate to with all this. So it just sits on my brain. I’m sure in time this anniversary and it’s impact will lessen. But the thing is, I’m impatient. =]"

My problem is emotional, but therapy can't change emotions. It only changes behavior. At my core I'm a used up former gifted kid haunted by they days when I used to feel the rush of ideas and passions through my head, and what I want more than anything else is to feel that sensation again.

But I can't.

I don't know how to get back what I lost, and it's becoming abundantly clear that nobody – not me, not my therapist, not anyone I've talked to on the internet – has any idea how to do this or even if its possible. I invest my trust in a therapist because I know I can't rely on myself, but ultimately investing that trust in someone else is equally unhealthy. It means I convince myself that they have answers when they don't, and because I fail to get the answers I'm looking for I get frustrated at the world, lash out at the people I think are withholding happiness from me, when the simple fact is there's no happiness to be had

I can't make myself happier, but I'm sure as hell making myself more miserable by continuing"

How do you smile that smile?

So convincingly coaxing

With your charm, all the while,

Driving me to the brink with your finger stroking.

Strumming me like the finest Strat

We harmonized beautifully … heavenly … blissfully…

Then, little by little, it all went flat.

According to you everything so hastily

Turned acrid and putrid... just like that!

Then from where I cannot tell you

You blasted a dagger razor sharp and true.

So head-over-heels and trusting, I was completely blindsided,

Before I could grasp the reality of one,

A second hit me, as I hit my knees so misguided,

And then a third struck, and I was done.

Who are you?

I hear you talking.

It sounds like you.

But my love wouldn’t leave me choking,

Trying to breathe through all the tears.

Who ARE you?

You look like my man.

But my love would take me in his arms

And hold me as close as he can.

That’s what he’d do, that’s what he’d do,

That’s what HE'D DO!"

I didn't peace out for attention but I think it's funny how not a single friend of mine even realize how close they came to losing me. Not a single message from anyone in the 16 hours of driving I did. I'd wager a week could go by and still no one would know or even care. It's absolutely pathetic.

I'm struggling to rationalize any reason not to just leave again. I'm in my 30s and it's always been this way ever since I was a kid. It's no one's fault, no outer forces making my life like this; it's me. And as long as I'm stuck having to live in my own skin my life will always be full of heartbreak and loneliness. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. This world is so much more Darwinian than anyone ever wants to admit and unfortunately I'm one of the rejects. I'll never be good enough for anyone. I've been trying to improve my life with hard work but it's futile because as long I am fundamentally me no one will ever want me. There's nothing to live for; nothing to work for and persevere for. I'm worth nothing and that's the truth. That's reality."

localgaypunk,depression,1620583661.0,I don’t feel like trying anymore,"Every leg up I could’ve had getting to college was thwarted by my parents. I should’ve had a few hundred dollars of cushion, I shouldn’t have paid for my tuition out of pocket, I shouldn’t be forced into withdrawal. But my dad won’t do the minimum and the stress of it all is too much. When I was already down my mother took my car and gave it to my stepdad’s deadbeat alcoholic brother. A person I thought was a good friend helped me but decided they missed their own comfort, even if doing so meant screwing me over. Cpstd is making it impossible for me to live, I don’t even enjoy anything anymore. Everything I love is rooted in trauma. I’m just so tired of living, I wouldn’t have to worry about any of this if I was dead. I never wanted to be here and now that’s my problem. Now today is just reminding me that I should be thankful for my life because of everything my mom went through to put me here... I wish she would’ve taken me out when she kept threatening to. I left my apartment for the first time in a week yesterday to take out trash. I’m just so tired of having no way to get back up that won’t fall through eventually."

fckmymil,depression,1620465067.0,Lying to my therapist,"I've been depressed most of my life. Honestly I don't think I can remember a time when I wasn't depressed, although I'm sure I was a fairly happy kid. I've been in therapy on and off for the past few years, but only started going regularly after losing my brother and nephew to a car accident last year. 

Thing is I lie to her every session. Tell her I'm doing better than I am. Accomplishing goals when I'm not. I know this defeats the purpose of therapy but I don't think it's any of her business. I only go so I can get the prescription for antidepressants that at least make sure I'm functioning and can take care of my kids.

I've always felt ambivalent about being alive. Now that my brother is gone I know I can't do anything to cause my parents further pain. To deprive my husband and kids. But dammit I'm pissed that I can't just shut it all off. I just realized that I can't even remember the last time I brushed my teeth. I only shower every day because with two kids it's the only alone time and peace I get. It's a crap shoot whether I actually wash or just sit in the water. 

I dont want to die because of the pain it would cause my family, but I am just so fucking tired. All of the time. And I just want the pain to stop."

And whenever I don't talk about depression he thinks that I don't have it anymore and that I'm cured if I laugh or some dumb bullshit like that. We hanged out a few weeks ago and he told me ""you don't seem depressed to me"" and IT MADE ME SO MAD. Yesterday, I told him I hated the world and that I want to die.

Rich_Construction_85,depression,1620605778.0,Therapist is pushing me to have a relationship with my dad and it’s making me depressed,"Hey,

A little background about me I am a 24F and my relationship with my dad is not the best. For all of my life my dad has been working so when I was younger I didn’t see him much because he would say he was always working. Sometimes he would tell me he would see me on the weekends but never show up. When I did see him it was only for a few hours then he would leave. I don’t know much about his side of the family I don’t know where he lives I don’t know his mom or dad. A lot of information I’m missing and it’s like the half of me is missing. This also is causing issues when it comes to me dating or having men in my life. Most of them are just like him in some ways. But I’ve told my therapist about how I don’t know much about him like his family where he lives where he is from etc.. my therapist always tells me I should reach out to him and ask him these things. I was supposed to do that today but I just could t bring myself to asking him. I don’t even know how to do it. I know this is weird but I don’t really know him so it gives me anxiety whenever I have to talk to him. It’s taking me a very long time to go forth with having this conversation with him it’s not easy and I’m just so overwhelmed with this. It’s frustrating. My next session with my therapist is Monday and I’m afraid to tell my therapist I still can’t bring myself to ask him. It’s kind of embarrassing for me too because I’m older now and I still struggle with this."
Kraymur,depression,1620533639.0,I'm so fucking tired.,"I don't even really know how to start this off, I haven't been happy in what seems like a decade. It started when me and my HS girlfriend broke up (my fault.) and honestly I thought i'd recover but it seems to just weigh me down. This isn't the reason for my writing, it's just one of the earliest times I could think back to before I stopped being the person I was. I had friends, I was quick witted and well read, I didn't really have a problem with talking to people (atleast compared to what I am now.) I ended up homeless for a little while when my moms landlord kicked us out, the landlady had alot of issues, needless to say we ended up in tents at a campground for a year until we were about to move to a small town after my mom got a car loan. This new town is horrible, I don't drive so work is extremely limited, everyone here is the complete opposite of me (farmers, meth heads, low-tier gangmembers.) I've been unemployed for 2 months at this point and the only available jobs are Warehousing and Manufacturing - jobs i've worked for years that have burnt me out but even those aren't calling me back with my years of experience. I just, I DON'T want to work myself out of this. I'm done trying to pull myself up and just get down again. I started off poor as shit, my mom met a good duy after my father left and she cheated on him because she has issues regarding ""bad boys"" being her type. Ruined my fucking life for a dalliance with a gang banger, we lived good with my new dad, he was amazing, cared about us, provided a good living, he left when I was 13 after my mom had us move in with her and her piece of shit boyfriend. My whole life has been highs and lows, it's never been constant. I have crippling social anxiety from a mixture of being bullied, generally overbearing and controlling parent (mom) and what not. My social skills are completely drained at this point because I just... didn't want to BE AROUND other people after my girlfriend and I had broken up so I just shut myself in.   


I know what I need to do to get better, but I have no want or willpower to do it, I would be content to stop existing at this very moment. I don't want empathy, I know people go through what I do on a daily basis, I don't want opinions on how to fix my situation - i've known for awhile. I just don't want any of this anymore. I don't want money, I dont want a family, I dont want nice things, I don't want to work some bullshit job anymore just so I can barely afford rent and basic things and I sure as shit don't want to spend years and get myself into debt for the offchance of finding a good job with some bullshit degree. Why is this so fucking hard, I feel like people are swimming by me and i'm just barely able to keep my head above water, stuck in the same fucking spot just barely keeping from drowning. And the response to this? ""swim harder"" ""just try a little harder"" Ive been trying my entire fucking life, telling myself ""this doesn't define me"" ""I can make myself better"" ""I can undo what's been done by just being better"" It. hasn't. worked. I have no friends, and I don't blame them. I can't converse with people anymore, my mind just goes blank and reverts to small talk bullshit that noone likes. I don't follow up with people because I noticed if I don't message them first they'll just not talk to me anymore.   


At this point my mom is the only thing keeping me going, but she's fucked in the head worse than I am, thinking she's psychic and shit and everything to do with her just drags me down even more. I can't do this anymore as much as I want to. I have no want to do good things anymore, I have no desire to be a better person or make myself into who I thought i'd be. I want to die."
idontexist1300,depression,1620442392.0,I’m going crazy and I can’t tell anyone,"These last few months have been the best and worst months I’ve experienced in my life. I (20M) have decided I’m going to quit my college sport because I don’t have a passion for it anymore. Ive done sports my entire life and I’m truly tired and have nothing more to give in that part of life. The issue is my father won’t give me a break. I told him I’m going to quit a few months ago but he keeps trying to manipulate me into playing “one more season”. That’s what he says every time. But every time I tell him no he tries to make it like I’m doing him a disservice by making a decision that’s best for me. I’m really tired of being manipulated by my parents because they’ve even gone as far as hinting that they’d no longer support me financially if I choose to make my own decisions for my life. The mind games and manipulations have always been there and I’m seeing it now more than ever. On top of that I have no control over my money. I have a pretty nice chunk of money saved up from working but my parents have access to my bank account and don’t let me see a penny unless they see fit. They literally have full control over everything I do. I eat away at my money sometimes but a lot of times I want to invest it for something that will benefit my career but I have to get their approval first and 9/10 times I get a “no” or “later” from them.
Another major issue is that my closest friend and confidant (my girlfriend) is pushing me away from her. She recently told me “I doubt you’d be a committed father”. That stung because how can you even draw that conclusion let alone say it out loud to me. I’ve given her no reason to doubt my commitment. I’ve told her I’m not ready for kids but the fact that she thinks I’m incapable of being committed to them if I had them is heartbreaking. I think she uses the fact that I don’t like being tasked with babysitting kids that aren’t mine as a reason that I wouldn’t be there for MY kids and I don’t see the correlation at all. What really pisses me off is that she has a plethora of her own issues that I’d never use against her especially when it comes to her ability to commit even though SHE’S the one with commitment issues so who does she think she is to judge my character in that way? Ive been the poster boyfriend for her, she and her family have pointed it out several times but lately it’s rare that I feel like she’s there for me. She’s been very dismissive about how I feel when she says certain stuff. And I never here good job from her anymore. She’s always critiquing what I do and say. I know I can do things better in my life in terms of effort and I try but it’s not like I’m behind the curve or on pace to be a bum. I’m lazy at times but it doesn’t hinder my progress in life in any way. What’s crazy is know matter how much she screws up I always uplift her but when I mess up she makes me feel like I lack common sense.

This is all overwhelming because whether it’s my family or my girlfriend it feels like any move I make is never the right one. Im supposed to be able to talk to both about my feelings but I can’t talk to either. I’m always being criticized and manipulated and when I want to make a decision that’s best for me no one wants to support it. I feel like I’ve never had control over my life and I want it so bad but everyone seems to ignore my feelings. I cried for the first time in a while today because I can’t talk to anyone about how I feel without them invalidating my emotions. I’m tired and it’s making me lose my motivation to move my life forward. I just want everyone to disappear until I can get my own life together. I don’t feel loved or appreciated right now. It feels like im paying a debt to everyone when in actuality I owe no one nothing"

field-of-daisies,depression,1620531899.0,kind of exhausted with life,"**don't worry, not gonna off myself**

sounds like the beginning of a popular teen novel, but don't worry folks: my life, although boring, isn't as repetitive and bland as said popular teen novel (there are some exceptions but i am not here to talk about that today, though i'm always interested in chatting about novels), and it's more repetitive in the high school bell schedule type of way. i do the same things every day but sometimes in one of the tasks i do (here is where i insert that high school bell schedule analogy: sometimes in one of the classes) something inconvenient happens, like i forget to brush my teeth for a week (or a fight breaks out at 7 am, seriously what was up with high school)----and at first its annoying but as the week(s) progress you get used to it type of repetitive, and you sit with that disgusting taste in your mouth and wonder why life is so........like this. why life is so tiring and boring and grey.

sometimes i wonder if i've always been this way, because whenever i feel like i am happy again, it feels almost fake. like i made up the feeling in my head, and now i'm back to normal, this dysthymic, indifferent mood on the outside and chaos inside. i find myself overthinking things too much with my relationship (i also have bpd, so that's pretty much always going on in my head) which drive me into long nights staring at the ceiling wondering if i will push him away farther than i have because i'm so... like this. i find myself wondering if i could ever amount to anything, like if i could ever go back to college after dropping out last october (because i was psychotically depressed), and if i could ever actually earn my bachelors, hell-----could i ever really earn a masters? 

i'm just kind of at the exhausted plate of life right now. where i don't really know what to do, i kinda just put this nice face on for everyone (at home, at work, generally just in public) but i'm suffering, intensely. i hate speaking about things out loud so here i am speaking about them on the internet. i am so tired. i don't even feel sad, to be honest with you----i am so calm but not. i am so tired. that's really it.

I am so totally out of sync with the average person, that I really think that there is no coming back at this point.  Life has been a series of defeats and the only control that I feel that I could wrest from my life is upon ending it.  I want to make the people around me proud, but then life beats me into submission.  I am getting more fucked up by the day.  I will drink myself to death soon, at least, I hope.  My liver or gallbladder or something hurts every day, but I will probably drink again tomorrow.  I am sad that I couldn't make those that care about me proud, but at this point that probably isn't even possible, and death would be preferable.  I have struggled with this menace for 15 years, and nothing has changed.  It is probably my own fault, but even knowing that, it doesn't make it any better.  Nothing feels possible.  Nothing feels pleasurable.  This world is decayed and corrupted, and there are only closed doors.  That is what it looks like to me at least.  How can people be happy with the status quo?  I can't stand it.  I ask myself if I can stand another year, or 5, or 10.  And the answer is - ""No"".  I cannot.  That seems like an impossible challenge."

hiddenboi6,depression,1620569284.0,"Thinking of bettering my life at times, then it just fades away.","In short, i’ve been living my life on repeat essentially for the past two years. Ever since I’ve graduated highschool I’ve had... no plans for anything. I’m a NEET, basically.

I’ve had my own share of troubles and conflict. Sometimes I really like to imagine myself fixing my issues, mending hurt relationships with friends, and actually finding motivation. But once I snap back to reality it’s hard to even start on anything. I have so many things I would like to say or do to make things better but it’s just difficult for me to even get started.

I feel like a burden to everyone else around me. I’ve provided nothing. I can’t drive, never had a job, not even in college, no experience whatsoever. I still feel like a child despite being an adult. My own parents even treat me like a child, I’ve heard them crack “jokes” and gossip about me to other family members at times. I feel like i’m not appreciated anywhere. 

My parents aren’t abusive, they do care for me. But in short I’m also afraid of them. I feel like I have to constantly wear a mask around my family, and try to minimize any interactions with them often. I often feel like I’m a disappoint and they know it. I used to be a straight A, honor roll student until sometime in High school where I just burnt out and fell into a downwards spiral. I never really recovered since.

I often feel like i’m putting up a facade. I find myself lying to make others hear what they want to hear, to make myself appear socially acceptable. I’m so sick and tired of feeling fake but I’m tired of embarassing myself.

chickofthewoods,depression,1620464278.0,My family doesn't understand how much I'm struggling,"Hi, hope this is the right place to ask this, I'm still very new to reddit. My family knows I'm depressed. I told my mom and she told everyone else just like she always tells everyone everything, even if it's something private.In my family nobody talks about their feelings. When I told my mom about my depression I literally said 'oh btw my therapist said I'm depressed lol' and when tried to tell her might be depressed years ago she literally laughed at me. Anyways- To this day I have been masking it for other people so well that it looks like I am completely fine. It really takes it toll on me it costs a lot of energy and when I get back home I break down. It's just that I don't know how much longer I can keep it up. I don't know what to do because I literally want to die but I just don't know how to tell anyone that I can't come visit them because it's too much. I also don't want to cut them off entirely because they mean well. Does anyone have any experience with this or any advice? Thanks in advance :)"
focusrunner79,depression,1620587430.0,I'm starting to view life differently,"I'm curious to see if anyone else is experiencing this. I've struggled with severe anxiety and moderate depression for years. Within the past year, I developed a condition called parosmia because of COVID. Basically, it makes it so almost anything with a scent and flavor smells and tastes like trash.

Now, I've been a huge foodie my entire life, and food has been a primary source of happiness for a majority of my life. And now, I enjoy food 50%. Sometimes I have a meal and wash it down just so I don't have to suffer through the taste and smell of it.

Now I can't tell myself ""It will get better."" These past couple years, my goal has been to find a good paying job so I can afford all the food I want. And right when I get that job, paying $17/hr + commission, I get this condition.

I'm at the point where I feel like I'm living life through a television screen. I've emotionally detached from almost everything. It feels like everything I see, hear, feel, I'm experiencing it second hand. I don't feel the emotions I used to. Knowing that I'm depressed and one of my only sources of happiness is gone, I just don't feel connected to life.

The only benefit to this condition and my severe anxiety is I don't fear death anymore. I love falling asleep, and hate waking up most days."
sunnnyflowers,depression,1620535113.0,my friend is suicidal and i don’t know what to do anymore,"my friend (17f) is extremely suicidal and has been for a while and i really don’t know what to do anymore and i was wondering if anyone had any advice ? i’ve tried everything and i’ve been there for her to vent to, tried giving her advice, and just talking to her about random stuff, but then nights like tonight she says that the only reason she didn’t kill herself today was because she couldn’t find her pills and then she took a nap. i’m trying my best but i genuinely cannot handle it anymore because every time she texts me stuff like this it just makes my anxiety worse but i don’t want it to seem like i’m not there for her i just need a break even though i know she can’t just turn off her depression.

i feel like calling someone to check on her would just make this situation worse because if she gets hospitalized or something i know she’ll be extremely mad at me, and i dont feel comfortable telling any of our other friends because either they don’t know or if i tell them im worried they’ll then tell her what i said and then she’ll get mad at me and do something irrational because she has said multiple times she doesn’t want to see a therapist or anything even though thays probably the best option at this point. 

i just can’t handle not being sure if i’m going to wake up and she’s going to be gone anymore and i don’t know what to do."

VokkLuka,depression,1620452835.0,I am a huge coward and a complete failure,"  

This is probably the first time ever that I opened up my depression to someone else. It’s probably gonna be really long, so someone might not finish this. And English is not my first language you see, so there would be a lot of mistake and my choice of words and sentences might be not really good.

I just feel so tired right now. So I’m from South-East Asia and in here, parents’ words are very important and it is just the tradition here. It is almost impossible to change now for me. So during Covid-19 I come home to live with my parents because I’m 22, don’t have a job, still in college with not very good grade. I keep trying u know help around the house, housework. But for all things you do, they will all down fall to just one mistake. Then here come “These day, you are doing nothing. All you is eat. Not helping around…” much more. I did tried talk back a few things only to worsen the mood. I just don’t what to do to please them.

When I was in middle school, my parents have to become worker in South-Korea to make money to support family. During that time, kids grow very slowly. I didn’t feel much at first. Without knowing, I start to feel distant from everyone. I start to be by myself more and more. I can’t focus on my study. And when I fail one test with was quite important but won’t affect my final grade, it was a hard fall. I just can’t get up. 

In college, it just got worsen. My memory start failing my choice of subject is completely off. Interior design for one year was a no because it is expensive and not my type of thing to do. IT third now, my mind is now just tired. I can’t focus. I should have choose Foreign Language. But now I’m scared cause I’m using my parents’ money for college payment. And it is third year now. I feel like a complete failure and really afraid to talk to my parents about it.  What to do?

Idk why but I’m really scared of getting a job even a part time. I can hardly breathe when thinking about moving forward to try new things. And I’m not close to my friend as before as I start to get depression.

I’m gay but I never open up about it. No one know I am one except for one of my friend but he was really rich and hanging out with him just feel so awkward. I only had one crush in high school which I confessed him when I’m in college which was failure. And I haven’t speak to him since. So I never really been in relationship. Maybe I can find one?? Nahhh I’m not a good looking guy, too tall to be a bottom, too skiny ( I have been in the same 48 kg for 5 years now never gain any weight). Gym? I just don’t have time and feel really embarrassed about going. I am too afraid to be in a real relationship.

I’m a very boring person. I’m bored of things really fast even game. I can’t chat for long. I start feel bored and run out of topic to talk about really fast which make me afraid of chatting with someone else cause I’m afraid I might upset them.

So this is it. Thank you guys for reading this. There are a lot more but these are things that are mainly really not in good way right now. Also I’m feel much better while writing this which make me really sleepy. I did think of suicide a couple time but never get to do it. Thank guys!!"

Hellolovelys05,depression,1620614278.0,The worst part,"The worst part is that I feel sad for no reason. I feel despair and sadness and emptiness for no reason. And each day I try to fight it, fight that I have trauma and I’m hurt and that Im feeling these emotions. I shove them down and go about my day and distract myself with highschool, books, tv and friends so that I’m so tired and so worn out that I have no energy to acknowledge them. But then the night comes and there’s that 3 hours before bed when the wheels in my mind start to turn and the saddens and pain and despair and emptiness comes back. There’s no reason for it, I’m not sick, no one in my family is dying, I have great friends and school and in the day I feel ok. But I’m realizing that my sadness is just their because I won’t acknowledge past trauma and past experiences. I won’t acknowledge the pain I’ve gone through because I don’t know what to do with it. And I need help but I can’t afford it so I’m stuck in a viscous cycle where everyday I want to die when I wake up so I distract myself till I’m so exhausted I’ll pass out and my pain and emotions get ignored until they burst out. And I can’t stop, I know what I need but I don’t want help, I don’t want change because my pain has been by my side my whole life. Is there even anything else? Do I even deserve happiness? I don’t know and I can’t afford help anyway."

Funky_Goggles,depression,1620432184.0,My teeth and dental work have sent me into my worst depression and at this point I just don't want teeth anymore,"Not sure if this belongs here or in a different sub or of it even belongs in a sub at all...if anyone has suggestions on where else to put this mess of a post let me know and I'll take it down.

I recently went to the dentist after 3 years. I was never great at taking care of my teeth (mostly due to mental health reasons), and I avoided going to the dentist because of anxiety. Well, turns out I need a lot of dental work done. I have multiple cavities (more than 10), need two crowns, had a root canal and possibly might need another root canal for a different tooth. I decided to start all this work because I wanted to be more confident in my self and in my smile, but it's having the opposite effect.

Three weeks ago I had fillings done on 3/4ths of my mouth. Ever since then my bite has just been off. Everytime I close my mouth to chew something they feel like they knock into each other. I've gone to my dentist at least 4 times to get them adjusted but he never adjusts them right. I tell him while I'm in the chair that they are still off and he basically tells me to deal with it. Last week I went in everyday to get them adjusted and I'm still stuck with pain and the inability to chew or close my mouth.

One of my teeth had an infection for nine months. I was dealing with it, but needed a root canal. A few days ago my dentist thought that the pain I was having from the bad adjustments on the fillings was due to the pain of the infected tooth, so he scheduled me an emergency root canal. I'm now in pain from that, plus I'm still in pain from the badly adjusted fillings. 

I still need the two crowns (one being on the tooth with the root canal I just had done) and the last 1/4th of my cavities done. I might also need another root canal for a different tooth.

I haven't eaten solid food in 3 weeks. I've broken down in tears and had panic attacks every other, and sometimes every day, from the pain of my teeth and the frustration of not being able to eat real food. My boyfriend asks me if I want to get pizza or some other solid food and I have to say no even though I want that food so bad. I know the minute I start chewing and those fillings hit each other, I know I'll be in intense pain so therefore I can't eat solid food. I'm so sick of applesauce, yogurt, pudding, mashed potatoes and ice cream. It's been three weeks and I just want to eat some real food. I've lost 10 pounds because I'm not getting the proper nutrients for my body no matter how much food I eat. 

Let's add in the financial stress too. I'm 23 and on state insurance so basically nothing is covered and I'm paying for this out of pocket. My parents refuse to help and I just graduated college last year. With COVID, I'm unable to get a job in my field so I'm stuck working a minimum wage job that I don't even want to go to anymore because I'm so depressed and in pain from my teeth.

I also work night shift and my dentist is only open 9-5, which is when I sleep. So, I've been getting very little sleep in an attempt to try and make my teeth better and to not be in pain. The fact that I have to keep going to the dentist daily is making me lose sleep and lose my mind.

I'm also ruining my relationship with my boyfriend because all I do is complain to him about my teeth or that my teeth hurt. Even when I don't mean to. He knows something is wrong and everytime intell him it's my teeth he does a big sigh and I can tell he's sick of me telling him. When I have mental breakdowns because of it, I know he is just comforting me because he has no other choice. I feel so bad because I'm being a horrible girlfriend who just wants to cry and complain about my teeth. I haven't been intimate or spent any time with him because of the mental state I'm in and because of the pain I'm in. It's only a matter of time before he breaks up with me over this.

I'm so sick of my teeth, I honestly sometimes wish that they would just be knocked out of my face so I didn't have to deal with them and the stress they are causing me. They have caused me more harm than good. They hurt, they're causing me not to be able to eat properly, they're ruining my sleep schedule, they're ruining my finances, they're ruining my relationship with my boyfriend and they're ruining my mental health. I'm mentally drained and I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up crying because of all the harm they've done to my life in the past few months. Like during my breakdowns I have suicidal thoughts over this stress of my teeth. (Want to disclose that I'm not feeling suicidal right now, but in the past have been suicidal over my teeth and got help for it). I wish I never would have gone to the dentist to find out what work I needed done. All it did was put me in a worse place."
Skullmaggot,depression,1620632645.0,Deadlines and what may have been the source of my stress.,"I think deadlines have been causing me undue stress, but I suppose the easiest way to rethink them is to just be comfortable getting things done past their deadline. That way, your output is more accommodating to your energy and mood, and your health is prioritized over arbitrary due dates. Being okay with getting things done after the due date relieves some stress about getting it done, which allows you to work more efficiently, which paradoxically gives you a greater chance of getting it done before the deadline anyway!

Hope this is of some help.

hotlava98,depression,1620641488.0,My father died without me really getting to know him,"I'm adopted but I've always been in contact(maybe available is a better word). I remember when i was 11 he bought me super smash brothers for the wii and i played it so much. He also got me a laptop but it went to my older brother because i really didn't need it as a kid.

Anyways about two years ago he was dying . My birth mother told me  but I didn't believe her because she's been fucked up to my birth siblings and I was so focused on work back then.

It makes me so sad to think about. I didn't even go to his funeral because of social anxiety and not being able to drive but thats really not an excuse. I havent thought about this in so long because i hate thinking about it.

Like my anxiety
And personal hang ups just kept me from being there and i hate myself for it. 

I really wish i knew him. My birth mother just wanted to put me on her section 8 and dangle a living space over my head(she did this to my sister who literally had nowhere else to go)

GhosKatt,depression,1620625841.0,I made my mom cry on Mother's Day,"It's not that my mom is the worst but I do blame her for being part of the reason why I suffer from depression and violent tendencies. I don't even know if I love her anymore, I think I used to before, but now I'm just numb. All I feel towards her is just hate, she destroyed my every bit of love for her.

Others might call me ungrateful, heck, I even think of myself as ungrateful but I just can't forgive the things she did to me, and it outweighs all the good things she'd done for me. She told me that I never thought of her as a mother and she's right, I can't respect her as a mother because she never acted like a mother towards me. Even if she guilt trips me by saying how she carried me in her belly for 9 months and cared for me when I was a baby, how am I able to remember all that? All I remember are the bad things and how I always regretted ever being born. And when I tell her about her mistakes, she doesn't even admit to it but blames me for everything instead. I can't even show my sadness, anger, frustrations towards her because she would just get mad at it. She tells me that I make her feel like she failed as a parent, the fact that I get jealous of other people's mothers already shows how much she failed at it.

I told her I never asked to be born, I was her mistake, she should've just aborted me, she should have just killed me, and yes I did try to attempt it on Mother's Day but I chickened out the last minute. She feeds me, gave me clothes and shelter? Isn't that because she'll face child abuse and neglect if she didn't do all that? And it's not her that did any of that stuff, it's only my dad that is working hard just to provide me those things, and it's only my dad who places any effort towards me. My dad tells me to apologize to her for making her cry the whole night on mother's day, but I can't bring myself to do it.  I don't even know if she loves me or not, she never made me feel loved but she tells me everything I said makes her feel heartbroken. She probably loves me but just someone who is full of flaws, but it doesn't excuse her abuse towards me. Tell me, am I such a bad person to make their mother cry on mother's day? Should I apologize to her? But I don't think she even wants to talk to me."

i also feel guilty for being so depressed when i have such an amazing person so close to me in my life. the depression isnt fully gone when he is here. and it makes me feel horrible because i love him so much and he is the best thing to ever happen to me yet i am depressed.
it also made me realize how alone i am. how little people have love for me. i mean i knew, it just hit differently now. i cut off my toxic family. i currently dont really have friends. probably my fault. i used to have friends. i dont know what friendships are anymore. i changed and want friendships differently that before. these things dont bother me at all usually. but idk it just hits me because my boyfriend has friends and and his family. don’t get me wrong im very very grateful for him. so grateful. but i kinda also feel like a failure and useless and like nobody, non worthy or lovable etc.
please someone say something, i haven’t poured my heart out like this in a very long time."

I'm appreciative of the love and positive vibes in an otherwise dark world I live in. I wonder how long before the love bombing ends or they figure out I am not all in on the religion though.

kSharp93,depression,1620645066.0,I’m stuck in a horrible cycle and my mental health is rapidly deteriorating,"I’m sad. I’m so fucking sad. I spent the entire day in bed yesterday from start to finish and I want to just stay. I hate my job and it’s definitely a huge contributing factor to my depression. However, I’m worried how it’ll look on a resume for me to quit after 5 months. I only have an associates degree and a long history of restaurant work and about 2 years in legal clerical work. My current job being a receptionist at a law firm and my previous being a courtroom clerk at the county courthouse. I actually liked the courthouse job but they pay so horribly I couldn’t stick around anymore. This job I have now is fine but it is INSANELY uninteresting. Like holy shit. The days go by painfully slow because there isn’t enough to do and what there is to do is so boring I can barely focus on it. This puts me more in my head because I don’t have work to distract me and I’m left “looking busy” and staring at the clock. I hate it and it just isn’t for me. However, because of my limited experience, I can’t find another white collar job where I’m being paid the same or more with benefits. I’m considering just saying screw the benefits and going back to serving tables just so I can not be completely miserable while I’m trying to find something else, but I feel like it’s a bad move. I don’t want to compromise my mental health for a job but I need to think about my life. I obviously need to get back in therapy. I have an appointment set at the end of the month. Cant be in therapy without fucking benefits. So I just feel super stuck. I gotta move in a week and need to buy furniture and my savings is limited. I’m stuck.  I’m very very close to losing my mind. I just want time to myself. But I can’t because my life is ruled by money and fucking health benefits. What a joke. I’m gonna lose it. I’m considering bringing my situation to my boss and asking for a layoff so I can at least have unemployment for a little bit while I work on getting better and finding more suitable work but I don’t know if that’s wrong to ask. I don’t know what to do."

I know covid has made it hard for everyone. We struggled to pay rent and keep food on the table. I used all my savings and stimulus for food and rent. I started to experience health issues during covid but i had lost my health insurance because I couldn't pay it after losing my job, due to covid. I knew I couldn't see a doctor I couldn't afford it. Then it got to the point where I just had to talk to a doctor, there were no in person meetings only telephone call. Every call charged me 450$ but luckily there was some financial assitance so I only owed 180$ after every call. But those phone calls just had me going around in circles, taking the same tests never finding anything and still experiencing symptoms. My doctor told me to go Urgent care if my symptoms got worse. About 2 months later they did, I asked my girlfriend to take me to the hospital so I can go into the urgent care to get checked out. This was my only option, because there is no in person doctor appointments. As I was walking in I vomited all over myself, and nearly loss consciousness. I was helped inside by a nurse and they drew blood. In my already weakened state the blood draw had me passing out, I couldn't breathe. This was the first time I ever experienced when drawing blood. They put me in the ER and did all these tests I already did. They couldn't find anything. Now I'm stuck with a nearly  $10k medical bill when I just want to know whats wrong and I still don't know.

Rolls_,depression,1620458002.0,Losing hope,"This is kinda a long story but imma try to keep it short. Basically tho, I'm quickly losing hope and don't see a point. Don't feel like I'm really meant for this world.

&#x200B;

About 6yrs ago, I told myself I would end it in 5 years if I didn't improve my life. I succeeded. Got rid of social anxiety and normal anxiety, made friends, improved my grade to a 3.9 gpa in Uni and am now graduating. Didn't fix the depression and now I just have more stuff to get depressed over.

Recently, got rejected from a program that would have me work over seas. I asked my best friend out a couple months ago, got rejected. Became much better friends after that though. later, found out she has a thing for an old hs friend that lives out of state, and a vacation we planned together was in large part so she can hook up with this friend. So, I'm no longer going to do that trip.

I have a lot of other stuff going on, but those are some things I had hope for recently. This year I gave myself a hard deadline for when I would finally end it, created a plan, everything. Decided to do it after graduation, so a couple weeks from now. Unfortunately tho, my friend convinced me to stick around for a while (I opened up to her about my depression after we started getting really close. Asshole thing to do, I know). Now I can't even connect to that suicidal part of me. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Planned on ending things, finally gave myself a hard deadline. So many things I was looking forward to turned out bad. Worst part is my friend convinced me to not kms. Now I just have to live with this shit until I get that feeling back. No longer see the point."

goddamn__goddamn,depression,1620499754.0,Worried abt meds making me feel numb when I already do...?,"I'm unsure of where to turn, but I think I've been depressed my whole life and just never realized? Most of my friends who are depressed are suicidal or experience very deep lows, and since I have none of that I never thought I could be depressed.

I just have a steady lack of desire to do anything, plus insomnia, plus an almost nonexistent sex drive the past few years. No interest in cooking or feeding myself (but I really do like food). I haven't had extreme emotions one way or the other in  a long, long time, I feel pretty steady, it's just a steady....apathy. Like things can still make me laugh, but I rarely cry or feel anything too deeply. I've lost a few friends over the past two years and I might cry for a minute or two when I find out but then I'm almost over it already? I've even sat with a friends body for 2 days during a home funeral and I was the only one not crying.

I also have ADHD and want to try meds finally (I'm 31) but I worry about all the stories I hear of folks feeling numb. And I know some ppl like that cause it feels like the fog of doom has lifted for them, but I don't need that. I need motivation. To do anything, literally I'd settle for motivation to shower more or cook breakfast.

Anyone have depression that's relatable and has been on meds successfully for it?"

It may not sound bad but I’m sick of being a husk of a person. I’ve rejected so many opportunities to be better in life and hardly cared about what I used to be good at when I was a child. I’m uninterested in just about everything and it’s always been this way. I’ve been trying to ignore negative thoughts but it only builds up. I wouldn’t say I’ve done enough to better myself in the grand scheme of potential solutions but there’s a subtle and lingering thought in the back of my head that just wants me dead now."

She told me that I could be honest about how I feel. I started opening up about my feelings with her and I really was feeling again and experiencing some of the emotions that I have been repressing in a way that I haven’t before. It’s like the flood gates were open and I started pouring myself out. Right as I was starting to adjust to the newfound comfort of finally have one person that I could be honest with, she told me that it was too much, and that I was draining. I understand that it’s a lot for someone to bear. I even told her that she wouldn’t be able to handle it. She disagreed. Now I’m finding myself in a worse place than I was before.

TryingMyBest69420,depression,1620432974.0,Psych told me I have depression but I don't feel depressed?,"So, first thing to note: I have been diagnosed with depression before and am on meds to manage it and OCD, but I only really had one major depressive episode years ago. I went on meds immediately afterwards and I haven't felt that depression related level of misery and sadness since. I had a really major OCD episode years ago that also resulted in me feeling that miserable, but that was due to the intrusive thoughts I was having so it wasn't necessarily a depression thing.

So, I've been on meds for depression and OCD for years now and I've always felt that it was well managed and the depression/OCD was basically gone? I almost always feel neutral/calm and often experience happiness at points during the day a lot of days and when I'm with family/friends. Sometimes I'll have passive suicidal thoughts, but that's only in reaction to stressful situations (often concerning my future and academics) and I've never thought of it as a big deal.

For a while (years) now, I've noticed myself struggling with a lot of things though. I easily get distracted when doing chores and work, forget things way more than other people, have a lot of trouble even initiating important everyday tasks (like eating consistently, hygiene, getting out of bed), feel tired ALL the time, etc. Completing large projects and tasks is especially difficult for me, even when I understand the content it is based on, and feels like too much brainpower and I get distracted with other things even when I WANT to complete it. This all got so severe that I had to withdraw from the semester b/c I just couldn't DO anything, couldn't do any work or eat consistently or get out of bed consistently or anything bc it just felt like too much effort or I couldn't focus on it for long. But through it all I never felt the level of misery/sadness/hopelessness I had known to be from depression.

So I searched it up, thought I might have inattentive adhd b/c I wasn't experiencing any feelings of being depressed and my inability to function was severe, saw a psych to get tested only to be told I actually show high markers for depression and OCD, which I had thought was so well managed by my meds that it was basically nonexistent. I'm so frustrated bc how can I still be displaying depression when I don't even feel depressed? I even asked my mom, who I live with bc my college is online for the semester, if I've seemed depressed and she said no. Shouldn't my depression meds have helped with my executive dysfunction if it is depression related? I'm just frustrated and confused right now."
Emzstuff,depression,1620646973.0,Covid has ruined my life and I no longer know what to do with myself.,"Long story short, I lost my job last year in August.   
It was a job I had worked 5 years at and had hoped could be my career and it was something I was doing well in. Due to it being in the creative industry, sadly my role had to be furloughed and I couldn't work from home. At first, I was okay with this, but after a few months of being furloughed, I started to worry, I was asking my manager if my job was ok and was constantly being told 'Your job is fine'. But after one week of being told that, I was made redundant.   
And since then I've struggled in finding work or a job I can keep. I got myself a job in November 2020 which I was super happy about and it sadly lasted up until mid-January as the situation repeated itself and I lost that job due to the UK going into another lockdown.   
Every day since January, I've been applying for jobs, looking for any type of work, but work where it of course pays a decent living amount as I have bills to pay.

I've now gotten to that point where I no longer know what I want to do with myself. I'm 28 and I know I'm not the only one in this situation. But I sit here now and just feel useless. Because I had originally had a decent job, not had to worry about a lot, had moved out, and started to really feel like things were working out for me after fighting for so much. And now it's all changed in one year. I get rejected for jobs I fit. I've gone and taken classes to build my confidence up when it comes to interviews as I now lack confidence and have developed Anxiety. I've had my CV looked at and changed so many times. I've applied for courses or apprenticeships in hopes I can maybe develop my skills so it gets easier when applying for jobs. The government's UC doesn't support as much as they make out to and throw any old job at you.

And now my family's become un-supportive too. I've noticed any job I apply for which has something in it which I've not done before or something I haven't got a lot of experience in, my family automatically judge me for it and say: ""'Oh can you cope"" or ""You don't have the skills for that"". And it makes me feel utter rubbish because when I apply I put so much effort into it all and feel confident about myself, that when they say those things I then feel I won't be successful. My mums even started saying things like: ""Oh now I need to go get a job just to support you as you can't get one"".

I'm writing this just so I don't feel alone really. And in hopes, others are in the same situation.I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried recruitment agencies, but they throw jobs I don't wish to do at me or find jobs in locations I can't even get to without it costing me a lot. I'm at that point it's not worth fighting for anymore. I no longer have the money to travel to jobs further out. My family says they are supportive, but when I ask for the support they don't give it. I just feel covid has truly messed my life up.

Any advice on things I can do to not feel this way would be great. One step I've taken is that I've applied to volunteer at local places near me just to get out there again and to gain my confidence back. But job-wise and things, I don't know what to do anymore.

Thanks for reading."
-justkeepsmiling-,depression,1620446908.0,Boyfriend wants to breakup because i’m always sad,"TW: rape


Backstory:
About 2.5 months ago, I was raped by a guy I met at a party. Me and my boyfriend were broken up at the time for a few weeks and had just started talking as friends again that week. After it happened, I was broken and suicidal and stayed with him most of the time while dealing with the initial shock of it all. During that time, I realized I still had romantic feelings for him and we began dating again after a little. 

The current situation:
Yesterday my boyfriend and I had a talk where he was really close to breaking up with me. I’ve been dealing with an investigation into the rape which has made me fall back into a depressive hole. He said that since I’m sad all the time, it’s affecting him negatively and stressing him out. He said he thinks I’m ok with being upset and he feels like a caregiver to me. It takes so much effort for me to even get out of bed and go about my day but I don’t know how to fix this. He’s been my biggest support through this and I don’t want to lose him. I’m seeing a therapist and trying my best to heal and be happy but it’s felt almost impossible lately. I don’t want him to be stressed and sad because of me, but I don’t want to break up with him.

Any advice or anything would be helpful because I feel completely lost on what the right thing to do is at this point."

Since face to face classes stopped, It's gotten so much worse. I lay down in bed all day reading manga and drawing. I get days where I randomly start feeling like shit so I go to sleep to avoid thinking about it. It also makes me lose interest in the only two things that I do so I just sleep some more.  It makes me feel empty and extremely lonely.  I'm very sensitive so just a bit of rejection could make me cry. I cry a lot but just in the bathroom tho.

My aunt has really bad BPD and I'm pretty sure my mom has some mental issues that she has never really looked into or even realized. She's mentally immature and unstable. Being raised by her has caused me to have low self-esteem and bad communication skills.

I wanna know what's wrong with me so I've done some online quizzes for depression. It always says that I have real bad depression but of course it's just an online quiz so I'm not jumping to conclusions.

Should I go get checked up? I don't wanna tell my mom unless I'm confident about it. I know she's gonna think I'm overreacting."

I was always struggling with anxiety. I was quiet. The weird kid. I realise now it was anxiety. Later I gained depression as well.

In 2000 my Nan died. I was very young. Just nine years old. She died of cancer. She was misdiagnosed and they thought it was gall stones. Nope. Cancer. She died in her 60's. I loved her to bits. I still do, actually. I miss her.

That was the first loss I had.

Growing up I was bullied a lot. I'm skinny, so naturally was a target for bullies. I was slapped. Punched. Called names like ""anorexic"", ""gollum"" ... I'd accidentally brush past people in the school corridors and they'd say ""ew it touched you!"". School sucked. I had a best friend who would bully me and steal my food.

When I was in high-school my bedroom caught fire. My brother and I had been arguing about something - at the time our relationship wasn't the best - and I stormed outside. It was a good job I did, because not long after my brother came running outside saying there was a fire. I lost most of my teddies, clothes, bed, belongings, and my little pet hamster. 

I got a boyfriend. And then that boyfriend decided to assault someone with a hammer and then reveal he was on the run from the police. Excellent.

I left school with shredded self-esteem and no self-confidence.

We were in trouble as a family with bailiffs. My dad borrowed money off someone who may or may not have been a loan shark just to make ends meet. Eventually he fell behind payments. We had people coming into the house taking down the value of all of our items in case my dad couldn't pay and they had to repossess things. I found letters growing up - accidentally while looking for other things - that were summoning my dad to court for rent arrears.

My mum was an emotional wreck. She had terrifying tempers and threatened us with violence. She'd smash things. Throw things. Shout at us. Blame my dad that everything went wrong. Take off her wedding ring and throw it across the room.

When I went into Uni things were OK-ish. I graduated with a BSc.

I went on a date with another ex from school. He wanted sex. He tried to do ""things"" with me, but couldn't get turned on. He broke up with me afterwards.

After Uni I didn't get the job I wanted. Signed on JobSeekers. My brother moved away to Scotland to live with his then-girlfriend. My dad worked late nights. My mum was absorbed with her computer. I was essentially alone. I was on minimum wage and couldn't move out because I couldn't afford it.

My granddad died, which was a horrible experience for several reasons. For the obvious, and also because he hated my dad. And in turn most of the family on my mum's side hated us too. We were made to feel like we weren't welcome at the funeral. While all my cousins rode behind the hearse, we were stuck in a hire car trying to find somewhere to park. By the time we got to the church the service was over.

I still didn't find a job I really wanted. And when I was stuck in a call-centre job, I came home one night and my mum told me we were moving. We'd been evicted.

I remember one night my dad went out to get drunk. He came home and broke down entirely, crying onto my shoulder. I remember he also reached out for my mum - she pushed him away. I was left to comfort him. He'd done all he could to stop our family being evicted. He'd worked so damn hard. And it happened. My mum didn't comfort him because he was drunk. But I know he was just lost. I just comforted him. And I admit I broke down too.

We didn't have long to clear the house, so as a result a lot of our childhood memories were left behind. That last night was so surreal when we went there for the last time to leave the keys.

We moved into a place run by a dodgy landlord. It had been an illegal HMO - house of multiple occupancy - which meant it previously had a lot of families living there. They all moved out before we got there, so we were the only family living there. But the landlord was a family friend who saved us from being homeless.

It was a shithole. Cigarette butts everywhere. Chewing gum stuck to walls. A cellar still full of all their old junk. The roof leaked when it rained.

I went to the doctors and was put on anti-depressants for the first time, but they made me feel so ill I just stopped taking them.

I moved on from the call centre job. But honestly, I was so miserable at that point, that I spent way too much time drinking. I'd isolate myself in my room. My mum would joke she never saw anything of me. And it was true. I gave up trying to socialise with her when all she did was stare at her computer all night. So I just stayed alone.

Eventually my brother got a new girlfriend. He actually asked me to move in with him - in Scotland - just to see if I could settle and get a job etc. So I agreed. It was great. We'd hang out, laugh, sometimes drink a little too much, but it was good. We're good friends so it was nice to finally have some release.

After several months I got a job and enough money to make my own way. I was finally able to bring my dog up from down South to live with me. Which was awesome. Of course, things went wrong again.

I was in a job where I now realise my manager wanted rid of me but didn't have any real reason to sack me. So, he palmed me off with a store transfer, promising me more hours and a solid schedule. Of course, the manager at the other store had no idea about the full-time hours and set rota. He was furious at my old manager.

I went for a walk with my dog one night and was just so overwhelmed. I stood by a sea wall considering jumping. I was making a plan for how best to ensure my dog got to safety. He jumped up, put his front paws on the wall, and gave me a look which said: ""Don't you dare, human"". I sat down on a bench and cried into his neck-fluff.

I quit and got a job at the same shop my brother worked at (Same company but different location), but when they sacked my brother over bogus claims I too eventually quit (I got on well with the people, but it felt wrong working under someone who had sacked my brother over something that was BS). And anyway. I wanted a better paying job.

My niece was born. I drove my sister-in-law to the hospital while she was in labour. But this was at the start of the first lockdown - I was unable to see her properly. It felt like I was so involved and then suddenly very isolated as I was unable to visit my brother. Unable to see my niece. I had no friends. No other family. No-one but my dog.

I ended up being completely useless at the new job and got sacked. I was unemployed for about 3 months and living off benefits. I hit rock-bottom. I spent too much drinking. I slept for days at a time without eating. I even went on a random 1am walk with my dog for about 8 miles and came home with bloodied, blistered feet. I spent Christmas not even being able to buy a first present for my niece. I felt like a useless aunt.

I eventually got another job in a factory working at an agency, and my hours got cut down to just 2 days a week which wasn't enough to pay rent. I was stressed out

I got a new job, which is where I am now. It's a factory again. My co-workers are toxic. The work is repetitive. Every day feels like same.

I got signed off work for two weeks. Diagnosed with anxiety along with depression. Put on new medication.

I'm meant to be off for another two weeks, but have to go back tomorrow because my sick pay will not cover my bills.

I am not OK."

letsgetitstartedinha,depression,1620630996.0,What do you do when your usual coping mechanisms stop working?,"TW: eating disorders

I was feeling happy for so long, but  I'd occasionally get anxiety because being happy for a long period of time seems suspicious after so many years of going through depression. Pretty much just always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I know it's a barrier so it won't be as devastating after the next bad thing happens so you can always be prepared. I finally, **FINALLY** talked myself out of it at one point to where I stopped always waiting for something terrible to happen and just let it all go and have a more positive outlook. 

Then, of course, not too long after I was *extremely* caught off guard by my bestfriend/ ex saying something my previous ex would always say which is saying that they regret meeting me and wouldn't have wasted their time if they knew about my past early on. It's made me think back to every fight, disagreement, or difficult time that I had with them and it won't stop replaying in my head.

I keep going back and forth between anger and sadness. Anger at people begging me to open up to them just so they can judge me for it and also angry at myself for being vulnerable. 

Ive struggled with bulimia on and off since 2009 when I was in highschool. I haven't binged and purged in 3 ½ years now, but I'm really struggling with trying not to start again. I have GERD from doing it for so long so I've taken medication for it every day since 2018. For the past week, I really haven't eaten much and I have had the worst heartburn so I feel like my body is subconsciously telling me not to b/p because, if I do, it'll make it 100x worse. My heart is hurting in both the physical and emotional sense. I've avoided eating all day because I feel like I am just going to relapse if I do. For those who don't know, bulimia has a lot to do with control issues.

Ive cried more times in the past few weeks than I have in probably the last year. It has been so long since I've felt like this and my usual coping mechanisms are not helping and I can't make the thoughts or the crying stop. My insomnia is back because of it.

abb3yr0ad,depression,1620577531.0,Just venting,"I (25F) don’t want to resent my (18F) sister but I just keep messing up with her. I want to get out of this negative mindset and documenting my thoughts somehow may help. I can’t let her words get to me. I’m just so exhausted. So exhausted of the mental gymnastics I have to do with her. She says that I’m a terrible bitch and don’t deserve anything good in this life. I know words are just words but I feel like she’s starting to believe it. I don’t want to go on living like this. 

I don’t want to resent my parents but they’re checked out with taking care of her. So now I have to be the sister AND the parent. I can’t ever just be the sister because if I was, I’d probably be a better support system. Over time, it’s become hard for me to empathize with her because I always feel like I am on the other side of the situation, rather than on her side. Lately it’s been hard for us to get along because I always seem to infuriate her over something small. She says that I’m basically overthinking the wrong things - that if I had just done this or that, etc. everything would’ve been fine or she wouldn’t be as mad. My parents created this person. They enabled these behaviors and now I have to bear the brunt of it. I don’t want to feel any more sorry for myself than I already do because it’ll just make me spiral and I’ll keep thinking negatively. She always says not to focus on her insults but instead use it as motivation to change, but she doesn’t understand my depression. My depression seemingly now has been a huge burden on everyone because they’re just waiting on me to change. I’m tired. I’m mentally and physically exhausted. 

My aunt gave me a way out which is to stay with her for a few days each week to keep her and my grandma company. I know this is my anxiety talking but I just know my sister will be mad that I get this reprieve and she doesn’t. More and more, I can feel how much she resents me but I have to be the one to fix the wrongs and I’m TIRED man.

Now I think about taking myself out of the equation completely but I know it’s just ideation. I need to get out of this mindset because it’s preventing me from doing the things I need to do. I know I have to take it day by day but right now I’m literally just trying to make it to the end of each day. I always thought doing that was enough but now it isn’t because everyone is waiting on me to change.

I don't even know what he did for a living. I honestly can't tell you why my parents wanted children.  It seemed they hated all of us. I got married at 30 to someone I didn't love because I was getting old and wanted kids. I had three children and I thought though I knew I wasn't happy, at least I was content. I talked to people but they were mostly parents of my kids and my husband's friends. It all caught up with me at about 40. I realized I was unhappy and didn't love my husband. I tried to kill myself, was locked up and that was the end of the life as I knew it. I lost all my friends, my husband, and my children think of me as an embarrassment. My therapist dropped me and I never could trust another person. The truth is, I really don't care. I don't understand why any of us want to live in this world anyway. I sometimes think everyone else who ISN'T depressed is just deluding themselves anyway. With all the suffering and hate that goes around, why on earth would anyone want to live? Yes, I know.

I don’t mean pleasure in a moment here or a moment there. Those moments are attainable, but real existential happiness is not. My issues run deep, to early early childhood. I’ve never known anything but this. And now I have been diagnosed with borderline. It’s just unrealistic to think that I can ever be free of these things. That’s not how life works. The issues that you face don’t just magically disappear, they must be solved, and with mental health, YOU are the only one who can solve them. I’ve tried, for over a decade and a half now to solve them, and it just hasn’t happened. 

I can’t throw in the towel and just kill myself though. That would not be fair to my mom and dad. They really really love me, and I owe it to them to at least live. So I am stuck living a life that I can never be happy in. What do I do? Well, there are still people who I care about, so what if I work for their happiness? My goose is cooked. Theirs is not.

I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and had reached a teetering point.  Without unpacking to much, I've been terrible at making decisions for myself often just being pushed into a choice or indecision takes the opportunity away.  I have gotten most of an associate's horticulture and spent the last 5 years being a yesman and working my way up to be terminated last June for ""covid"" reasons.  I'm doing everything I can think of to find employment with equal or greater pay outside landscaping.  
6 months before that I had to leave the home I was staying in so the landlords kid and grandkids had a place to stay, I don't blame them I would have done the same thing for my kid. Now me ,my SO and child live in the basement of a family members house and they have been a blessing.

I have a family that I want to take care of and a special needs child that has made tremendous improvements since I lost my job.  I've been hyper focused on them and have developed a love for being a homemaker of sorts.  This only adds to my avoidance of gainful employment.
My head begins to physically hurt when I try to sort my thoughts.  Another huge issue I have is that we are above poverty from an income stand point however life happens and my debt to income ratio for the last ten years has made it impossible for me to get ahead. Often times having to put off a bill to pay a more important one or even buy groceries.  

I'm lost and can't see a direction that will pull me out of my hurdles.  I don't know how to bring in money while working with my childs development and my own roadblocks. 
I apologize if this seems unorganized or a ramble, I'm struggling even to post this.

ExoSierra,depression,1620447351.0,I usually lurk here,"Had a long history of depression and suicidal ideations. I’ve been living alone the past 9 months and I’ve never felt more lonely. I’ve made friends here at school but I only see them during the day and sometimes when we go out at night. 

I’ve had a few girls enter and leave my life so whenever they are around I feel fine for the time being. Eventually though they all leave my life when they become disinterested and I go back to a lonely existence of binge watching shows and playing video games. I’m healthy, I exercise and I’m competent socially but I’m still an introvert at heart. 

Not a day goes by that I don’t have suicidal ideations. Even when I have a good day where nothing goes wrong, at the end of the day when I’m in bed I just have an empty and hollow feeling in my chest. Having a companion to fall asleep next to is a temporary pick me up but nothing good ever lasts in my life and that only usually happens once a week if I’m lucky or if they have time for me.

I don’t even know what I’m trying to accomplish by posting here, just trying to put my thoughts down somewhere. 

I’m just tired of being tired. Why is it so difficult to be happy even when things in my life are going objectively well? 

I feel like even 20 years from now I’ll still carry this great sadness with me and it’ll never leave me alone. I feel lost and alone."
snoopman420,depression,1620464077.0,I feel very upset over this series that I watched:,"Alright, well this may sound really stupid compared to other much more serious problems out there on this subreddit,  but the other day I started this short anime (Tsuki Ga Kiwei), a typical school romance. The anime wasn’t amazing but I felt like I could _actually_ feel the love there, which I think is stupid since they’re practically drawings. Anyway, ever since I finished that series, I’ve just felt downright weird and terrible about myself. The main character bonds with a girl and now I’ve realised that I just really want someone thats there for me. I also feel like i’ve wasted my teen years, i’m 17, still a virgin and never had girlfriend and now I’m feeling worse about the fact I went to an all-boys school. 
I’ve started to realise that I cannot watch anything under the romance genre, I instantly feel upset especially when its something about high school love or teen romance. I just wish I could experience actually having a crush on someone, but I’ve barely interacted with women or girls my age. I just want to flip a switch that would take me back to when I was 13"

123blueskies,depression,1620593698.0,"Another Saturday night, me with my thoughts. And the loneliness that never slows down.","Saturday night:

 Another moment to think thoughts for myself.
 Fatigue kills, and confusion is here.  But I'm in my bed thinking.

 And I knew how to think, decipher and understand.  But today and now it's like a heavy fog with no horizon.  It's hard for me to see beyond, it's hard for me to think deeply.  I feel superficial.

 It's like a sea of ​​information with surging waves, and she comes closer and understands and the love grows.  But I am in confusion, from a moment of fear to love.  And I sink into thought.

 Hot here, feeling dry, as if like such smoke blocking the field of vision.  It's hard to live here, well, I know that.  But the main thing is at least I type my thoughts?

 But I'm not in focus, diligence ceases, I feel dead slowly and the direction runs out.  I was flooded with a sea of ​​information, which everyone accepts.  But my muscles have stopped working.

 I was inundated with advertisements, varied opinions, and the bundled troubles that await in every corner.  And it's hard here to understand, it's hard to absorb at all, there's no reason in the world to think, and no less.

 I feel emptiness, but such real, empty of purpose but like something narrow, like empty music, like out-of-love love, and like environmental loneliness.

 My self is extinct, and it feels lost to me.  How can I live in such a miserable world.  My inner self dominated, it was always there, hobby, after hobby.  And here I am lying alone like a liquid on floors, a small mistake of something that was broken into pieces.  And without displacement.

 I knew, but I'm tired of knowing again.  My mind thought, and thoughts like nothing.

 Now it remains to be calm, rested and rested, to pass another day that comes suddenly, and to live in an obscure reality.  And the main thing is to understand or learn, the factory will continue to work.
 I will live in it.  I will study it, and the main thing is to finish.

 Hope I'm still here, my self must not disappear from me.

  It's scary."

EndZestyclose990,depression,1620612407.0,I feel like I made all the wrong choices,"I had the chance to have access to an education and I blew it. My depression was at it’s absolute max back in high school, and I honestly don’t think I would’ve made it out as a whole (also was in a terribly toxic « relationship »), but it could’ve opened me so many doors ? 

I (20F) used to have so many dreams and ambitions yet the only one that seems somewhat reachable now is to find happiness at some point. I wanted to work in the animation industry or the cinema, burned myself really bad; (Working from 8am to 8am of the next day with 24h sleep in between) so now I have to learn how to appreciate what I dedicated my life to again.

Absolutely love space, stupid as a wall when it comes to math.

It may sound absolutely dramatic since I’m only 20, but everything moves SO FAST and I can’t keep up. I see people going forward in life, being happy in their craft, being hella talented, and I’ve just been a depressed fuck for the last 10 years. 
A year ago I was still considered/treated like a child, and now I have to make decisions that are out of my reach. Do I find a random job for food money and closet appartement ? Do I pursue in art/cinema, but then what if I burn myself again and for good ? Couldn’t live with that. What if I’m not good enough ? (I’m not) Should I start over in an other country ? Should I go back in school ? (I emotionally and financially can’t) I could marry rich but you gotta be good looking for that lol. 

I hardly have any energy to get out of bed, even less to get any work done. (I have 2 short films to yet work on)

I don't think I'm extremely unattractive. But I'm finding that there aren't as many people like me in this city as I thought there would be. And I still miss my ex so fucking much. I loved them.

Saile_858,depression,1620623596.0,I feel like I'm at the top bottom of my life and don't have no one to ask for help,"I finally reached my limit. My life is a total failiure and not even my family knows or cares about it. 

I grew up in something that started like a normal 4-people family but rapidly turned into a mess. When I was 15-yo my mom was diagnosed with stage IV medular cancer, six months later she passed away. Instantly after my mom's dead, everything was going to fuck from bad to worse. 

My father has always been very strict non-talkative dad, there's no dad jokes, there's no dad-son moments since I was 16, a few months after my mom's funeral. My relationship with my dad was never close, but it grew up on distance even more trough the years. Nowadays we barely salute each other.

My mom died in Jan-2013, 8 years ago. Since that moment I had to learn everything about life quickly and alone. Despite my dad didn't abandon me, his figure has been quite absent in my path trough life, like I said before. As a mid-teenager I had to learn alone about cooking, cleanning, house shopping and personal finance, all along my studies and university admissions results ahead.

I feel I did well those first months, I made up a seat for study electrical engineering on college, later found my first gf and made a new life going to church. But 2 years later, in 2015, everything fucked up again. I had to drop college for 2 semesters, lost my first gf, lost all my friends, no money, disfunctional family. My motivation for life was starting to fall. During the 2 semesters I was out from college, I tried to find some certifications in terms of looking for a good revenue job like CCNA or AutoCAD. I was able to finish CCNA but I couldn't afford certification exam at the moment. I didn't care much about it because I was starting uni a few weeks later.

In 2016 I started uni for second time. I was still studying EE and had to retake some subjects to catch up my pensum. I feel like I was doing great, those 2 semesters I was able to recover and find love for what I was studying. Later, in 2017 I met my 2nd gf and instantly my life was taking it's first steps for a second more-deeper sinking.

My dad never agreed with my choices, but never gave me wisdom either at least. We always had fights  for everyting I made or didn't made and rapidly had to become used to be called 'a total failiure' by him. But in the other hand he is totaly pleasant and lacks of discipline with my sister, wich is 2 years younger than me. When I started my second relationship while I was on my 20's, my fights with my dad turned less frequent because my gf's family were friends of him from church when they were teens. I thought this would be helpful but the more the time passed, the more that dream became a nightmare.

2017 and 2018 were the most detestable years of my life. 2017 is caracterized by all the shitty political situation that hit harder Venezuela in that year due the fall of oil prices, and 2018 is remembered by me for all the humilliations that I recieved from the shitty people of my ex gf family. I was failling on college, had no money, had little or no food at all, problems with my dad, problems with my gf and her family, suffered from bully made by her parents (they were used to tell me that my dad was right calling me a failiure, even were used to compare me with other son-on-law of them). I was willing to die. Meanwhile, my gf's parents recover touch with a friend of theirs who knew my dad by those same years. She was a 50yo divorced woman who was close to them and quickly added to the group. In december of 2018 she and my dad maried making everything worse.

In May 2019 I found my first job. It wasn't my dream job but was a dreamed-first-job. I started as an junior consultant on a little IT company, was a half-time schedule that allowed me to take some college subjets on mornings and going to office on noons. Payment wasn't glory but was a gamechanger for me. I was very happy and thanking God for such an opportunity despite was something that I don't like at all wich is programming but, as is known, 'beggars can't be choosers'. No one agreed nor celebrated me. My dad said that I should had focused more on college, my gf and her family said that it would be problematic since I was reducing the time I spent with their daugther and many other shit. A few months later my dad and his wife decided to move appart, leaving me and my sister living by ourselves. That didn't surprised me, and I tried to take it as a booster. A couple months later, my gf and I broke up... Sincerely was the most painful relationship in my life. I was submited into sadness because I was all alone, felt like was totally abandoned. I was failling at uni, living with a disfunctional family, leaving a painful toxic long term relationship, with no friends and very little money.

I tried to overcome the end of that relationship trying to focus even more on college, working harder and looking for met some new people. It worked for about 4 months until coivd hit and pandemic started. Instantly everything went down, I stopped college (again but this time wasn't my fault and this feels the most frustrating), I stopped meeting new people (since everyone new I met was in college and church, this is a correlated from last one), I lost all contact with the few acquaintances I had (my terrible social skills and lack of close friends along my grow made me take the wrong decision of doing a social shutdown and stoped talking with some people I was used to), work became heavier from home and all my stress and frustration doesn't motivate me at all. I'm willing to quit but I don't wanna do it yet. I became lazier because I don't left home as I was used to, before pandemics I walked about 10 km by day because I liked to walk from college to work and after from work to home. 

Now, I'm here feeling like a total failiure. I'm 24 and I'm thinking about drop shcool but this time definetely and changing for a totally new career like economics, I'm about to quit my job because I don't like it at all, I dropped church, social media, hobbies, meaning of life, I dropped every effort of doing something life-valuable. I stopped enjoying life so much long ago that I dream with a new fresh start. I'm scared. I'm totally unmotivated. I'm frustrated with me, with my life, with my freacking hell-maker bad choices looking how the people that graduated with me from high school is now living their lifes while I'm here being miserable because of my own fault. I wish I had seen all the red flags trough my life.

I wrote all this because I needed to steam off. I know this won't finish my missery but I have no one else to tell how I feel. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to quit my job, I'm scared of how they can react. I'm scared of making another terrible choice... I have finally collapsed"

I want to make a SAAS app for  mental health professionals to help them schedule sessions/appointments with patients/clients. It would have the following features :

1. Easy of use, Simple Cloud-based booking/scheduling of time-slots
2. Automatic Zoom/Google Meet link generation (will be sent to both client and doctor)
3. Automatic Reminders to both client and doctor
4. Ability for the client to reschedule by choosing open slot from the doctor's timetable without discussing with doctor
5. A little AI that will help predict when slots might be open, and notify you to try and fill them

The pain-point I'm trying to address and possibly solve is that a lot of time goes wasted in deciding a time, setting up the meeting and sending the link across. All of these could be easily automated.

Would professionals be willing to use a service like this? (Say for 10$ a month?)

Do you already use a service like this? Can you point me in the right direction?

These-Yogurtcloset85,depression,1620479450.0,Entrepreneur boyfriend (29M) who I suspect is chronically depressed thinks he wants to break up with me (29F) after 4 years - is it just the depression talking or do I let him go?,"I know this is an extremely long read but I would really appreciate any advice fellow people with experience dating depressed entrepreneurs might have.

My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 4 years, of which the last 1.5 years has been on and off long distance (I went away to grad school). The first 3 years of our relationship was amazing, happy, and healthy. One thing that always loomed over our relationship though was that my boyfriend was just starting a business and he was struggling immensely with the burden, pressure, and slow success of it. I was a big support system for him during this struggle but he would get so depressed at times that he would admit to having contemplated suicide. It was very difficult to support him during this time and I eventually convinced him to speak to someone routinely, although he ended up going with a life coach rather than a therapist.

After I left to grad school 1.5 years ago, and things were fine for the first 6 months or so but I could tell some resentment was building because - even though he was incredibly supportive about my decision to go - my boyfriend felt abandoned and alone and was going through the same daily grind every day. We were still in the same time zone though and talked every day and I still did my utmost to support him and we were luckily still about to see each other every 6-8 weeks for the first 9 months or so. When COVID hit though, I ended up moving back with him for 6 months. This is when I think things began to be more strained because the built up resentment and fear of abandonment had started to create walls between us. I could tell things were not the same between us anymore - he was fearful of the future, he lashed out and was more irritable, nothing excited him anymore, it was a struggle to ever get him to do anything fun or adventurous, he never took initiative, and he became more self-centred. I attributed it to his depression and tried to be available to support him but the change in his behaviour towards me was hurtful and so we also fought more than we used to, and not as well as we used to. Although in the past I used to be able to help him through his depression, he started to stonewall me more now. We had a few conversations about our struggles but nothing that really translated into a change in behaviour. During one of these conversations, he explicitly expressed that he was feeling pressure and not ready for marriage or kids which I had said I was okay with (and was and still am). We spent 6 months in this somewhat rocky situation but I left again when we were on good terms.

My second year of grad school was in London and I moved there September 2020. The time difference between London and back home is 5 hours which made it more difficult to have substantial conversations this time around while I was gone. Despite not being in the best place in our relationship, my boyfriend adamantly insisted I go to London (London is my favourite city and it had been a dream of mine to live there). During my first semester as I spent more time in London, I started to really fall in love with living there and was very openly conflicted with my boyfriend about it because - despite having conversations about the possibility- when it came down to it, he was not willing to move there himself. My dilemma was that I would lose my right to live there in the future if I moved back (I needed to stay in the country for 5 years to get a PR) and so I oscillated on staying there or moving back many times. The conversations were very hard on my boyfriend but I didn't really realize this in the moment because I think if I'm being honest, I really wanted him to change his mind and move out there with me but he just wasn't able to handle the prospect of such a big change. The conversations culminated in my boyfriend initiating a break with me for a few days to think things through because he was really hurt by my indecision. This was extremely painful for me because up until then, I had always felt that he was the one reliable and trustworthy person in my life. It really made us both reflect on the relationship and made me realize where my priorities were/are.

He reached out to me to end the ""break"" after 4 days. We had a long conversation about what had happened - he was very afraid that I would be unsatisfied in life and was worried about me moving back home without actually wanting to and resenting him for it. At this point though, I had worked through a lot of things independently and realized I was using London as an exit plan because I was scared about the walls that had built up in our relationship. In the end, I decided it was more important for me to make our relationship work than to stay in London and so I had resolved to move back home once I finished the program.

When I was home over Christmas break, we did MDMA together to try to heal our relationship. We also had many emotional discussions/fights about whether or not we should end our relationship based on how difficult things had been. Each time, we decided what we had was worth fighting for. During this period, my boyfriend had a bit of a mental breakdown and started suffering from intense anxiety. As I mentioned, he's prone to depression but he started to attribute these panic attacks to our relationship even though they were obviously about so much more than that (COVID, a lack of fulfillment and sense of purpose or accomplishment with his startup despite putting his entire soul and identity into it, etc.) which has been very damaging. We talked about it many times and he would agree he was being unfair by attributing his anxiety to our relationship (even his mom had to tell him this) but I believe he would always default back to it as a scapegoat rather than confront the truth about his unhappiness. My time home ended up extending to 3 months because COVID was very bad in London at the time but I finally flew back to London in March 2021. The night before I flew back, we had a very emotional discussion that felt like a breakthrough to tearing down the walls. My boyfriend mentioned how he did not feel the magic anymore and he wanted it back so desperately and we vowed to take time to work on things independently and ""build back better"" once we were reunited.

Flash forward to now, I've been in London for 2 months and things have deteriorated over the past week. I was anxious and miserable basically from the moment I arrived - likely out of fear for what would happen to our relationship- but it manifested in different physical conditions that got so bad it drove me to the ER one night. I more or less have stopped sleeping. Within a few weeks of me arriving back in London, it felt like the walls between my boyfriend and I were back up which I believe triggered my intense anxiety. My boyfriend and I had kept up consistent conversation but it's been difficult to have meaningful conversations with the time difference. He was pretty supportive during these 2 months and although maybe not as loving as he had been in the past (which I still attributed to his fear that I was going to choose London over him and general depression), still very available and attentive. Something changed this past week though, kind of out of the blue.

My boyfriend is prone to apathy but this past week, I especially noticed he was pulling back. Finally a few days ago, I confronted him about it and asked if he wanted to break up. He admitted he didn't feel the magic anymore and wasn't excited about a future with me and that worried him and he wasn't sure if he wanted to break up. He said it 'didn't feel right anymore in his soul' and that he'd been 'fighting' it for a long time because he didn't want to believe it. He also said he still loved and cared about me very much but felt indifference towards me sometimes. I asked him if he felt he would regret breaking up with me and he said he thought there was a high probability that he would, but a higher probability that he wouldn't. Obviously all of this was shattering to me. We had made plans for the future together, we had agreed to stick it out through thick and thin because what we shared was so rare and neither of us had ever felt anything close to it before. I could not believe the words that were coming from his mouth. It didn't feel real. It didn't feel possible for him to be saying those things to me, especially over the phone only 2 months after we had agreed to take time to ourselves and try again when we were reunited. I did put him on the spot that night though by confronting him about whether he wanted to break up and he did say he was feeling those things in the moment but still wasn't sure how he really felt or if the feelings would endure. He said he regretted having the conversation over the phone and only did so because I asked and he said I deserved to be told the truth but that he didn't know whether those feelings would stick and needed more time to think and sort through everything.

Somehow throughout the conversation, I remained extremely calm but he alternated between crying and apologizing. I could tell he was genuinely very conflicted. It turns out, he had another panic attack/nightmare earlier this week and although there were no triggers from our relationship standpoint, somehow he still thought it had to do with our relationship because he had been ""thinking about it"" around that time. I spoke to his mom at length about it afterwards (they are very close and he tells her everything and she reached out to make sure I was okay afterwards) and she thought it was ridiculous that he would blame our relationship for his anxiety when his anxieties were far more complex than that. He's also had an especially rough few weeks with investors losing faith in him and pulling out $100K from the business, feeling extremely unexcited about startup and what he did on the day-to-day, having an employee he had high hopes for randomly quit and ghost him, and having the place where he lives enter a really restrictive COVID lockdown.

I still love my boyfriend very much although I agree the past year with COVID and long distance have been immensely stressful and difficult and we have lost the ""magic"", but to be totally fair, we hadn't really worked on things too much. We basically kept telling each other this struggle was temporary and we would be able to go back to normal once we were together again but now as the time for us to reunite is nearing (I was going to move back in July), it seems like he's giving up before we reach the finish line. I do think that once we are back to living together and the fear of abandonment is gone though, that we can gain the magic of our relationship back. We just allowed too many walls to build to protect ourselves from the uncertainty and insecurities that sprung up during long distance. 

I'm also concerned that my boyfriend is depressed and is blaming our relationship for his pain because he's feeling both overwhelmed and underwhelmed with life. I have spoken to his mom extensively about it and she says that she believes he does still really love me but he's very confused and doesn't know what he wants. She agrees that he's likely depressed and needs help and is unfairly blaming our relationship because it's easier than confronting the root causes of his unhappiness. What I'm wondering is whether to let him go or fight for our relationship? Is there any coming back from all the things he said to me? Has anyone else dealing with an entrepreneur boyfriend with depression had something similar happen? 

We have worked SO hard to stick it out and it just feels like he's in a bad place and thinks not having the responsibility of a relationship will make things better. Obviously the long distance doesn't help either as I think it has enabling him to disassociate from me. I don't think he would have came to the same conclusions if we were not long distance and we were having this conversation in person. How do I make him see this though? Right now, we're on a bit of a break while he sorts out his feelings and I'm not sure what to do from here. If he decides he wants to end things, do I fly out to see him and fight for what we have, or do I let him go? I genuinely don't believe we will find what we had with anyone else - we have said this to each other many times - and I'm not sure we gave ourselves a fighting chance by ending things right when they were about to get better (from a distance standpoint).

Adding to all this stress is that I'm now in the middle of job interviews for jobs back home. He's feeling this pressure because he's worried I'm only moving back for him (which is only partially true as I am actually very excited about some of the jobs I'm interviewing for) and keeps saying he's trying to ""force himself"" to make a decision or feel what he used to. He says he still loves me very much and I'm trying to figure out if he's just suffering through a bad bout of depression and feeling numb to everything. His life coach also told him that losing the magic in a relationship is a bad sign which didn't help the situation but from everything I've read online, it's totally normal to happen without putting effort into getting it back and especially if someone is depressed. Am I missing something?

Any advice from others who have experienced this would be so, so appreciated!   


Tl;dr - Depressed entrepreneur boyfriend of 4 years (the last 1.5 of which has been on and off long distance) has been struggling immensely with his mental health but rather than walking away from the startup that is killing him, he's shifted the blame to our relationship and believes he wants to end things"

Since then my parents have been telling me I have been acting different, and my sister said I was acting like I was constantly on edge and overall not being very nice. I personally have not been getting depressive episodes a whole lot, but I have noticed it feels like my emotions feel muted, or kinda dialed down. Like most of the time I just feel kinda dull I guess. Does anyone have any insight on this?"
sydtheslothkid,depression,1620444529.0,Anyone else ever feel an intense loneliness and exhaustion from loving day-to-day with people seeing you but not REALLY seeing you? The real you?,"Hi Reddit, this is my very first post. I’m putting myself out there and letting my words flow because I’m feeling at the end of my rope and I’m really just seeking some support and community. I’m so numb at this point, I don’t know when I’m find the words again. I really need to know I’m not alone right now. 



Looking at me, no one would ever know 

To others, I’m a rock.

I’m the one who will always check in. 
Who always knows what to say and is always there. 
I am the free spirited child. The ray of sunshine. 
I am the loving girlfriend. The friendly coworker.
I am always consistent. I am always there. 

Part of me wishes I wasn’t. It’s growing. 

I’m steady. I am crumbling inside. 

I smile and nod. I am screaming at someone to see. 
Just once. 

I sing Maggie Rogers while driving. I imagine wrapping the car around a tree. 

Would they ever see it coming? I am invisible. 

 Even writing this, I feel the need to sound right. The “right” kind of suicidal. Fucked? Yeah, I know. 

I think about dying so I don’t have to perform for everyone anymore and here I am. 

Still performing. 

Still hoping that if I can just get it right. If I can just be a better friend. A better child. A better girlfriend. Coworker. Better everything. A better me. 

They will love me. And they will see me for who I am. 

Maybe one day, someone will see. 

I used to think rocks were amazing because they never got tired. They just were. 

Then I became one. I’m exhausted."

DepressedAnon154,depression,1620644949.0,I don't know where to begin...,"I've been depressed many times throughout my life but the recent encounters with depression have been especially difficult. It's become extremely difficult because of my circumstances to even know how to word or explain this. Depression has been hitting pretty hard over the course of the past year and it just keeps getting worse. 

When depression first started hitting me last year in January, I managed to lose all of my friends who said they'd be there to help me. They all left me while promising they'd help me get the help I needed. I had nobody. At the same time, I managed to mess up so badly that I lost my friend of 14 years from my own ignorance and stupidity. Since then, I've become more afraid of opening up to anyone around me and as a result I have been consistently blocking more and more people on various platforms: my family, my friends, my doctor, and my therapist. I'm down to 2 friends due to this tendency to block people and I'm starting to think that I should cut them off as well just because I can't seem to trust anyone at this point. 

I don't have any hobbies at this point. I don't have any motivation to get a job and my money is starting to run thin. Depression has completely killed off my interests and I spend my days staring at a wall while hoping that I don't have a mental breakdown at night which at this point has become a common occurrence. If I do have a mental breakdown, it's numerous hours of me breaking down into tears while thinking of nothing but the many ways I could kill myself at that point. I know I am making everything worse for myself with these tendencies but I can't trust anyone and as a result I keep everything to myself. I just want to die at this point."
MarMarL2k19,depression,1620577887.0,I hate myself,"Today I woke up. I had breakfast. I had sweet dreams. I burshed ny teeth. Just my normal life. But then I remembered something me and my girlfriend talked about yesterday. That she will be apart of a dnd group every friday. I was a little hurt by it that she didn't at least talk about it with me. Anyway, as I was thinking about it, I realized something. I cling to people. I obsess over those who show me love and compassion. And I loathe myself for it. I loathe the fact that I rely on other people so much. I do activities like go on walks, runs, push-ups just to get my mind on myself. But then I find myself obsessing over the fact that things will never be like I want them to be. I hate the fact that people show me love but over time they cease to show that love.

I can't be happy for others if it doesn't benefit me. I'm selfish. For example, sometimes I play league with the boys, but when they go off because they ""don't feel like playing"" I feel empty. I feel empty once they leave the call. I feel so alone. And the same with my girlfriend.

The reason I am like this is because when ai was young, no one wanted to befriend me. Everyone I met bullied me. From kindergarden, to elementary... All the way up to 7th grade. I was pushed, insulted, told I was an inconcenience and an accident. Due to that, the people I met nowadays that show me love and compassion... I cling to them. I want to protect those people from harm and help them just like they help me.

And I loathe myself for it. I really have to seek out a therapist. I hate myself for everything I am..."
melnwater,depression,1620573045.0,I regret not seeking help before.,"I'm a 21(F) and I've always kept to myself so I don't know where to start or if I'm rambling too much. 

I grew up with pretty strict parents. Whenever I cried in front of them they got annoyed with me and told me that they were going through worse things, so I felt so ashamed and guilty when I cried. I still feel guilty being sad because I know there are people who have it way worse than me. In middle school my parents pushed me to get perfect grades and my friends were smart and mean and I felt so dumb. I wasn't allowed to hang out afterschool or stroll around town, and I felt like I didn't have a real friend that I could talk to. I felt lonely, and I was sad when my mom yelled at me for ""doing nothing"" and never making friends. I found it hard to make too many friends as I had to come home straight after school, but I hated myself for that anyways. My dad would always remind me how much money he was spending on me. He expects me to live based on his happiness because without him, I wouldn't be alive on this Earth right now. I never asked to be born lol. On top of that my dad would drink most times of the week and force me to be with him while he drank, which really drained me. His drunkenness would come with toxicity and sometimes he would say some mean things I wish I never heard. It was no surprise he would hit us more often when he was drunk because he would hit us even when sober. I couldn't say anything I wanted to say and I told him ""I love you"" whenever I was scared. I was so scared, and I hated myself for that.

When I went to the doctor during this time she asked me several questions and she seemed concerned and told me she thought I was showing signs of depression. I was scared because my mom was in the room with me and I was all teary-eyed because the doctor seemed like she really cared about what I thought, and I wasn't used to that. On the ride home my mom told me that it made no sense that I may be depressed and she was clearly upset at me. She told me she was doing so much for me and I had no right to be feeling like this. I told her that the doctor thought wrong and that I was perfectly fine, and immediately my mom stopped being mad. I hated it when she was upset with me. All I ever wanted was to make her proud. So I started living as if nothing was wrong, through years of constant anxiety attacks and isolating myself whenever I felt anything other than happiness. I had thoughts of ending my life but brushed them off as just random thoughts.

Now I'm an adult proud to have made it without any help, fighting my own demons thinking I have succeeded, only to realize it keeps coming back, and it hits back worse. Everyday as an adult I tell myself how worthless and ugly I am. I'm still living under my parents' roof and I feel like such a burden. I can't move out at the moment. Sometimes I think about how much better off they would be financially if I just disappeared from their life. I feel like everyone is just better off without my presence, and that feeling of uselessness always comes back to me. I just wish I went to therapy or something during middle or high school, but I always told myself that how I felt was normal and that there were people who have it far worse than me. I regret this and feel like it's too late for me, even though deep down I know that's not true. At this point it feels like I hate myself so much that I'm just punishing myself by not seeking any help. I feel so lonely and wish I could tell someone everything, but I am scared they'll see me as crazy or dramatic. I just want to stop feeling so lonely and useless and get up and fix myself, but I have no motivation for that anymore. I just want to make people I care about proud and happy, but I feel like I do the opposite of that so what's the point."

Sometimes they seem extra needy though and I really feel depleted emotionally and just want to curl up and be left alone, I feel so bad."
Yumepon,depression,1620615238.0,Narcissistic mother,"This is all things from the past(around 5-10 years ago), but I want to vent. Please give me a comment if you thought my mother was toxic or narcissistic, for I’m still not sure of it. 

I got into a veterinary school at 18, after a full year of doing nothing but studying, eating and sleeping. 
Mother resented this however, because she didn’t want her daughter to be better than her. Also she hated the fact her money(raised solely by father because she’s a housewife) was being taken away for my relatively high school costs. She became depressed and eventually threatened to kill herself if I kept going to school. At just 18 mother was everything to me, and I was in such a shock I couldn’t concentrate on my studies-every minute of every day the only thing I could think of was my mother lying dead at home-my grades fell and I dropped out of school. Apparently I too was depressed to the point I couldn’t think logically or reach out for help. Unfortunately father was a very cold hearted if not psychopathic and emotionally unavailable, he pretended as if mother’s depression did not exist and I was an ungrateful brat for quitting school. 

After quitting school I lost all purpose in life and a few years later attempted suicide. 
By then mother had found a new lover and filed a divorce to marry him. I moved in with her to his home and his children because i was still very dependent on her despite what she had done to me. 

I was hospitalized for attempted suicide and discharged three months later. I was returned home to my mother. The things she said to me there went something like : you’re a retard, you’re an embarrassment to the family, please don’t show yourself in front of my husband or his children, you’ll leave a bad impression for me. 

I was given a storage room to live in. The door had no lock, it was too small to even spread a mattress flat, and everyday and night I could hear mother and her husband having sex across the hallway in their bedroom. During those times I slept with a belt firmly grasped in my hand, and during daytime I would walk around the neighborhood counting the floors of apartments, finding peace whenever I came across accessible buildings that were tall enough for me to end my life whenever I wished. 

Sorry this is so long. I have a lot more to tell in between but I’ll keep it like this for now. Btw, for those who care to know, I’ve escaped both my parents five years ago, still dealing with heavy depression but I live away from those toxic people. Thank you for those who took their time to read this!"

Ta-veren-,depression,1620541503.0,Finally got a job but realized all I am worth in this world.,"I have always struggled with who I am, what I would be good at, what I should do for a job. To an extent that I avoided the question successfully for so long.  I finally lined up my first job and I was excited, I am way behind on the job front for my age and where I should be in life. That knowledge alone is pretty scary but I managed to land my first job, was kind of pumped and thrilled at the idea of earning money and being useful in some way.

Now, my dad meant it in a nice way, he really didn't understand the weight of his words or the way he said them but they depressed me to no end. ""Over the years I made a list of jobs I thought you'd be good at and ones you wouldn't be and the wouldn't be list had so much in it but this job I think you'll be really good at and I'm proud of you"" 

I don't know, the fact this is just your run of a mill, probably could have a robot doing it made me super depressed like that's all I am worth? Just a basic grunt? It's who I am and who I will probably be all my life and that's depressing.

No offense to other grunt workers but man it's got me. The only thing I have is the fact I did get to do great things and see wonders in my younger years but it's hard to look at my own future with any happiness. I'm hoping this will open doors to me and I will keep looking for others in hopes to find something I won't mind doing. I'm hoping I might finally get the answer to the question of what on earth I am supposed to do. 

Has anyone else struggled with what they want to do? How did you find your place? Sadly, my passions in life wouldn't create any careers for me."
zeron6789,depression,1620481013.0,The smallest things,"I know this sounds ridiculous and honestly i wasn't even expecting it today. But I was taking care of a wounded baby bird that fell out of his nest earlier this past week. (usually one per year) but they usually are able to fly off or fend for themselves after a day or two so i end up doing only minimal helping. (mainly just putting them in a box during the night time for safety) well. He died this morning. I had the suspicion that he was getting small amounts of food and i had the opportunity to go get meal worms at least yesterday but was too depressed and lazy to do so. (again i was trying to not involve myself too often so that i don't scare his parents and such which i have seen them nearby, along with his other siblings.) i decided that today as soon as the stores opened i would go and buy some and feed him, but that didn't happen. I know its just not normal, but immediately sunk back into that depression. That failure of not even being able to help another living creature due to my lack of drive to do anything. i just want to sleep and never wake up. and i can put on a façade of getting better but this idk. Maybe I'm just tired as i haven't been sleeping well, or perhaps I'm actually jealous and envious of the baby bird. Either way. just needed to vent this out.. I feel like if i could trade my life for a baby bird to have a chance at living i absolutely would. And it sucks that we humans get to live such long lives compared to other species. Why couldn't we trade, or just choose to end it all and a full proof way of doing it?"

pesymisticoctopus,depression,1620505859.0,"(TW: cussing, mentioning of self harm, alcoholism, violence, suicidal thoughts and slight homophobia) A post to let it all out because I have little to no people to talk to","So first of all I was never diagnosed with depression and never went to any specialist to even try to get diagnosed. I know I should but I'm scared of 1. getting sent to some sort of psych hospital and 2. my parent's reaction. I used to self harm but after my mother once saw my scars I stopped. At some point I told my mother about my feelings and suicidal tendencies. She reacted quite well and helped (well kind of) but she never took me to a psychologist and I'm pretty glad that she didn't because I'm almost certain it wouldn't help. Since then I got much better and for some time I was a completely happy and healthy teenager. But sometime ago it all went downhill again. My parents have some, well, ""issues"" to put it that way. A year ago or so I came out to them as pan and trans and I don't think they took it that well...? I mean, they didn't kick me out of the house or anything, but they were pretty weird about it ever since. I think my mother's understanding of lgbtq+ people changed for the better but not my father's. They use my preffered pronouns for most of the time and I'm really happy about it but my father still is REALLY weird about it. He thinks that I'm some kind of a punch bag for taking his anger out on when he's irritated because of the lgbtq+ folks in our country or when he's just angry at the garbage fire that are our politicians. He likes to just sit around and talk on and on about the stuff that bugs him and he gets pretty fucking angry when I dare to disagree. And about the ""issues"" - he is an alcoholic. Sometimes, when he drinks too much booze, he goes fucking insane and starts screaming at me and my mom relentlessly and he often gets violent. Today I got in a pretty heated argument with him. He accused me of holding a grudge against him because of what he did. He said that I'm living in the past and that I should already ""let go of my trauma"" and stop only seeing the bad that he did and not the good. When he finally left my room I just started crying silently because I was devastated. He is overall a pretty shitty person but to say ""just let go of your trauma""? The trauma caused BY HIM? On top of having a fucked up father I started noticing that I'm losing my friends that are one of my very few emotional outlets. When I talk to them I can forget about the sadness and disstress living in my head. And now I'm losing them. Online school doesn't help at all. At least once a day one of the teachers need to shout at us students for being lazy shits and tells us how the lockdown changed us. Yeah, no shit it changed us, go figure. And another thing about my friends - if losing half of them wasn't bad enough I see everyday how they live their best life, go out with people and overall have fun while I sit in my bedroom all day and if I do go out on a walk or smth I don't have enyone to bring but me. I'm happy for the people I know and that they are having fun in this trying times but it just hurts so fucking bad seeing other people do the things that I also want to do but can't. I'm also an introvert and a really awkward person irl so meeting new people and not making a fool out of myself is pretty damn hard. The one of few hobbys I have is gardening which is suprisingly really calming and is the one thing that still keeps me a little sane. After the whole thing with my father today I really started to think about just ending it all. It was pretty easy to figure out from his words that life without me would be just easier to him and my mother. Same with people I know. They seem so tired of me and my issues. I'm not suprised, they shouldn't have to be worried about me and my well-being on top of living their life. It's just so fucking hard having to struggle all by myself. I feel pathetic writing it all here and whining so much but i don't have anyone else to tell it to. I stay up all night because that's the only time I can finally ease up and don't have to worry about anything at all. I'm just messed up and I don't know for how long I can take it. If you read this whole long-ass post, thank you. Thank you for taking time out of your life to read it and let me feel heard."
Specific-Bug-8849,depression,1620512124.0,Just need to vent for a bit,"My mom moved to America about 4 years ago and I came here 2 years ago because I couldn't get my visa and passport until then. At first when I came here, everything was alright. But as I got to the middle of 6th grade, she started commenting on my body and saying that I was fat, ugly and how my chest looked too big for my age. I didn't really mind it at first because I thought she was joking but she kept saying it almost everyday. I became really self-concious but acted as if what she said didn't affect me. A few days ago when she started talking about how fat I looked when we were travelling in the car, and then she said oh sorry I shouldn't have said that. For the first time in 2 years she apologized to me.

I know she is working very hard as a single parent and has a lot of worries, but she yelled and screamed at me so many times, that I got to the point where I don't think excersing or anything I do would make me look better. So I didn't do anything and she yelled at me for not excersing to make me look thinner and prettier. She destroyed my self esteem and questions me why I couldn't be how I was when I first came here. I wear baggy clothes because I feel so uncomfortable and repulsed when I wear skin tight (sort of) clothes but my mom doesn't understand any of that and yells at me to wear the clothes she bought for me instead. I have to admit that I am pretty lazy and stubborn but she really didn't have to scold me 'to make me better' to the point where I wonder what's the point of me living anyway. Until now, I thought that what she did was ok since she works so hard to provide for us and has so many worries, but I can't take it anymore. I am truly grateful for what she did for me so far, and I wish I could help her, but I don't think I can just pretend that I'm alright every single day.

Will_It_Rain,depression,1620473488.0,"You make the words ""Thank you"" so difficult","When I first received news that you would soon come, I was hopeful. When you finally came and I greeted you, though ackward, though numb, I wanted to be happy, I wanted to smile and embrace you so that you felt welcomed. When we moved in together, though there were many things I had to do, though it was stressful and exhausting, I did everything thinking this was what I had to do. I knew a good life isn't easy, so as difficult as it was, I endured and pushed forward, because life would get better. That was what I had wished for. When you first came, I was grateful because I was saved from the hell hole I had to call home. Even though you'd slap me, you've never beaten me with sticks and metal rods, though my face would turn red and swell, the skin did not tear and bleed, nor were there any bruises and breaks. For all of that, I was grateful, because, you didn't hit me frequently. You'd hit me only when you were really angry. Before, I'd get beaten everyday, so this was nothing. I can understand. I was grateful that you were willing to do some of the chores and that the chores were no longer my responsibility alone. You didn't know how to cook, but that's alright because I can learn. I may have been 11, but I was tall enough and strong enough to get things done. I did everything to your liking. I filled out paperwork, made phone calls, scheduled appointments, read the mail, wrote the checks, applied for benefits, transferred schools, and many more. I practiced smiling in the mirror continuously for many years because you said I frowned too much and it was ugly. I studied hard and got all A's because you wanted to look good amongst the relatives and friends. You didn't like me leaving the house and playing with other kids so I didn't. When you were pregnant, I scheduled all of your check-ups and accompanied you to every single one. I translated for you, cared for you, did your paperwork, and I even named the baby that you gave birth to. After you gave birth, you were weak physically and emotionally, so I did everything for you. I cooked the meals, carried the baby when he cried, fed him, changed his diapers, bathed him, and taught him. He was my brother, so just like how I cared for my sister when I was 3, I took care and raised my baby brother when I was 12. I saw that you were lonely so I allowed you to treat me as your friend and confide in me, despite the fact that I also didn't have friends myself. I believe I've been a good sister and a good daughter. I tried my best and did everything so that you would give me your attention. But even though you didn't hit me much, you never held back on your words. You knew about my traumas and insecurities because I told you them, because I trusted you and thought you'd protect me. Never had I expected that you would one day use the meanest, cruelest, most hurtful words to condemn me, to coerce me, to break me. Your words that you carelessly spat out hammered upon my wounds like knives cutting into scars. You threatened to commit suicide if I ever defied you. I was 11 when you first said these words. You told me I was useless, ungrateful, and deserving of the abuse and neglect. You told me that I ruined your life, that had it not been for me, you would not have married my father, that had it not been for me, you would not have come to America, and that had it not been for me being ""needy"" and ""messed up"" in my mind, you wouldn't have to stay at home to take care of me. But honestly, who took care of who? You told me that I was cold blooded and that I didn't have a heart. You said I was selfish. You told me I was unlovable. You told me that I made it difficult for you to love me. Because I was just that unlovable. You threatened me that if I ever made you unable to love me, then no one else in this world would love me. You said all these things to me and even words much crueler than this. I was only 11 when things started with you and I had just left a place of physical, mental, and emotional abuse, as well as neglect. I was vulnerable and you knew that. You knew. You knew how I'd get beaten everyday regardless of blame or reason. You knew I was condemned, hated, ostracized, bullied, and neglected. Sometimes I would be starved and sometimes I would be forced to eat more than my fill of cold leftovers. When I was hungry, I have even eaten grass and weeds out of hunger. And when I was forced to eat more than my fill, I had to self-indulge myself to throw up halfway with the excuse to use the restroom before continuing and ultimately finishing the food, and yet it would still be too much, but its not like I can ask for the restroom twice in one sitting. All the while, they would hit me and scold me for eating too slowly. You knew that I was abused and that I didn't have proper clothes to wear and didn't even have a proper bed or blankets. You knew that even my dad left me to fend for myself. You knew everything, you knew how young and ""messed up"" I was. You said you loved me. You told me you would protect me. You told me I could trust you. You are my mother. Yet you emotionally abused me. You condemned me. You threatened me. You isolated me. You made me hate my father, hate my aunts and uncles, hate my cousins and relatives, and hate the church I attended. You made me hate everyone, distance from everyone, and then, I was alone, yet I still had a younger sister and brother to protect. But then, who would protect me? Do you remember how many days it took me begging you for you to take me to hospital for my broken hand? What about my knee? My spine? My concussion? Or and the time when I begged you to take me to the hospital because of an allergy attack? Remember how it took you nearly 10 hours before you and my father thought about taking me to the hospital. Remember how you guys still dragged your time and complained while reprimanding me while I was struggling to breathe? Remember how I basically had to check myself into the children's hospital ER? Or how I was in Crital Care for about 12 hours and then hospitalized for 4 days and has to use an oxygen tank to breathe up to the third? What about when I had nerve surgery on my right arm and you made me fill out my own paper work with my left hand because you didn't want to? Now that you know that my sister and I have depression, you say that I spread it to her. You said I brainwashed my sister to having fights with you and refusing you. You said that I am a baggage and burden for everyone around me and that I'm useless, dependant, and that I do nothing. In case you forgot, I pay for my car's maintenance. I pay for my college tuition myself. I bought my phone, ipad, and laptops. I even bought your phone and iPad. I'm only living with you because you wouldn't let me leave. Yet, I'm dependent? You say I don't do anything. Have you forgotten who manages the bills and doctor's appointments? Do you even know how you still have health insurance? Did you forget that when you called the police on my dad who slapped you, as reluctant as I was, I helped you translate and stood up as your witness to put my own father in jail? Did you forget how I had to go back and forth between the living room and kitchen to translate for the both of you so that you are both being represented properly before the law enforcers. Do you remember you telling me that you didn't want to put my dad in jail? That you just wanted to threaten him and scare him a little? Do you remember how, because of your ""punishment"" for my dad, because you realized he was the breadwinner of the house, because you didn't want to work, I had to rush downtown to the courthouse for the hearing after sending my brother onto his buss in just 15 minutes while trying to get a hold of you on the phone when you were supposed to be going to the court yourself by law. Do you remember how I almost died on my way because I didn't know the way, because I was in a hurry, and because I was dialing your phone and the prosector, all the while driving with my injured arms. I scraped my brand new car cuz I almost crashed into the bridge. Have you any idea how it feels to see your father in his jail uniform,, in that ugly and thin looking jumpsuit, when you're half the reason why he's there in the first place? My mom called the cops, but I said everything. Every word that condemned him was spoken through my own mouth. I placed him in jail. And yet the guilt i felt when I missed his first free call from inside the jail. The confusion and loss I could hear from the voice-mail. He didn't even know why they had him call someone, yet the first he thought of was my phone number and I didn't even answer. I charged 50 dollars into his name the moment I got the voice-mail because I felt guilty and afraid. He was skinny, scrawny infact, not to mention he was in jail because of domestic abuse, and he was chinese and didnt know english. I was afraid he'd get bullied because had he been bullied,, he was the foolish type to remain silent about it. When i finally got to the courthouse, I sat on the benches opposite the court, separated by a glass wall. After sitting through the whole 5 hour court hearing, I waited in the cold and dim county jail waiting room, on those hard metal benches from 12am to 11pm for my father's release. I didnt eat or drink anything for that whole day. There was no bathroom there. No power outlet for charging. No signal or wifi. After running across the street to make a phone call to my aunt where I had begged her to take my father in because he wasn't allowed to come home, I then had to run back and sit at metal benches by myself for the following hours, afraid to leave in case he gets released in between and doesn't know where I am. Unlike my mother who knows some English but pretends to not when its convenient, yet is able to flirt with guys online and call the cops just fine, my father doesn't speak English at all. I'm not saying my dad shouldn't have been punished for hitting my mother, but had your wife cheated on you and said she would continue, could you stand still? I protected my siblings in this whole incident. I had my sister and brother stay in the room so they wouldn't have to hear the things that was being said and wouldn't have to see our dad getting cuffed and taken away. I made sure both of my parents were represented. I only spoke the truth and didnt say anymore than that was asked of me when I could've said more like how you cheated. I was 19. I had just become of age. To this day, that whole experience was nothing but traumatizing. Then a year ago, my sister attempted suicide. So much happened, so much, yet how, how can you still tell me you love me. You abuse me and then act the victim.  How? How do you do this? What have I done wrong? What have I not done well enough? Was I not a good enough daughter? Was I not a good enough sister? Or was I simply not good enough because I'm me? Why do all of you treat me like this? Like I'm nothing? Am only a convience to you? Something you can use and toss away whenever. Was I born just to be used like a tool? Like how you got your immigrant status, how you got married, now how you're getting a divorce? I wish I could say thank you to you for giving birth to me and for coming to America, but I can't.  You didn't save me. She placed me in a place worse than Hell. I wish you never came here. I wish you had forgotten about me and remarried. I wish you had never married my dad. I wish you never gave birth to me. Before, though it was hell, I was numb and didn't have any hope, but when you came, you gave me hope and momentary care and attention, then you took it all away, tossed it about as you pleased, and stomped on it till it was nothing. I wish I didn't feel anything. I wish I never knew hope. I wish wasn't so smart. I wish I wasn't so useful. Had I truly been useless as you claim, perhaps you would've never given birth to me, then all of this I would not have to endure and experience. Had I never been born, I would be grateful to you. I wish I knew how to hate you."

Altruistic_Breakfast,depression,1620513066.0,A little bit angry that there are people who feel happy without meds and just by their own decision...,"Hi, I hope you are good. This is a rant. 

I'm jealous and angry rn bc some stupid bitch I know with loves to write stuff to show the world how happy and ecstatic she is in her life, wishing all the people happiness and peace and shit, and what bothers me the most is that deep down I am fully aware that's impossible and that the truth is you feel a sense of normal and peace in your life, but you cannot feel happy all the freaking time. 

I'm aware I'm being super jealous and judgemental,  thinking of the fact that I take antidepressants to feel okay every day, and I know I have way more reasons than this person to be happy, yet, I don't. I wouldn't trade my life with hers ever, I like the way I am, I just know that I clinically need the help of meds to be all right, but even without the meds, on the outside, I've always been the poster child of a good kid with good values and direction in life, which is all she's not. 

I KNOW I should be happy that they are happy, but it has cost me money, time and so much effort to be where I am right now for this stupid ass bitx to come and tell the world that she wishes everyone peace and happiness, like who gives her the right to do that?!

It's not that I don't wish others happiness and peace, of course, I do, but I don't feel entitled to say it like it's something that needs to be learned from ME, because I know it's a journey, and the NORMAL feeling to be in is a feeling of simply 'being', so I beg of everyone to understand that even if society is trying to tell us that we have to be HAPPY, it's not true, if anything you should feel peace within. 

I don't even know if I'm making any sense right now, I'm probably a horrible person, that's fine though. This is life, people go on trains and say random shit, others listen to Tony Robbins, and others listen to bitxes on facebook.

13547USERNAME,depression,1620514939.0,"We shouldn't tell people to ""stop caring what others think"". We need to teach people to stop judging others. Telling them stop caring what others think is like telling depressed people ""just cheer up"" or a blind person to ""just see"" or an anxious person ""stop being anxious"". That's NOT how it works.","Whenever a person says they are judged by others and don't wanna be judged by others, people will always say ""stop caring what others think who cares what they think"". This is terrible advice. A person doesn't just suddenly embrace being judged by others just because you told them to. In fact, it's exceptionally difficult to endure being judged let alone made fun of by others. Hypocritically, these same people don't give this kind of advice to gay people, transgender people, black people, promiscuous people, etc.

Before you say ""but LGBT people have been attacked or had their rights deprived of"" just keep in mind that if LGBT people didn't get attacked or killed and had all their rights but still got judged or teased by others, you'd STILL protest homophobia and transphobia. If you're gonna teach people to stop judging gay or trans people for example, then why when somebody gets made fun of for other kinds of characteristics they might have you instead just say ""stop caring what others think""?

Enduring stigma, judgment or even teasing by others is very difficult and damages a person's self-esteem and prevents people from being themselves. These people should be able to be themselves and feel high self-esteem without someone needing to ruin it all and judge them or ridicule them.

And many people who say they don't care what others think probably subconsciously do and don't realize it. But either way, just because YOU don't care what others think doesn't mean you have the audacity to expect others who get judged to feel the same way. We cannot just tolerate judgmental people and expect the stigmatized to endure the stigma. It's like telling a bullying victim ""just ignore"". It's like telling depressed people ""just cheer up"". It's like telling anxious people ""just stop being anxious"". It's like telling a homeless person ""just get a house"". That's not how humans work. We don't just stop caring what others think because you told us to.

We need to teach people to mind their own business and stop judging other people."

Wolf_er2020,depression,1620604765.0,The Reason I Don't Drink,"People are always weirded out by the fact I don't drink, do drugs, etc. The fact is I never tell anyone the main reason why I don't. I tell them it's for my health, but it's for more than just that. The other reason I don't is because I'm aware I might very likely become addicted due to my possible depression. Frankly, people who expect everyone to engage in stuff like that are just assholes to me. Insulting and belittling me for not wanting to drink nail polish smelling beverages (Seriously, the alcohol I smelled smelled like straight nail polish) shouldn't be a problem.

hazza987,depression,1620622107.0,Depression and OCD,"I've been depressed for over half my life now and I've always struggled in particular because I have OCD. This combination leads to the most horrendous intrusive thoughts. The worst isn't the vivid images of me mutilating myself, the worst are the ones that make me question my future and if there's any point in continuing. My dream is to become a film maker, specifically a director, and I've gone to university to study it. As I reach the end of my course I'm starting to realise that it's never going to happen and the thought of being stuck in a 9 to 5 job working for a corporation that barely knows I exist is soul crushing, I really don't think I could take it. I've worked jobs before rounding up shopping carts, being a kitchen porter, working as a bartender and I can't stand it. I just feel like the odds are stacked against me in every aspect. My depression and anxiety has really held me back socially to a point where I only just feeling like I'm starting to make friends at the end of the course and my final project, the first time I've been allowed to direct, fell through so I don't even have anything to show for my time at university. I'm leaving with nothing but debt, depression and a degree. I want to 'look on the bright side' but I don't see how anyone can in this world, a world where we claim to be fighting for equality but ignore the fact Muslims are being executed in concentration camps in China, a world where the environment is being destroyed by the greed of billion dollar companies that act like they give a fuck but then use children and slaves to build their empires, a world where even the people who swore to protect and serve the public are breaking into houses and executing people because of their own racist agenda.



I constantly have these thoughts swirling around in my brain which have made me start to question myself even more. I question myself on things I know are true. Things I've known are true for years I'm now unsure about because of how much I think about what I know and what knowing actually means. I've tried taking anti-depressants but they just make me feel empty and feel like they create a cloud in my brain that stops me from being able to think creatively.




I'm a broken shell of my former self and I'm at a point where I no longer feel like I'm living for myself, I'm only alive because other people want me to be. 

I'm sorry this turned into a rant I just don't know what to do anymore."

i went to a concert. i threw up, either becuase of bad sushi, or possibly because of nerves. I found myself in the venues bathroom. The bathroom was about 10 feet away from the stage through a wall. They played this song and hearing it through the wall helped bring me some comfort in a moment of need. Whenever I am laid low this song helps me....

With no fear of shadows spreading where you stand
And you'll breathe easier just knowing that the worst is all behind you

When I read a book and the characters were hurting, I would feel horrible.

Sometimes I would wake up buzzing with happiness from a really good dream. The dream was perfect, it was beautiful, it was pure joy. I would spend the morning clinging to the feeling, as my memory of the dream faded away. It was the best feeling in the world. Then when I couldn't feel it anymore, I would be hit with this overwhelming feeling of emptiness. By comparison to that dream, my life was completely worthless and empty and dull. I would feel so hollow. Like I had been given a new perspective. If THAT was happiness, then what could I even call my real life? It was nothing in comparison. It was like I was being shown just how worthless and boring and meaningless and dull and useless and sad my existence really was. It was shattering. I had dreams like this maybe three or four times throughout my childhood. I can't remember a single thing about them except how great they were. And how real life was completely empty in comparison.

Through middle school, and freshman year of high school, I was the definition of stress and anxiety. My mental health hurt my grades, which hurt my mental health, which led to my mental situation near the end of my first year of high school. My brain was so fried, from years of stress, that we were doing conversions in class and I was completely out of it. I asked the guy next to me a clarifying question about the units. He laughed as he told me I had just tried to measure weight in inches. It sounds silly, but it shows just how burnt out I was. The brain fog was crazy.

Sometime in middle school I realized I felt numb. I cried myself to sleep wishing I could feel. That might sound silly too, crying because you can't feel as sad as you used to.

When I think about that now, I can logically recognize that I don't feel emotions that well, but that fact doesn't make me sad anymore. That's how numb I am.

I used to feel sad because I was so numb. But now all I feel is numb. Life really IS just that sad and meaningless thing I came back to after a wonderful dream. But I don't feel sad about it anymore. Because I can't. Logically, I can recognize that if my old self was watching my current self, he would probably be brought near tears of pity. And I envy him for it, though I can't feel the envy.

..

Also - just a question for whoever might see this: have you ever had one of those dreams I mentioned? It can't just be me, right?"

He knows I have no other friends to meet. But I thought I will understand it and not stress him. Now I have heard he did a party with other people the whole weekend.

I've been struggling through the last few years with some bad times, bad life decisions, bad relationship for a few years... It was declining rapidly to the point of I couldn't stay calm unless I was drunk, dozed up or passed out. Today I'm trying to stay clear but I have also pulled myself away from any kind of expressing emotions and sharing my thoughts or anything for about the last 9 months. 

I know it's stupid but I always thought everyone is annoyed by me when I'm not ""funny me"". All my friends that I've expressed this feeling to before have assured me that's just in my head and they like me no matter what and I understand what they're saying but I just feel different. I feel that I'm tiring, boring, annoying and that's pretty much what drew me to stop talking to them about any of these. ( I also told them about that choice of mine with a mix of reactions...)

It wasn't an always easy time these last 9 month but I have to admit I had some periods in between when I just forgot about my thoughts and in general I was controlling it ok I guess.

Last month though I broke my leg, not an actual break more like I slightly cracked my ankle. So I stayed one month off work on my bed. But about halfway through I started feeling a bit weird again, like I was constantly bummed out but I chose to ignore it.

That feeling keeps on going since today but today it was my first panic attack after a long time. I was at a friend's house with two more guys and we were playing games together. While waiting for the next game to load I went to the toilet and I saw myself in the mirror while I was laughing about something and smiling. And like, I felt f***ed up. I was thinking like ""What are you smiling at? What's going on? Having fun? You're happy all of a sudden s***head?"" until I reached the point that I couldn't smile even if I tried. Started crying in the bathroom and lost control of my breathing. Until I snapped out of it washed my face and went back into the other room.

After writing all that, I realized that I don't know why I wrote that... I don't know if I ask for help or advice or anything to be honest. I just wanted to talk to someone about what happened. I don't know why. I just wanted to share it I guess and didn't want to be just the same old spam to my friends that I was beforehand.

Sorry for being too long I didn't want to waste anyone's time I just wrote what I thought."

WickedlyWilled,depression,1620617894.0,Does anyone else live in a state of constant existential dread?,"32 M here.  Just a figure among the broken.  Not sure what I seek to accomplish but another memoir to my anonymous audience.  

I’ve lived a solitary life, isolation is all I’ve ever known because I seem to lack the ability to relate to people or function in a social capacity.  For example I’ve never even made 1 friend.  Almost nobody knows anything at all about me.  There is no childhood adventure stories or college shenanigans.  It has always been me alone.  

The world is crushingly lonely and monotonous for me.  I hate my work routine but stick to it religiously out of the driving force of seeking security in life.  I spend weekends obsessing over how quickly time goes and accomplish little.

Long story short I’m a miserable human.  I am of no danger to anyone but myself I suppose.  I wake up and go to sleep wishing death or imagining suicide.  Just wish I could find more in life.  I hate the routine so bad but I’m too cowardly to leave it or kill myself.  My entire existence is trivial. 

I guess some part of me hopes that I’ll come across someone someday that presents some wisdom to me that enlightens a change in my outlook.  Otherwise don’t mind me I’ll just be here in my misery until I find my way to the hopefully sweet freedom release with death of conscious mind."

I've let go of hope and expectation, I feel like the only people I can dissapoint are others because I no longer feel the need to meet societies standards of success. I don't know if this makes me a nihilist, but it's like I realise that we are just animals. Every other species on the planet is content to survive...to eat, sleep, drink, fuck and socialise and that's it for them. But we humans have created a system which makes our lives so damn complicated and full of expectation.

I'm at university but have been failing all year due to depression and just feeling totally unmotivated and lost in my own head due to spending the best part of 2 years alone in my room. I'm no doubt going to fail this semester and lose my place, and yet...I'm okay with that. I realise that I'm not built to succeed, and to be honest the things I value and enjoy aren't the material things that we attribute to success. As long as I have my basic needs met, my health, the internet, movies, family and the odd luxury here and there then I think I can be perfectly content.

Maybe this is the release I need. I have been wallowing for so long in my sense of failure, that I'll never meet my own expectations, never have a good career, never have the perfect life. I feel like I could just get a not so bad job in a warehouse or store for 30 hours per week and be happy. 

Is this nihilism?"
Box-Just,depression,1620582886.0,I feel like there’s no point to anything in life.,"Hey guys, this is probably my first time positing about my mental health issue on a public forum. I’m not entirely sure what exact issues I face ( cuz they haven’t been diagnosed by a professional yet). But from my self diagnosis tests I may have a mild to mediocre depression + severe anxiety. I also have an OCD, body esteem issues & overthink.

I’ve been living in my thoughts for close to 5-6 years now. It started with a bad break up but it just spiralled down from there. The last 5-6 years have also been some of the best years of my life professionally.  I got selected, attended,  graduated from a Top tier business school, got a prestigious job, earn good money etc. I also dated a good guy after that but ended up breaking up with him cuz of distance.

These days I’m also dealing with issues about mediocrity, I feel like I’ve turned out average & will die unloved & unaccomplished . I’ve been abandoned by my friends many times , boyfriend so that’s another issue.

At this point, I’m so overwhelmed by thoughts that I definitely know that I need help. I just can’t get it at the moment ( I’m in a desi family so there are no boundaries for me to start taking virtual therapy). 

I don’t get self harm thoughts ( as yet?) but I do feel like everything is pointless. 

Like what’s the point of losing weight, it’s not like I’m a celeb, m just average nobody cares how I looks

What’s the point of money? What m I gonna buy with it? Car? Who cares? A beachside bungalow? Who cares? 

What’s the point of music? When I’m never gonna be famous for it? 

I know these are not normal thoughts & I do want to take action & get help. I’m just not sure where to start.

Would help if people can share their experiences & things that can help me atleast in the short term before I can start full time therapy & medications as recommended."

Outrageous_Rule_7597,depression,1620608620.0,What’s the point?,"Ever since I turned 20 a few weeks ago my stress and anxiety has only skyrocketed, and it really has only recently hit me how much I’ve wasted my life and my teen years. Truthfully, the pandemic was a bit of an excuse for me to avoid thinking about my future and my existence as a whole, but now that everything is starting to wind down and we’re returning to some sense of normalcy, I’m starting to feel shitty again. 

My brother got a job and he’s two years younger than me. It’s embarrassing, and I don’t have a lick of work experience except for volunteering maybe but it’s not the same. I got an eye exam the other day and one of the employees mentioned that she was the same age as me which was funny because she was already looking like a full-blown adult. Like I’m still relying on others for transportation for god’s sake because of my bad driving anxiety. Sure, I’ve applied to a few jobs and am waiting to hear back but what’s the point when I have very little skills and they probably won’t even consider me. They’ll have to be super desperate to want me. I do have an ideal job in mind that I want really badly but I’m terrified I’m going to be thrust into an environment I’m uncomfortable with and have to work with people that don’t care about me or my mental well-being. The dark stories I hear on social media don’t help my situation. 

It’s even worse because I don’t know what to do since I’m moving to a dorm in a few months for school and I wouldn’t be able to work for long before then. I’ve looked in to on-campus jobs but of course they’d be more competitive. Ugh. I’m just tired of feeling embarrassed for still depending on my mother for money.

I'm fearing that my time's up once again. I've just found myself sliding back into terrible levels of apathy and agony, finding it harder to enjoy the simple things in life and near impossible to attend classes or take basic care for myself. I don't have the strength to kill myself or the strength to heal and move on; so here I am, just waiting and rotting. I dream sometimes, that I have a way out of this mess and can make my way in life. Sometimes I'm able to dip my toes in the water, feel it's not as cold as I thought, but it doesn't take long for me to remove them again. Music and sleep are my two only escapes now, minus here.

It's been over a year since I've properly cut myself, but I had been cutting for about 2 years prior. It began on and off, but then I got addicted to the pain and cut every night for about a year and a half. One of my wounds got infected one night and I was scared that I had blood poisoning, and I freaked out and told my mum, who screamed and got my dad to look at my wrists too. They basically guilted me that night, saying how they ""thought they were raising a happy family"" and it just made me feel so much worse. My mum took me to A&E (essentially a walk in attached to a general hospital for anyone outside of the UK)? constantly saying how she didn't want me to get tested or diagnosed with anything because she doesn't want a child falling into that category(which essentially means that I can't get therapy or medication) after waiting about 2 hours, a nurse looked at my arms, asked me about 2 questions and said, ""well these cuts don't seem like you're suicidal"", and spent the next 20 minutes talking to my mum about covid. I havent talked to my parents about my mental health since because I know they'll just try and guilt me again, even talking to the school nurse didn't help because without a diagnosis they can't do anything.

She wouldn't answer the phone and the nurses were never available to put her on. Why didn't I call more? Why didn't I become more stubborn and wait until they were available??

I woke up crying on the 21st of January. I had a dream that she was gone. I got a call from a doctor less than an hour later and she was dying. They were reviving her, more than once. I managed to get ahold of my mother so she could be with her. But I was trapped. I wanted to be with my mom, but I was trapped.

I've been crying everyday since. Yesterday was the first time I had cried at work. All the Mothers' Day stuff. All the happiness. I was alone in the shop for a while and was sobbing between customers. I woke up today and was crying. I'm supposed to be at work in 30 minutes and I'm sobbing. I wasn't supposed to go in until evening today, but the schedule suddenly changed and I have literally no one to take my place. We only have a few employees and they all had morning shifts. 

I don't want to work today. I want to go to the church and talk to my Grammy. I want to cry and tell her I love her."

oublieternel,depression,1620512770.0,No reason to live but no reason to die.,"I’m tired of chasing down the temporary highs... but I don’t want to die but I’m also finding it difficult to figure out what I want to do. 
I’m just indifferent in life, I read a bunch of Schopenhauer and for a little while it surprisingly comforted me. 
At 26 I attained my dream job, something that I had strived for as long as I can remember. It was my reason to get up and go in the morning, it was the thing I always told myself one day I would do it. But when I finally got the job I always wanted. For a little while it was going well but now at 30, I just hit a wall. 
Like was this really it? Have I just spent the last 10+ years dreaming of doing this and now all I can think about is quitting. 
I’m searching for purpose where there is none. 
My will to life as Schopenhauer coined the phrase is relentless, there’s just this constant want, I want a new car, I want this and that, I want a new job, I want a boyfriend. 
Now just in a mountain of debt with no easy way out. I constantly spent money to distract myself from the crushing pain of existence."

AMR929,depression,1620451215.0,Anyone else feel this way?!,"TL;DR: 
Does anyone else feel the same as I do?! 
I am a pretty laid back person and responsible person, but I feel as if I had to grow up too quickly! 

I feel that I had to grow up way too quickly for my age and I didn’t have a “teenage” years.. and now I’m trying to live them out in my 20’s and it’s very frowned upon. I want to go out and party and drink and experiment with different things.. and experience life! 

My dad passed away when I had just turned 15, and after that we had to grow up super quick. We went from a two income nuclear family to being a one income single parent household and it was hard. 
My brother and I all of a sudden became these two lost kids who had to take on adult responsibilities and worries when we were too young for that. 

My brother took our Dad’s death harder than I did, and he was ALWAYS in a bad mood and when he was in a bad mood, he put our mom in a bad mood. I tried not to ever show my emotion or be in a bad mood because I felt that our mom couldn’t handle two kids in bad moods.. so I suppressed A LOT of emotions from it and I’m still paying for it. 
So therefore at the end of the day, rather than having our mom worry about what a kid was doing, my brother and I were always home and never went out and did anything. I know we had the freedom to, but it was always that little guilt trip that our mom threw on us, so we didn’t go. 

I guess I’m kinda jealous of my friends because in high school they were doing high school things and going out but yet I was at home. I feel as if I was robbed of a normal teenage years and currently I am trying to live them out being 24, and it’s not feasible.. like I have to be a responsible adult because I have bills to pay. 

Kinda sucks.. but I guess it is what it is.. 

Anyways just seeing if anyone else feels this way about their childhood?! And if so, how do you cope with it or just accept being an adult?"

baterie2la100,depression,1620507070.0,how can i help my dad?,"
i’ve been struggling with my mental health since i was 13, and i’m 17 now. I got diagnosed with PTSD, and i have dissociation. i’ve been on antidepressants for 5 months now, and lately i’ve been having a hard time,, existing. 

my dad came into my room a few days ago, asking if we can talk.. he said i might get some of this mental ilness from him, because he also feels far away from reality, and his mother was also a bit ‘cookoo’ (they lived in communism so getting professional help wasn’t an option). From what i understood, he is depressed. he also told me he’s had some suicidal thoughts and ideas, but that too many people rely on him, or something along those lines, basically that he would do it if so many people wouldn’t suffer if he did it. then he said he hopes i won’t hurt myself, because he wouldn’t be able to live with it. he also told me he might want to go see my psychiatrist, so maybe ‘she can give him something to make him feel better’. this whole conversation absolutely blew my mind because he’s such an introvert, he doesn’t talk much, especially when it comes to his emotions. We’ve had a pretty close relationship, and we get along really well, although the lack of communication can be felt. 

what the hell do i do now? he’s away with my mom for the weekend at the sea, so he said to not talk to my psychiatrist yet, because maybe he’ll feel better after the sea, but i doubt it, since he’s been like this for a long time. he doesn’t leave his desk (since he works from home, he has his own company). and he hasn’t been smiling much lately. i genuinely don’t know what to do.

i’m trying to be there for him, to support him, to see how his day went and offer comfort. but what if he’s thoughts don’t go away? what if i lose him? what then?

how can i help him? 

PS: my grandma told me (without his consent) that he’s attempted suicide once before, when he was in his 20s... we always took his silent personality as simple introversion, but i’m thinking it’s much much more. 

let me know what you guys think; i can really use sole advice and support, i’m scared of losing him!"

Shift1228,depression,1620444616.0,Life is just a series of distractions?,"There are a lot of things I can do.

I can work.

I can study

I can go out to eat

Any of these things might make you feel good for a minute. Then they end, and you return to your baseline feeling.

If that baseline feeling is self loathing, existential dread or boredom then what's the point?

Every possible activity is fleeting. I feel like life is a series of distractions, then I turn the monitor off or go sit on my bed and I realize I've felt the same way for a decade. I don't see any point in it anymore.

I could move or switch degrees or fix my addiction or try and meet people. At the end of the day I'd sit on my bed and feel the same. If its all just distracting yourself until you die, why do anything? Nothing lasts."
Minute-Limit-5249,depression,1620579057.0,Since no one commented the first time.... suicidal and feeling lost please help,"Hello Reddit. I’m not sure where to start with this but here goes nothing. When I was 6 years old I started to have thoughts of “I wasn’t meant to be born” and “the world would be better off with me not in it”. I’ve always struggled with depression (more specifically Major Depressive Disorder) and OCD and anxiety. Throughout my years, my mental illnesses have fluctuated between manageable or hardly noticeable to “holy shit my only thought today is about how I should kill myself”. I’m constantly terrified of the future, I have no direction in life, and no family now. I’m only 23. Last year my mother and her boyfriend were having issues and pushing at each other. In order to help stop the situation and stop from seeing my mother hit, I wrapped my arms around her so she would stop following and pushing at him. She decided I was the enemy in that moment and bit down on my arm, I had to go to the hospital the next day, and started to try hitting me. Luckily I’m much stronger than her so when I realized this, I simply got the upper hand, holding her hands down from trying to hit at my face while screaming for help. The next couple days after that when I would try to be there were bad; her boyfriend would threaten me with a knife and at that point I just left in my PJs and left. So now, i can’t even go to my mom. Everyday feels so helpless. Just going to work makes me want to get a hotel room and live out my days until I run out of money before killing myself. I genuinely can’t see how I’m supposed to work the next 30+ years while fighting in my head over killing myself, or thinking horrible, intrusive thoughts that give me back to back panic attacks. I feel like I’m just getting worse too. I wanted to try getting on medication but right now I live with my boyfriends family and he’s worried about how his parents will react to medication. I feel like no matter how hard I try at this point I’m probably gonna end up killing myself or in a mental hospital, and really isn’t what I want for me but I feel so hopeless and helpless"
PhrygianNoodles,depression,1620463951.0,Feeling insecure about my position in life,"I'm a 21 year old guy who has been suffering depression for about half of my life. Always had low energy, I've attempted suicide twice in the past, struggled with addiction, and now I'm just struggling to survive as a small pawn of the system. 

This has been eating me alive for so long and it manifests itself as rage. I'm tired of being looked down upon for working a minimum wage job and taking 4 years to finish community college. Believe me if I was smarter and could just figure things out quickly then I'd want to move ahead in life as quickly as possible. I just end up losing the battle everytime. I've had to retake college courses to pass them, I've struggled at every subject because my mind often just goes completely blank. I've tried applying to other jobs but I have no good experience or skills and I don't like bullshiting people because I value authenticity and that's the change I want to see in the world more than anything else. 

I get infuriated at the fact that I'm not desirable to women of any class because I'm just a minimum wage slave. I'm attractive enough that they want to have sex but they don't take me seriously because they see no potential in a guy with depression. I feel like I'm just pond scum at the bottom of the hierarchy. It makes me so bitter - being raised with these fairy tale ideas of love and romance and having these caricatures of what a relationship is shoved down your throat. Anymore, I can't figure out how we can have true love. Women just want rich and succesful men or a fuck toy or both. When they admire your sensitive side its because they can control you, when they admire your dominance is so you can screw them with more passion. They only seem to take. Societal expectations have only skyrocketed as the modern left has pushed for ""equality"". In reality theyve pushed us into slavery and degeneracy. We can't make love happen because people do not have pure intentions anymore. Nobody wants life to be a journey they can spend with their best friend. They just want to win. 

I want my life to be a journey, but to be able to accomplish truly helpful and amazing things.

I have dreams and goals that I put off because I can't figure out how to make anything of them. I suck at figuring out realistic steps and how to bring about change. My attention span is so small and I was diagnosed with add, tourettes, and was considered possibly aspergers from a young age. I have tons of physical injuries that prevent me from doing blue collar work, and I'm too forgetful to work a white collar job. 

I just work in a kitchen and while I'm decent, it's useless skill that no one cares about. I've turned down the management positions because I can't stand the company and I don't see myself as a manager. 

Its heartbreaking realizing that us sensitive and damaged people cant change the world. We are fuck-ups and nobody cares if you can spot corruption, read people well, or come up with new ideas. You will ONLY BE USED. I guess I'm just the rare sensitive type who wants to achieve greatness and feel like I'm in top of the world. I want to change everyone in some way because I can't stand the behavior they claim to be logical but really just boils down to them being slaves to our fucked up system. I try to call it out and everyone is just like ""what are we going to do? What are you going to do? You are nobody"". 

I dream about being put together enough to get through to people. About being somebody who can be looked up to and respected for their opinion. But somehow money and class are the only means to this. It doesn't matter that I've made the best of my brain's traits (even while having mental disabilities), it doesn't matter that I even try. You just have to be born destined for greatness or sell your soul (figuratively speaking). 

Sure I could try getting a trade job like everyone begs me to. And what? Spend the rest of my life slaving away for something i don't care about? At least in a kitchen i can talk about philosophy, make great food, and I have hours which aren't crippling me. 

It's just that I don't have enough money to do much besides survive. I am not deemed valuable enough by the system and it hurts so terribly. My ego wants to protect me from being seen as utter shit and so this is why I'm even making this post. Maybe somebody could reach out and offer some advice. You don't have to justify my complaints because I know I'm pathetic. I'm just a loser by definition. But maybe something will happen that gets overlooked when I mull over this pain in my head 24/7."
itiswhatiteeez,depression,1620613044.0,does this sound like depression?,"I don’t really know where to start. I’ve definitely felt this feeling before but it goes away, sometimes I’m almost on a high but then I crash one day. 

I recently turned 25 and I noticed as of late it’s almost hard to get out of bed. To put this in perspective I thought I had covid lol (I’ve already experienced it with major fatigue) because I woke up feeling so tired for the 3rd day in a row to the point where I’m showing up late to work because I can’t get up. It feels like everything hurts, my head, my legs too? and it’s a bit of struggle finding the motivation to do things. 

When I do go to work, I feel this weird stress and anxiety. Like I can’t stand still. Sometimes I go into the washroom at work and sit there and have these negative thoughts. I just can’t wait for it to be over. I got home now and I don’t know if they’re invasive thoughts but I keep internally saying things like “can I just die” or “I wish I could sleep for a week to move past this”

Another thing I’ve noticed is drinking behaviour. I get very down now when I drink and normally I’m in a good, cheery mood. 

Has anyone experienced the same thing?"
chewybacbacca,depression,1620630174.0,Tired of people saying that gen z is fake depressed and that we’ve made it trendy.,"All one has to do is look at the rising suicide rates over the years(I know it’s been on the rise for years in the US) and the fact that social media has caused our generation to be more lonely, detached, and anxious than ever before. 

I guess what made me write this is that I’ve read countless “unpopular opinions” about how Billie Eilish is overrated because she writes depressing music to be trendy and that she’s only “fake depressed”. Little do they know, she’s talked about how she used to self harm in bathrooms and has had suicidal thoughts. 

I do think it’s become fairly popular nowadays to “gate-keep” depression. Now you have to prove you’re actually depressed in order for people to initiate you into this depression club they’ve formed. If you smile a few times with your friends or take social pics for Instagram, those gatekeepers think it’s impossible for you to be depressed. You make one dark-humored joke about having depression, they’ll say you’re only doing it because it’s trendy; not because you’re actually depressed. 

Gate-keeping depression is weird. ANYONE can be depressed and even suicidal. Rich or poor. Conventionally attractive or not. In a committed relationship or not. That person you see who’s bubbly in person could be putting up a facade so you can’t see just how broken, damaged, and helpless they feel internally.

Gate-keeping depression does way more harm than good(if there’s any good at all) because what if that person who’s in serious need of help decides to attempt suicide—not to actually die but solely to be taken serious and to avoid people saying they’re seeking attention."

I don’t even know where to start. If you feel like this comment below so I know I’m not alone & we can get through this shit together. 
Okay so where do I even start lmao. I literally treat reddit like my therapist. 
First of all this Covid lockdown is literally killing me mentally. I’ve been just on airplane mode if you know what I mean .. I’m here but everything is autopilot mode. I don’t think of things I’m just day dreaming or not even I literally have nothing in my head lmao it’s just silent and I’m just doing my things. 
I moved to another province a year ago and I have friends but god do I ever feel alone. I always feel alone no mater what where or who I am with. My friends here have their own groups and that’s totally okay with that. But when I’m with them I always feel like I’m talking too much or not saying enough or I am extremely boring and they just want to go home. Because they don’t hangout with me the way their own group does WHICH AGAIN I understand because I’m their new friend and they have been friends for years. 
I feel this emptiness in my chest, I just wanna scream at the world for nothing. I am tired of sitting at home 24/7 and it is so extremely hard to get a job right now and I am so unmotivated to do anything. And trust me I’ve tried doing shit. I’m thinking maybe this is because I’ve had a lot going on last year from 2019-2020 because my best friend had cancer and passed away and I haven really touched into that. I know she’s gone but I have not come to terms with it. I don’t know how. I think I just stored it away and god knows when I can deal with it. I cry and I’m sad sometimes that she’s no longer here but I’m not sure if I have grieved Normally ??  I just had a crying stage stressed stage I couldn’t believe it and I still can’t. Pls don’t tell me it’s unhealthy I know it is but I don’t know how to deal with it. 
Basically I feel empty for no reason sometimes. Last week I had a heard week for some reason just a lot of emotions built up I went for a walk and just started bawling my eyes out and the weird thing is it was so cloudy outside and the sun literally was shining above me it felt like a warm hug from my friend.

At the time, I had just broken up w my ex, and things were not looking up in the city that I was in, so I moved home. Then COVID-19 hit, and I was forced to stay in my hometown at my parents house, while waiting for a global pandemic to run its course. My parents and I do not get along. We disagree fundamentally on almost every issue and this leads to a lot of what seems like normal conversations, turning into these full blown screaming matches. It seems like everyday that I’m stuck here is chipping away at my soul slowly and slowly. Everyday is the same, I wake up, hit my vape, procrastinate eating until I feel I am about to pass out, skate, practice music, go to work, sleep, repeat.  I feel as if I have been undergoing the same existential crisis that I experienced the first time I tripped acid back in 2018. The question of “Why the actual fuck am I here? I didn’t ask for this hellish existence”. It doesn’t seem fair to me, and it’s DEFINITELY not fair to tell me to “take it al to God.” “God gives us meaning” like I haven’t literally taken courses and read books on defending Christianity and why that gives us meaning, but it wasn’t enough. I found myself still asking why and because of this, my “friends” that I had in the church didn’t want to be around someone who didn’t believe the same as them, so they decidedly went their own ways. And the fact that all of my friends and bandmates live in other cities, my closest family member (my cousin) lives 2 hours away and everyday I seem to battle this detrimental feeling of loneliness that won’t go away. I wouldn’t say that I’m suicidal, but I just don’t want to live everyday of my existence anxious, tired, and so fucking sad."

thatsuicidalguy,depression,1620431197.0,Seeking help regarding my deteriorating mental health.,"Addressing the mental health professionals here, I'd like your advice and maybe a probable diagnosis for my mental health condition. 

NOTE: I haven't been officially diagnosed with any condition yet.

A little background: I'm a 19 year old male from India and in med school. I'm introverted, a loner and single. I'm interested in existential philosophy and started pondering the ""big questions"" quite early on in life. I was misdiagnosed as Manic Depressive Bipolar when I was 15 and was on Lithium for 2 years. My then psychiatrist diagnosed me on the basis of self harming, substance abuse and anger issues.
These factors might have a contribution to my rapidly deteriorating mental health presently, hence the brief mention.


Ever since the Covid 19 cases increased in our country, our college sent us back home and I lost connections with all my friends. I live with my sister who's a doctor and is quite busy  so I have the house to myself most of the time. 

It's been pretty gloomy for me for the past 2 months and I deal with recurring phases of intense melancholy and loneliness. Hours go by without me uttering a single word. 

I was quarantined for 14 days due to my sister being diagnosed of Covid-19 during which the signs of depression started reappearing. I could manage them back then but now they're even stronger rendering me incapable of leaving the house. 

I've lost interest in all my hobbies (I loved playing guitar, exercising and talking) and spend most of the time in bed. It's been 3 days since I've taken a bath. I'm used to feeling the urge to stay in bed and not do anything fun for quite a while but it's been intense especially for the past 3 days. 

I couldn't muster up the energy to talk with my mother on her birthday yesterday. I've lost track of time and have a difficulty feeling emotions. 
I haven't cried in a year. 

I'm extremely fatigued all the time, barely manage to eat one meal and smoke 3-4 cigarettes everyday. There's this intense feeling of doom and worthlessness that I feel almost all the time. 

I feel like there's an invisible wall between me and the world and that as hard as I try I cannot truly connect with the world. My emotions are numb and I often have to resort to extreme situations (Like watching videos of people dying, suicide documentaries, etc.) to feel a small amount of emotion. I'm completely detached from the self and everyone around me. My visions kinda hazy and I have trouble focusing on the present moment. 

I was suicidal in my teens and self harmed a lot but now I can control the urges. However, I'd say I'm passively suicidal because deep down I do want to die but don't actively pursue death. I would be glad if a bus runs me over someday.


My previous psychiatrist said that I might have something called Depersonalization Derealization Disorder due to my past history of trauma (Sexual assault, neglect and isolation) but we moved before I got a confirmation on the diagnosis. I haven't had a psych appointment in more than a year or so. 

I know as a professional you're not supposed to diagnose people online but it would be really helpful if anyone can point in the right direction and maybe advice what I should do next. Thank you for reading the entire thing and for sharing your opinions and advice."

tartist8,depression,1620558444.0,I was diagnosed a few days ago.,"Hey.  As the title suggests I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety day before yesterday.  I originally sought help from a therapist because I thought that I was showing several symptoms of autism or Asperger's Syndrome.  While those two options aren't necessarily off the table, it took about three weeks of therapy for my therapist to determine that I was instead mostly suffering from intense anxiety and severe depression.  I don't entirely know about what variety or exact severity he thinks I'm afflicted with (We're going into more details on Tuesday), but he linked me up with a psychiatrist who's going to get me on some medication in about three weeks.  I'm very nervous and reluctant, as I know a few people who have depression, but they had given up on treatment because nothing seems to work out for them.  However, I do have some hope because there are also a few people I know who've greatly benefited from taking medication and attending therapy (including my therapist himself).  I was also a bit surprised how much my therapist urged me to get rid of my handgun that I keep on the side of my bed.  I told him a few times that when I'm feeling extremely anxious or completely hopeless, I'll usually chamber a round and brandish the weapon with the safety off.  I complied and handed over my handgun to a trusted ex coworker yesterday, with very strict and specific instructions to not give it back to me unless I have explicit permission from either my mother or my best friend.  While I still have access to methods, the unreliability of the methods at hand greatly turn me off from seriously considering to attempt suicide.  Ah, sorry for rambling.  What I'm really here for is advice.  The thoughts that I'm having and the emotions that I'm feeling have been with me for as long as I can remember.  Is there anything extra I can do outside of therapy to boost my mood within a low moment?  Of course, I'm looking to ask these specific questions when Tuesday rolls around, but I'm open to different perspectives on the matter.  Thank you all."

imissfoodsm,depression,1620586033.0,Wish I had something going on,"I dropped out of school when I was 15 and it's been three years almost. I see my friends with depression--one had dropped out around the same time as me but completed her examination, another who graduated with a failing grade but is doing her best at online schooling and I feel like a complete failure. All I had been doing for the past three years was nothing. At some point in the beginning, I was writing and drawing and reading and picking up some study materials because I decided I should at least try to complete my exams but at this point I've given up on myself.

I gave up art, try to at least preserve my writing but still give up, I barely read and I haven't had an actual conversation with my friends in a week and haven't met them since the start of the year. I've given up on my studies too. I want to but I just feel like a failure and I'm afraid of everything. I can't tell honestly if there is something wrong with me or if I'm judt lazy. I feel guilty every day being here because my parent does not get angry at my existence and my sibling has given up on me. At some point I had tried helping myself up, sleeping early, waking early, working out, studying, reading, but all attempts have ended in failure.

I wish I was strong enough to hold my own and turn myself around. I try to tell myself that everything will be okay and distract myself in the present because I hate being reminded of my life and myself. I really dislike myself, at least the me right now. I want to change but change is so harr and I wish telling myself that I could do it works like it used it but I'm so upset and confused with myself and all I want is for me to disappear and lift the burden off everybody's shoulders because as much as I hate to face it I really am a failure"

Ken_Valerious,depression,1620493482.0,I feel like i'm trapped in a dark box of deperssion,"My story is too long and I don't know where to start but my whole life is falling apart, and i can't handle it anymore, can't think of anything that would make me happy again, i lost my passion in life. 

It all started a couple years ago when i left my country due to the civil war that destroyed every place i knew in my childhood, even my colege my home i lost it all. I witnesd alot of horrible things during the war, but i was able to escape at the end and now i live as a refugee in a new country away from every person i knew in my life, my family, my friends .. i left them all behind.
I tried to start here from zero, but i couldn't
I don't know anyone here, i failed to learn the new language to communicate with the people here. I tried to find a job but i couldn't and now i gaveup on the idia of me getting a job again, and i couldn't even get axcepted in any colege or school ,i feel like i'm no one, i'm just a pathetic person, 
After a year has passed since i moved to here, i recived a call that my father has cancer and they could not give him any medical help in my home country because of the situation after the war. A few months after that he died from the cancer, died while i was away i couldn't see him for years and i lost him.
My mom had cancer in the past but she cured and after both my parents had it now i have the fear of having cancer genes.
During all of those frustrsting things that i was facing, something gave me a little hope, like a little light in the end of the tunnel, when by chance i met a girl that i knew in the past and we had a crush on each others many years ago , she was a refugee here like me but she was here before me, she knew everything here, she speak the language perfectly, so she started to help me get on my feet again, we fall in love with each other i thought of her like if she is my only hope in life, i treated her like a god, loved her to the point that i offered my life to her,
But the disaster happened, she start to change with me, and all the sudden, she wanted a break up, telling me that she is not in love in me anymore and treated me like i'm the worst person in the world, i couldn't handle my self, she meant everything to me, i begged her to stay , i cried, i tried everything but no , she dumped me, at the end i felt so angry, i texted her with the most insulting words you could imagine, i sent here measseges that will make her hate me for the rest of her life and then i blocked her.
The next day i felt so guilty that i didn't respect her choice i kept thinking and thinking, i gave my self time and after a month a tried to contact her again asking for another chance from her just to let me back in her life as a friend, but she refused in a very bad way, she insulted me, humiliated me, made me feel like the most horrible person on the planet, i tried alot to get her back in my life, at the end she accepted to let me in her life as a friend but she started to treat me in the most humiliating way, telling me that i'm nothing to her, and that now she has a Fu×K-Body, and enjoing sleeping with him and i will be nothing like him, and when i heared that i got so angry, it hurts me so bad, i couldn't handle my self, started to insult her telling her i don't want to know her i want her just to disappear, and that was two days ago.
After the things I told her, I'm sure i lost her forever. And i started to remember everything happened to me, all my losts, how my life is a complete mess, i lost the last bit of hope, I really need to end my self, I can't enjoy anything , i wish just to die and end this suffer."
Exc011,depression,1620511166.0,Never thought it would be this hard to find a lover.,For the past 4 years of my life relationships have pretty much been the only topic of conversation.

theassinpotassium,depression,1620458565.0,How do I ask my therapist for more frequent appointments?,"I've been seeing my therapist monthly for several years. My husband and I also see an LMFT bi-weekly and have been for the past year-ish. Our LMFT suggested I ask for more frequent appointments with my therapist, which I agreed to do. Unfortunately, at my last appointment with my therapist (29 April), right as I was about to ask, he apologized saying he did not have even a half hour open in May, so offered 8 June. I agreed to that because he mentioned scheduling ""...for my more needy patients,"" implying I'm not one of those. I still felt discouraged, sad, and cried after that appointment because one of the last things he told me was ""you miss your partner,"" and it hit hard how much I miss my husband. (see note at bottom)

Now earlier in April, my therapist offered me a 30 minute call out of the blue saying ""I know you don't have any support so here I am,"" which moved me almost to tears because I know he has a lot of patients. I work for the same organization just in a different department, and have my own patients to keep track of so I understand the stress it can cause. Perhaps I am incorrect in assuming I would be seen more frequently if he thought I needed it. I know I need to communicate this, I'm just not sure how. I also feel fearful of becoming a needy patient.

Just FYI, my husband is in military training and will be away for at least a year. Our home is an 8-10 hour flight from any friends or family, which is also how far his training is from me. I have MDD, insomnia, and recently diagnosed ADD/ADHD. I'm used to being depressed/tired for no reason, but now it's worsened by my situation and I do feel I am struggling to cope.

but let's get into the problem. i am stressed a lot becouse of school, in my country a lot of students are having problems with it; stress, anxiety, depression and so on. 

but when i have free days (so no lessons) i sleep weel and exercise (not really tho since gyms are closed, but i play football for hours) but i can't find a solution. 

i still have a strange feeling in my mind, not that i feel so much but i think has an impact on my learning.

i want to read books but can't even concentrate or remember. i feel empty. 

i first thought it was brain fog, but i see that my head has less pains nowadays, but still i have memory and concentration problems. i just feel like i read words without understand anything and of course not even remembering them.

What if I don't die and end up disabled? 

My sister said that they are trying their everything to cure me. The fact that I'm still like this, disappoints them because I am still ""not cured"". And that there must be something wrong with me that I'm not trying my best. I ""am"" trying my best. It's just that depression can't be cured. I might look like I'm happy but deep down, I am not. I'm afraid they will think that I am just faking because I'm open to them about it. I couldn't help it. It was too much for me to bear so I called out to them. Now I'm regretting it.

They think I'm faking it because I have no reason to be sad.... Yes,.I have no reason to be sad but there's so denying that I keep on thinking of dying every single day.

She makes it sound so easy that ""when she is depressed, she just convince herself not to be depressed"". How does that work? I don't know. Maybe I'm not depressed because I am not helping myself just like they said? Please help me I need someone who understands me.

I’ve dealt with mental health issues for a good portion of my life but it’s becoming to much and it’s all my fault. I started to self-harm as a way to punish myself and it seems to be the only way that’s helping.

For years I’ve struggled with porn addiction, maybe since I was 14-15. And because I find the idea of sexualizing people weird, I decided I would masturbate to furry/cartoon character pornography. Looking back on it all, most of it is okay but there were some things that I saw, thought and read that contained characters that shouldn’t be sexualized(I’m talking underage cartoon characters). And I knew it was wrong, so I just envisioned them to be off-age or since they looked older in pictures I thought it was okay. Like I said it wasn’t all the time, and all of them were non human.

The worst offense I don’t even know if it happened. I struggle with various types of OCD, and sometimes I remember or at least I think I remember memories, basically false memories. Well I’m worried that I masturbated to an underage human cartoon character(someone from dragon ball). Because I saw a censored version of it on a YouTube comedy video. I’m leaning towards it not happening, but I can’t shake the feeling that something happened.

I can’t take all this anymore because just wanna die but I’m afraid of going to hell. I’m 20 and I still don’t have a job and I’m not in college and I live with an emotionally distant and fucked up family. I don’t deserve to be happy.

I have been diagnosed with depression before and I thought I had gotten over it, to a degree at least. I also lost my grandfather a few months back  due to covid and he believed in me more than I believe in myself. I came here because I feel I just need to vent everything and I am at a brink of screaming from the top of my lungs. I can't do anything by myself or at least the hard stuff. For example, there was this test for a class about circuits and stuff and I failed the first test and I just could not afford to fail the second one (which was the last partial exam) so out of desperation I used chegg with the rest of the class to answer the entirety of the test.  I just want to do what I like for the rest of my miserable life and simply disappear from the face of the Earth. I guess you could say that I am some sort of narcissist and I would not say you are wrong. I feel like I could do anything easily or learn quickly, but when I see others perform better than me it just shatters my ego. All in all I am just tired of working so hard for flimsy piece of paper that says I know a lot about the subject that is in it."
Kosti__G,depression,1620459173.0,I'm starting to be depressed and I need to stop this. So I need your advice,"Me 22, not productive, has no motivation, no money to go to a psychiatrist also I look at other people my age how good they're doing in terms of relationships, university, work, and so on, and this brings me down also I can't get out of my comfort zone, and maybe this is the one reason why I feel down and starting to feel I'm beginning to be depressed.  
And now I'm here thinking all the bad things that can happen to me, being down all the time, thinking that there's no point in even trying to make things better, but from time to time I try to change this just like now.  
I'm in love with the girlfriend of my best friend and this is the one thing that brings me down **(because it shows what a bad friend I am, but that's another topic, I just felt like telling you this)** so I tried to distance myself from this group of friends, to see if I'll curb my feelings towards her.  


So I guess I'm searching for your help.  
I know it's going to be easier to search on the web ""how not to be depressed"" or ""how to be motivated"" and all this kind of bs, but I think that I would nicer and more helpful if an actual human told me how to act at this point in time of my life.  


Hopefully, this gets your attention.  
And huge respect for the people that are helping others!  
Best regards, Kosti"
omarx17,depression,1620433540.0,18year old,"Don’t know if my age matters. but i just want to vent here, as i literally have no one to talk to. you know, it really does suck having no one to talk to, it doesn’t even have to be something sad or how i’m feeling, but i can’t talk about my accomplishments, how the weather is, opinions on things, all because simply i have no one. i turned 18 a few months ago, i guess i’m an adult. i remember being 15-16 and thinking i would be so happy when i’m 18, you know? in a better place or somewhere different, but here i am, in the same spot. still lonely as well. Being alone really is horrible. The thing is, i’m not such an introvert, i actually try to engage in conversation and bring up some cool topics, but unfortunately not many people are cool like that, or want to do anything with me. it sucks. i miss my old best friend, she was a girl, she listened to me whenever and i would do the same, it was a true and great friendship, i really loved her, obviously i never saw us as a couple or anything, i genuinely liked her as a friend. Then i got pissed over a little thing she posted and i cut her off slowly and slowly and i failed to realize that our friendship faded away all because of me. now i’m alone, i can’t find someone like her.  fuckkk i don’t know why i still have the same problems from years ago. i need to move on. we still follow each other on instagram if that means anything. after losing her i just realized how lonely and pathetic i am. anyways, i’m getting deep into this because lately this week my mental health has not been okay and i just been dealing so much with it. lately i’ve been waking up with a feeling to just die, to leave. i’m going to college soon, not a great college, i’ll be in the city, meaning i’ll probably still be in the same situation i am right now in 5 years or so. i have decent grades so i’m hoping maybe i can transfer and go to a big good college, after that maybe try to live differently. i need to work on myself though, i need to workout and take care of myself, i can see why i don’t have a girl or anything, which is not my biggest concern. if i can’t get a friend then what makes me think i can get a girl 😂. but yeah, life is just repetitive at this point, it make me even question what the point of it is. one thing i can promise is i’ll never hurt myself or anyone else. i’ll just cry in silence. there’s really nothing i can do but move on, i can’t imagine being happy. genuine happiness."

I look around and see how everyone is born to be loved, born to be happy. Well I'm born to die, but even that I can't succeed at. 

I used to think that pain was better than nothing, because it gives us purpose and reminds us why we live. I now only agree with the last part, because I now realize that I live to die. That just happens to be my purpose

I don't fucking know what's wrong with me, why I am so deformed, unloved, unwanted. The thing keeping me from hitting or cutting myself is that I don't want to become even uglier. 

And to end it all... I don't have the fucking guts for that anyway. Even looking at my wrists thinking of how easy it is to cut them makes me cry like a fucking baby. It feels like I don't have anything to actually live for, but still leave behind too much if I were to commit suicide. I have loving parents, a couple of good friends, I'm a good student and should be looking forward to a great career. Yet the only thing I can think of is my destiny for death and how much better it would've been if I hadn't been born at all. I know that's what I want and I'm pretty convinced the rest of the world would be better off as well. But for some fucking reason the universe decided to make me live anyway, giving me too much to die, but too little to stop wanting it.

I feel born to die, but forced to live"
SnooGuavas620,depression,1620438697.0,Faking it,"I got pulled into my manager's office and sat down with HR, and told to shape up. I wanna seek help, but I have gotten burned for this.

Working for a defense contractor, I have to hold a clearance, and so the therapist thing is a bit more complicated. Doctors can tag you with shit and ruin your career, apparently, so I'm scared of doctors being petty. If you're not sure what I mean by this, I should explain saying to a therapist that I was scared about what seeing a therapist would do for my clearance, she decided to tag me with ""paranoid personality disorder"" because I was scared what seeing a therapist would potentially do to my clearance, and I got a 14 page questionaire from the clearance folks asking for excessive amount of details for explaining myself after they talked to her. FML for reaching out for help when every thing about my life is under a microscope for a clearance. That whole situation was fucking awful.

I've been trying my hardest to hide it all since. I feel like I am performing a circus act, spinning plates, and hoping they don't fall. I reached out to the Employee Assistance Program, and tried that route, and I have to say, the therapist didn't seem to really help. She seemed kind of batty to me. I tried a therapist outside of work and she was hard to open up to and turned downright petty towards me so I stopped seeing her, particularly after the bullshit ""paranoid personality disorder"" tag I got for being concerned about talking to her with having a clearance. I can't seem to find a good therapist, so at work, I'm just trying to save face. This sucks. I wish the clearance didn't ask about mental health. Retaliation is real."

I am just...so...tired. I am tired of staying up until I'm delirious from exhaustion because the other option is laying there while my brain goes over, in minute detail, what a POS I am. I'm tired of going to sleep agonizing over what a terrible place the world is, and I'm tired of waking up to find it's somehow gotteb worse.

I'm tired of brushing my teeth in the hall and shaving in the shower because I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. I'm tired of wearing long sleeves in the summer to cover my self-inflicted scratch wounds, old and new. I'm tired of watching the same shows and playing the same games because the new terrifies me.

And I'm tired of feeling alone. My friends and family say,"" We're here for you, you can talk to us."" Bullshit. Whenever I try to take them up on that, or have a ""moment"", they hightail it. ""You're freaking me out."" ""You're pissing me off"" ""Ugh, can we talk about this later"" ""I'll come back when you've calmed down"" and the worst, from my mom, ""I will commit you if I have to, so pull yourself together."" After nearly being commited by the psychologist I saw once a year as part of my counseling, I became withdrawn. I can't express any negative emotion besides anger, which for some reason is more acceptable for men than crying. I wanted to cry over sonething sad, and I couldn't. I just got nauseous.

I don't expect anyone to read this, or care. I certainly don't care about myself much. I just...want to quit.

You know when you're a kid, learning little life lessons? One of those was that if there's sonething unpleasant you HAVE to do, it's better to just do it and get it over with.

Death is just about the worst thing that can happen to you, and everyone HAS to do it. Why not just get it over with, spare yourself all the pain and fear of life?"

I dont know why, i dont know, i dont know what to do now, i am almost at a point where i am just hoping for a lucky break, i am lost and dont know what to do, my gf and i are planning to get married in a year and she believes in me so much but i feel like a fraud and i dont know what to do.

inthzone,depression,1620442648.0,Why do people always say everything happens for a reason “except suicide”,"I noticed frequently when I watch videos that involve death that people always mention that death was that persons destiny. For instance I watch spiritual videos sometimes and they will say a spirit communicated that the timing was right. Directly after they say “except for cases of suicide”. Sorry but that makes no sense. If you have an urge to go driving and accidentally get in a car crash and die how is that different from the urge to go driving and crash because you purposely wanted to end your life? I personally don’t think it makes any sense that suicide death would be any different from anything else. I’m just a religious person trying to understand why things happen and I don’t see why suicide would be someone abandoning their destiny.

So, I have no hope for children, a partner or any domesticity, I have barely any people close to me, and those seem to be at the end of their tether dealing with me, I have no money, and no hope for any fulfillment in a career, because I'm lazy, unmotivated and drop everything I ever start. I'm a burden to those around me. I have no hope left, no direction, and to be honest, the only reason I'm still kicking now, no matter how small and stupid the reason seems, is because I would need to hire a skip for my junk, because I wouldn't burden my family with that, and I can't afford it.

it's empty. i feel so fucking empty. i don't know what it feels like to not feel empty, i don't know what it's like to feel like myself because i don't know who i am. i'm unidentifiable, i don't know if i'm real, i don't know anything. 

that emptiness and lack of self-knowledge prompts me to attempt to fill in the gaps in any way i can. 

fill the void by eating, and receiving absolutely no pleasure out of what i am ingesting. i often make myself sick in the process. i can't explain how disgusting it is to feel your body wanting to reject the sheer amount of calories you're forcing into it. 

fill the void by starvation, sometimes eating well below 500 calories a day so i can feel physically empty, head hurting, the world hazy from self-induced restriction. the world feels a little safer then. i feel like i am worth a fuck. 

fill the void with alcohol, despite knowing that there is a fine line between where i feel like i am floating and i feel downright suicidal. alcohol is one of my best friends and one of my worst enemies. 

fill the void with xanax to distance myself from the social anxiety that has its clutches deep in my throat.

fill the void with ain't shit losers on dating apps that i know aren't good for my health, emotionally-speaking and physically-speaking as well. forget about the loneliness and rummage through banal conversations to find anything but what's going on in the confines of my skull. 

fill the void with my emotionally abusive ex, whom i invited back in my life in a moment of drunken weakness. i'm waiting for the pattern to begin again.

I'd be typing a message to a friend on my phone and it wouldn't look right then I'd suddenly think how amazing it was that I could type messages on a screen and then transport them for someone else to see... as if I hadn't ever done it before. Things looked as if they were in some kind of ""Super HD"" and I just didn't recognise or remember them. In reality, nothing had changed. It was all the same stuff I'd used thousands of times before.

But then came the actual visual hallucinations. Bugs everywhere. On the walls, the ceiling, my skin, everywhere. But they aren't there. This has happened before but not for a very long time. I've been pretty stable for the past 10 years or so.

I know I need to de-stress but I've never worked out how. Usually I'd just drug myself to sleep. I don't really want to go to my doctor and be put on the personality erasing drugs they put me on last time to stop the hallucinations.

I can't get any time off work at the moment either which sucks. I feel like I need a week or month just to do nothing. I'm very overwhelmed."

I had a good week. Today I was especially good mentally. My friends told me I looked different in a good way.

I feel so uneasy though, because whenever it's like this I always know that depression will hit again in the future. Every time I get a high I will just slump back eventually. 

I get these intrusive thoughts that fuel this feeling of unease, and no matter how much I try to shake them off, I still wonder which one will take me down. My mind just never shuts up.

In fact I just realized that by typing this, I feel like I'm giving place for those thoughts to manifest. Why does my brain hate me? 
I'm so tired, but I'll keep fighting it."

CalamityCreation,depression,1620433059.0,I’m feeling bad about wanting to not feel bad,"I’ve been fighting some really horrible depression bouts for the past couple months and this week in particular has been really stressful and depressive for me and I’ve just felt horrible. I’ve been mad at the world and not wanting to exist or talk to anyone and it’s wearing on me. 

Today I got some good news and got to do some fun things so my mood was improving. But a close online friend of mine gave me an update that their life is currently horrible and they’re really stressed. Obviously I’m being there for them but it’s been so long since I’ve felt happy I’ve been fighting myself not to sacrifice this rare good mood because they’re having a horrible time, and it’s not working. I feel bad, they deserve a much better life, and it’s so hard for me to feel joy when people around me are miserable. I’m hoping things go better for them soon because it’s really pulling me down as well because I have to be there for them, and now I feel guilty as hell for even having a good day and telling them, like I’m rubbing it in their face. 

I wish they had a better life and I wish I didn’t feel horrible about wanting to be happy instead of depressed all the fucking time. I’m trying so hard not to be so scared and sad, and it’s not working anymore."
georgegetsmoney,depression,1620444064.0,Need guidance.,"Hello. I have treatment resistant depression & a strange form of ocd. I’ve had mental issues my whole life but ever since getting diagnosed with ADHD my life went downhill. Fast. I quit taking stimulant medication because I developed anti-social behavior & started smoking copious amounts of weed & isolated myself. Truth be told, ever since quitting these a year ago things have gotten very very bad. I dropped out of college my last year, had dpdr (maybe I still do & just live with it who knows), have VERY severe cognitive dysfunction, lost all of my friends, lost interest in anything, the list goes on & on. Now all that I do is obsess over what is wrong with me, be jealous 24/7 of people that are “normal”, google possible treatments & medications, go to work part-time as a bus boy (a miracle I am still employed as I literally do not/cannot talk to anyone), vape, and sleep. Not. A. Single. Thing. Else. Even if I wanted to do something else, I am trapped in my head no matter what I do. I am hopeless that this will be forever & that I will not achieve any of the things I wish to do/become.

This fucking sucks :))))

So here I am, looking for advice. 

Things I have tried
-Zoloft
-Abilify
-Vyvanse
-Concerta
-Fetzima (current)
-Latuda (current)
-Armodafinil (current)
-Ketamine IV (current but feel like giving it up since I am not the one paying for it nor has it provided any relief.

Things I am looking at:
-Nardil
-Parnate
-Anafranil/Clomipramine 


Living a life delusional w so much pain is very hard. So please please provide any anecdotal experiences/advice you have for me regarding these medications & if you were in a similar state of mind @ one point & were able to crawl out of it.

Thank you much love."

I'm 13 years old and I'm feeling depressed
it started when I was 9. the reason? idk
a few months ago my mom took my phone because she saw my self harm injuries
and what she did? she got my phone, and in that time I had some ""web-friends"" she thought they were pedos even if I talked to them a lot
btw she just assumed that I was gay and instead of being worried about my self harm injuries she was more worried if I was gay or not
my brother worried about me for 1 week and started to be an 4ssh0le again(he's 23)
I only have contact with 2 of my ""web-friends"" and one of them is kinda my best friend

But even when I wasn't living here, a lot of the care fell to me, my mom and my aunt. Then my husband and I moved in to be 24/7 support.
Well, my grandfather passed away a few weeks ago and now that the viewing and funeral mass is over, I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know who I am because he was an every day consideration for me.

KrusktheVaquero,depression,1620549086.0,Why do I feel so empty?,"(Forgive formatting, on mobile)

Background: I have a kind of complex history with mental health. I've had a life long fight with depression, there were years where I just never felt any hope or affection from anyone. I thought I would just get killed when I got out of highschool, and that would be my end. I never even checked my SAT score, I figured I wouldn't need it. I also struggled with a lack of focus or direction in life. 

I recently entered a trade school for my dream job. I was so excited at first, I felt hope for the first time in a very long time. I felt so good that I started repairing my relationships in my family and started trying to unravel my issues. Now, about a year later, I feel really empty. Not in a ""oh my life is worthless"" kind of way like before, now its more like a total lack of passion. All that energy and drive I had at the start of trade school is gone. Don't get me wrong, I still love my career, but I just feel empty. 

I feel like I traded out my existential dread for apathy. Can I get any advice on how to get that passion back?"

It's been about a month since my depression has gone from manageable to ""struggle to get out of bed"" again. I am on Lexapro, Abilify and Prozosin (for PTSD nightmares).

\- No hobbies are bringing me joy and everything is exhausting me. What can I do to get some energy back?

\- My doctor has suggested changing my antidepressant. Do I go down this route or stick it out with Lexapro?

\- I am in counselling for PTSD twice a week and it's taking up a lot of time and mental energy. Do I suggest to my psychologist to slow down a bit or stick it out for another few weeks until the program finishes?

Great-Consequence-98,depression,1620514782.0,Feel like my life is a waste. How do I get back on my feet? 34M,"I had such big dreams as a high school student. I wanted to change the world though sustainable energy.
Now all I want to to afford a house without mortgaging my life away and having some time to do the things I love. My decisions have gone to shit:

I loved the lifestyle of the town I lived in. It was great, good lifestyle, good uni, not a heap of jobs but ok. Houses were reasonable affordable.

I never bought a place because I wanted to make that decision with the person I married. Instead I saved a lot to be ready.  I accepted I lost a little bit keeping it in cash, but I wanted a house purchase to be a joint decision (And the transaction costs of buying and selling are quite high so you want it to be a long term decision). 

I felt I'd held off long enough and really wanted to buy. During coronavirus I worked hard and got a better more secure job. All the ""expert"" options was there would be a fall in house prices (in Australia). With such good savings & a safe job I was in a prime position, or so I thought. 

My plan was too buy and gradually start my own sustainability based company at a local business startup centre while still working.  

Unfortunately house prices have absolutely exploded. My more than my 11 years of hard savings feels a waste. In the area I wanted to buy they have increased by more than that. It feels like such a waste. I have no motivation anymore. So now for the money I could have got a nice house in a nice location gets me a shabby house in a bad location.

It's really affecting my mental health, I can't sleep at night & function during the day. 

I feel like my future went from being all set up to live in a great place and make a difference in the world without a big mortgage, to being shit and not worth it. 

Friends who didn't with as hard, earnt less, hardly saved at all but bought a property are doing so much better. 

Added to this is pressure of deciding a future with my girlfriend, and I know she sees the effect on me.

Basically:
I hate my new job
I hate the hours and commute  of my new job, no time for fun anymore
I'm unsure in my relationship
To buy a property I now need to mortage myself to the hilt, when one 1 year ago it was very affordable. Also the growth feels crazy and unsustainable so I worry about buying at the peak, but also I need my own place, I can't wait longer. I also feel I want to lock in my relationship before I do this. 

The pressure I feel is unbearable, all the while houses are still going up. Even right out of town in the country is hundreds of thousands of dollars more extensive now. And getting higher week by week.

I feel like just quitting, why work hard as an engineer. Doing productive work for the economy is not rewarded anywhere near as much as owning houses (unproductive assets). Australia is fucked!"

We are all aware of the reality we inhabit.
It is said ignorance is no defence in law, so how can we justify the sidelining of our collective and individual conscience? Why do we accept an inherently cruel society? It beckons an avalanche of shame that will not shake. 

We are sleepwalking in a state of cognitive dissonance. No measure of mental gymnastics can justify how selfish the world has become. How we idolise capital and pursue profit regardless of the consequences. 

What are we without integrity? Without kindness? Without honesty? What are we in their absence? 

History will remember us as cowards. It will remember our silent subservience and collobaration with our masters. 

We desperately require the collective discussion on what is good, what is beautiful, what is noble, what is pure and true; what is worth living for. 

Because that is the only conversation worth having."

Specialist_Note_7997,depression,1620579104.0,Life of depression,"I have been betrayed many times in my life.
It’s always the ones you let close to you and that’s what makes it hurt the most. When I was younger I used to see my dad abuse my mom. I used to tremble in my covers when they would fight. That’s when depression was introduced. Before I was 10 I began thinking about killing myself.

I found my mom when she overdosed on pills because she suspected my dad was cheating on her.She survived because I found her. Later My dad admitted to me that he was cheating. So her assumption was right.Ever since I have hated this life and world that I was given. There are so much more deserving people to be alive than me.

First betrayal was this girl in my neighborhood that I liked then eventually loved more than anything. After some years bf/gf she moved across town. That’s where it went bad. She was at a different school and met new friends. She started talking to a friend and eventually cheated on me with him. She ripped my heart out and stomped on it. So me being dumb convinced her to stay with me and try to have a baby. We were in our teens still in high school. So it was not a smart choice. Luckily she didn’t get pregnant. I ended up walking away with no feeling for her. She eventually regretted what she had done and begged me to take her back. I didn’t. I went out with three more girls after. But not getting to close to them. I was young and good looking. I had confidence.
I started my first job when I was sixteen and a year later seen this beautiful girl at the time clock. I will never forget that moment. Her smile would instantly bring happiness to anyone she smiled at.
But she had a boyfriend but I still wished she was mine. I didn’t have confidence then and became introverted. I would never have courage to talk to her. She eventually broke up with her boyfriend and was dating a lot.
My friend told her I wanted to talk to her. So she approached me and we starting talking.
This made me happy. But I still had scars from the first betrayal so I kept my distance.
We started being bf/gf. She was the best thing to happen to me. This gorgeous girl was interested in me. It was unbelievable.
So after a few months I get a call from one of her friends and he says that she’s riding around with him to trying to hook up with his friend. This friend is the guy that my previous girlfriend cheated on me with.
So I learned my lesson and called her at work. Told her I wanted to break up because I wasn’t going to be hurt like that again. She rushed to my house and convinced me not to break up with her.
That should of been it if I stuck to my original thought of just breaking up with her.
There was other instances that made me doubt her being faithful to me but I just brushed it  because  she was so beautiful and wanted to be with Me.
So we were together 3 years then got married in 2000. Those three years were filled with suspicion of her cheating. So the next three years I still had suspicions. I got so distraught with the thought of it that I bought some sleeping pills to make me sleep and not waking up. I didn’t want to feel that pain again. But we got through it.
After three years of marriage she wanted a baby but I was reluctant because I didn’t know if this was going to last. I was real depressed then and didn’t want to be here anymore. Well she got pregnant and we had my son which gave me new reason to live. I couldn’t leave him fatherless.He is the first good thing in my life. My first born. My first unconditional love. My son. So three more years go by and I having suspicions of her again. So like the first betrayal I decided let’s have another baby. Thinking it would make things better. So we had my daughter which was another great thing to happen in my life. She is my princess. Always will be.
So our relationship improved. The next 12 years were filled with ups and down. Suspicions were always there from beginning. So in 2018 she moves to a different work location and we are no longer working in same building. Has new friends who are not so loyal to their husbands. But to me she isn’t like them so why have friends like that. So she goes on a trip with them and things with never be the same.
Before the trip she was constantly on snap.
A lot of guys were on her snap. So she came back from her trip and I just feel like something is not right. So four days after trip I noticed she was snapping some guy.
She tried to tell me it was nothing. I got mad and told her to delete the app. She wouldn’t do it. Day later she comes and show me that she deleted him. But I knew better. So days later we are drinking having a good time. I bought her roses. The whole time she snapping right next to me.
So after having a good time she goes to take a shower. I pick up her phone and it auto fills her password on snap. I seen she had someone name as “My Baby”. It instantly made me crumble. I couldn’t believe it. I asked her about it and she had a o shit face. She said it was nobody. I flipped and told her I was leaving her. She was pleading for me not to leave her. I took off and was driving after taking out a bottle of tequila. I wanted to kill myself.This was the ultimate betrayal. So I went back home.
She was trying to sweet talk me and tell me it was nothing. But how can you call someone my baby and it’s nothing.
So next day I just can’t handle it and take bottle of sleeping pills. So I get put in a mental hospital for a week. She visits and says she hasn’t been on snap. I was at peace in there. No thoughts. No worries.
So I get out and find out she has been on snap. This is third lie. So she makes me go to a therapist to work on me. Because it’s my fault she was talking to another guy.
So I clamped down. No more hanging out with those immoral friends. No more snap.
She does it. The last four years I am on edge. Worrying about her doing this again.
I am not at peace. So I see different things that don’t look right. I ask her and she has explanation but no proof of what she was doing. So presently I noticed she gets a lot of texts and calls from a guy at work. I ask her and she says he just a friend that’s needing help. But all these calls are when I am not with her. So I suspect it’s something else. I text guy and ask him and he says it’s nothing. It stopped so I thought. Then found wife has a another phone that she’s been using to talk to him. I catch her in more lies. 
She won’t admit it. I have proof and she still won’t admit it. After almost  24 year together this is how it ends. With lies and deceit. I am hurt.betrayed. Devastated.crushed. That she did this to me. I again am wanting not to be here anymore. I really was going to kill myself yesterday to rid of this pain.  My son found me in tears. I told him I wanted to die. He said I couldn’t because he would do the same. I promised I wouldn’t hurt myself.
The thought has always been there. This life I was given has been hell. The girl I met 23 years is someone else. I just don’t understand it. Her straight face lies.
This is my depression and my sorrow.
If you read all this I thank you. This is my story,my pain and My heart bleeding out with all these words. 
My Love for her has now turned to HATE!!!"

I think he may be cheating but that’s based off a gut feeling and how he’s sneakier, less affectionate, less caring. Lately it’s been work home eat games sleep. I don’t get a place in his life I can literally sit and watch him play games for two hours without any attention coming from him.

I’m finding myself crying constantly, over things that might seem small but are really just causing the bigger things to come through. I never thought I was suicidal, but I don’t think it’s normal to think about how it would be better if you didn’t exist. That maybe all the things you’re feeling would go away if that happened. I don’t know if I would ever do it, I’d be too ashamed of the pain I’d leave my mother in. But how does one overcome this kind of sadness? I have absolutely no feeling toward anyone really, like I try to, but the people I truly care about have hurt me so much and don’t reciprocate the same care, so I’ve just shut myself off emotionally toward them. Because of that I’m so lonely, I don’t have anyone to turn to. I’m utterly miserable and sad and I only have my dog. I feel like a loser most of the time, my life is not at all what it was supposed to be, what I tried to make it be. I feel like it’s partially my fault, but I also know most of it was out of my hands and life happened to me in the worst way. I’m so depressed about so many things and I don’t even know where to began to stop feeling like this. How do I get happy, how do I get not depressed? I didn’t used to be this way, I had hope, joy for the future and just life in general. Now that I’ve completely lost it I don’t know how to get it back.

pkchu94,depression,1620539307.0,Emotionally Drained and Overwhelmed,"Tried to make an excuse to reschedule my belated birthday gathering because I was emotionally unwell didn't go so well. I was still kind of forced to come out and was screaming inside the entire time because I no longer felt I was capable of being present to enjoy my time with friends. Feeling like I was getting fingers pointed at me for possibly overreacting at trying to work around everyone's schedule and making me feel like I'm being inconsiderate of people's time and circumstances made me feel worse when I had intended the exact opposite.

Having a guy friend aggressively say that my time should only revolve around the time that I make with him and no one else's-- felt hostile and alarming to me when I told him that I can't guarantee but I will try to make time. The excuse that it was a joke felt off putting and felt like he was gas lighting me when he tried to turn things around after pointing it out. The text message exchange reminded me of recurring memories of my ex boyfriend and it certainly didn't make me feel good. It made things weird when he sent me a reel with a quote revolving around, ""what are we,"" after what had happened and when we are only friends.

A situation where I witnessed a creep trying to use suicide as an excuse to try to get close to a girl triggered my emotions as hearing him say that she was being dramatic. It made me feel invalidated of my emotions and thoughts although it had nothing to do with me. Breaking down in a restroom stall and questioning my current emotions made me feel even more overwhelmed.

The thought of gathering more people for a mountain hike scares me as I don't want to put myself in another stressful situation like my belated birthday gathering. The general thought of a social gathering is now also scaring me and I'm starting to lose interest in the plans that I was looking forward to in the next couple of months.

I want to shut out from the world right now and detox from any social interaction for a while and I don't want to lash out on anyone due to my emotions. But I also don't want people to bug me and ask me if I'm okay and to talk about it because I know that they won't understand how I'm feeling."

I know memory loss can be an effect of Depression, but mine seems abnormally bad. I literally cannot remember anything from my childhood. I can remember a few of my old friends names and the school I went to, but I can't picture them, or anything we did.

I know that certain things happened (what we used to play, my old address, a couple instances of me being bullied etc) but I cannot picture them, or remember them aside from a few general points (the way we used to play fairies, my old Street name etc).

Even now, I can't remember what I did last year properly, or specific dates of events I know happened in recent years.

zoedanielleb,depression,1620624132.0,I have a nagging feeling of discontentment with where I am in life and it scares me.,"(F19) I’ve had depressive episodes since I was 13, but for many years they only happened around Christmas break and I knew it would get back to normal once I went back to school. Then in 2019 I was hit with a bad spell of insomnia that threw me into a nervous breakdown and I haven’t been truly normal since. The next school year, I’d feel completely content and normal at school, then everyday when I got home I’d be overwhelmed with sadness. That went away eventually and I went back to normal, then COVID hit and my sleep got super messed up again which threw me into another nervous breakdown. I got depressed again but eventually it got back to normal and I was happy for a while. Then fall and winter hit and my seasonal depression started up again. I just felt like there was a weight bringing me down, a quiet discontentment with where I was in my life. I don’t know what it is, but the feeling just kills my joy and calm. I went on medication for it, and then developed OCD which drove me crazy for a few months. I’ve leveled out but still have a feeling like there’s something wrong with me or my life and I don’t know what it is and that scares me. I’ve been in therapy but I don’t think it’s helped with this persistent feeling. Maybe I should up my medication? I’m only 5mg of Lexapro so it’s probably not doing too much for me. I just wanted to know if it was something genuinely wrong with my life that’s causing this feeling or just a chemical imbalance in my brain. I just hate feeling like this. It scares me that I don’t know what’s wrong and it feels like I’ve tried working on my mental health but this just hasn’t changed."
ausername-,depression,1620580759.0,I've always felt so unwanted.,"I've been awake for a little while and I've just been laying here, stewing in depressing thoughts. I got caught up in a pretty bad memory from around 8 or 9 months ago. I was laying in bed with my (at the time) fiance and we were supposed to have a little movie date where we watched stuff together (we were long distance for the first year of our relationship and so these movie dates were very special to us, they're how we initially bonded), and she was just on her phone the whole time (with whom I'd later found out she'd been cheating on me with, and whom she would ultimately end up leaving me for) unaware of my existence. This had become commonplace and it was very distressing for me.

I ended up getting out of bed to go hug our puppy and afterwards I just laid on the floor for a while. It took her ten or twenty minutes to even realize I was out of bed. I was crying quietly. She hugged me and held me for a while and that was nice, but when we got up and got back in bed, she was immediately glued to her phone and oblivious to my existence again. I felt so unwanted.

I've pretty much always felt unwanted. By everybody, all of the time. By friends and family, by the few romantic partners I've ever had. I always feel like a burden, as though my presence is an imposition. Most people often have irritated or outright hostile reactions to my presence - like my mere existence is offensive to them. It's so hard to deal with.

I just wish there was someone excited at the prospect of my existence, someone who reveled in time shared with me. It's so painful to be so unwanted."

Idk what my real problem is. For a while I thought meds made me numb, but either that’s worn off or the problem is just my depression got a lot worse. Lately I deal with crying spells. And I feel it coming on and know it’s going to be tough for a while. Often times crying to family helps, or even just talking to people on discord.

The thing is I think my life has been getting better. I’m working. I feel less dpdr. I have been able to play video games and talk with friends on discord (I thought I was too messed up to seem like my normal self). 

But these thoughts of suicide (nothing specific, just like “will you do this?”) and the general replaying of my life situation is near constant and it’s exhausting. I think it’s obsessive in nature. And I’ve had some times where it went away during playing games or just at times getting lost in an activity. It’s rare tho, and I worry that no matter what I’m always going to have these thoughts about how I’ve lost my old self and one day I may end up ending it all. It brings me to tears to write this. I couldn’t do this to myself or my family. But I’m worried the pressure from it will one day get to me. 

Life has been very weird lately. Especially these last couple days, I don’t know if I’m getting better or not. I was feeling good for a while, but then I felt worse and I wonder if my progress is just “tricking myself” or “pretending”. I just wonder if anyone has dealt with this kind of confusion and unwanted thoughts."

My partner kind of makes me feel worse, I don’t really want to break up but I often wonder if my mental health is becoming worse while in a relationship. I wonder how he feels as well and if we feel the same at times. There’s a handful of situations but for example: 
When I’m depressed I just want to listen to music with earbuds, so I do and for example, I look up and he shakes his head at me and gives me a disappointed look on purpose, 
I’ve asked him to stop manyyy times to stop shaking his head while looking at me because it makes me feel like I did something wrong and frustrated. He doesn’t really say anything at all when i ask him why he’s doing that. Idk I feel like shit I feel even more alone because who wants to share a room with someone who likes to stare down on them and shake their head while they already feel down.

After a depressive episode, I began noticing that I wasn’t as hard anymore when masturbating ( I’ve been doing it twice or thrice a week since I was 13). My semen began to be watery too. At first I thought that it was just due to depression and the side effects of fasting but after it didn’t go away for a week, I began slumping into another depressive time. Even after feeling a bit better these days, I haven’t regained my ability to have erections easily. I can still get hard very quick when it comes to masturbating but the thought of forever being impotent and losing one of life’s greatest joys is just... it’s honestly heartbreaking for me.

When I say it feels like anxiety has ruined my life and my brain, I mean it. I can't even see it when it's there or where it's coming from, because it's everywhere, and I can't see. It has destroyed all my clarity. I feel just so fucking hopeless. I feel like it's not even this creature on my shoulder where I still know who I am or I'm still mostly functioning, it's like it has eaten my brain and destroyed the way I think and behave, like my whole like is one giant bad coping mechanism. I don't know where to begin if I never have clarity. My personality is there, but it's underneath all of this fog. I can't be myself normally because it is always tensing me up and turning my attention back to myself and my brain, causing worry that I have spent years repressing because otherwise it was too overwhelming. I can't even feel properly depressed anymore cause it's like my emotions are in a lock and my brain/thoughts/emotions can move freely and naturally. I need to know there is a way out of this. The thing I think might help but won't be able to get for at least a little while, probably not till next semester is anxiety medication, and hopefully *hopefully* that'll release my brain from some of the tension and I can get more clarity and start to feel real again. But I don't know if that'll work, and I don't want to put all my hopes in that. Not really sure what else to do or if there are things that help people."

I’ve been isolating myself for a week or so now to avoid seeing them. I need out of this house so bad, but have no means to do so. I feel so trapped and utterly alone. 
The only interactions I have with my father is him giving me orders. I’ve never had any kind of emotional intimacy with him. My mom is like a toddler, nice to you only if her mood is right. she can be so cruel when frustrated or upset, she’s called me a loser, an idiot, an asshole, “fuck you”, stupid etc. to my face. then she gets guilty and tries to mend things but the cycle has happened so many times I’m just done with it, I can’t keep letting her back in. She weaponizes my guilt to make me open back up. They’ve both used shame and guilt To control me my entire life. 
My siblings don’t care. They’ve all moved out and have their own lives, jobs, and friends. I feel like an utter failure. I’m nowhere in life. I can’t  see how to continue, I’m useless and have nothing at all going for me. What’s the point. I’ve barely left my bed all week. I feel so stupid"

Lately I've just felt really sad. I feel like there is no one I can count on in my life, everyone always just ends up leaving and that I am largely unhappy. I feel like this way sometimes for a day, sometimes for days, and then it'll go away for a short time before returning.

Lately I feel like it may be worst because I am now feeling like I wish I was dead. However, suicide is not something I'd \*ever\* do. I am very much of the thought process that I'd rather live in pain than not at all and that life is valuable and worth living. So I am not sure why these thoughts keep on popping into my head and why I am feeling this way. I do see a therapist, but I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and able to work through it without medication. I just want to feel I am not alone.

I moved out of my mom's at age 17 into my great grandfather's home because I didn't like how I was being treated by an individual in my mom's home. That was a really rough time because I had also being suffering from possibly a psychotic break due to my severe OCD and anxiety. I left on a whim late one night with nothing but the clothes on my back and that was my last day living there. I had no money because I have been having to pay for a lot of my own stuff since I was 15 and also tend to shop a lot because I feel it will make me feel better. I was able to get all of my belongings about a month later, but that wasn't the end of this nightmare. As soon as I was to turn 18, I had to start paying for all of my own stuff and was forced into adulthood and back to work while I was still intensely sick. This caused me to miss multiple days of work and ended in a termination. I had been there for 2 years. After getting fired, I decided to take the time to figure myself out and practice some self care. Living in my great grandfather's basement was NOT the best, but I decided to give it a deep clean to make it my own. My mattress was directly on the basement floor because I didn't have a frame, and when I lifted it to clean the floor underneath I discovered mold. We decided it was coming from the walls and proceeded to rip the walls out. To make sure I didn't have mold in my foam mattress, we removed the top cover and a cheese like netting around the mattress to inspect it. Turns out, this netting was made almost entirely of fiberglass. Fiberglass got embedded into everything I own. I had to sell my truck to afford a new mattress because the old one was coated in glass. My clothes still have shards in them to this day. Now, the new vehicle I got is in need of new tires and something is out of wack with the engine. I am trying to get a job but it's hard when my depression makes me want to just lay down and die. I did just get food stamps so at least theres that.

This whole experience has been completely overwhelming and it just seems to be one thing after another. Shortly after moving out I fell into a deep depression and I'm just wondering if life will always be this way?

I really wanted to kill myself and I almost called a suicide hotline. I had never felt more alone in my life. I always thought my dad and my brother would be there for me but they don't care.

I am so toxic to myself that I feel like I'm slowly killing whoevers left. These intense flashbacks and me zoning out and feeling down scares me and has to stop... I've been conditioned to hide my emotions and I think I've been doing it well so far, but sometimes I'm scared I'll just break down completely and I'll do something bad. I just grew up into hating myself and feeling like the most worthless and useless person, proudly telling myself everyday how worthless, ugly, and disgusting I am. I just don't know what to do and I don't want to tell anyone I know because I'm embarrassed. But it hits me so hard sometimes and I get so scared. If I can relive my life again I would do anything to do so."

To be honest im not really sure if I have a problem or not because I normally get incredibly sad or i guess depressed? when I drink a lot but when im sober i am normally normal enough that I have no problems operating.  My issue i think is every-ime i get drink I want to self harm and the last few times iver scratched myself with a thumb tack or heated the tip of a needle to burn myself. Do you think im just craving attention or maybe just the endorphin rush becuase I only do it when im drunk? I think im fine when i dont drink so obviosuly i need to stop but i cant because i am bored and my friends basically dont talk to me anymore so its the only pass time i have. Idk hahaha"

Mr_Hans_Moleman,depression,1620650351.0,"No matter what, I never feel good enough.","On paper, my life seems pretty great. I own a home, I'm married to an amazing wife (she's probably the only reason I'm still here), I don't want for much and I have plenty of nice new stuff. But I always feel like I don't deserve it. The main reason is my career. I graduated college a year ago, but I'm still working the grocery store job I've had since I was 18. It pays the bills and I'm comfortable there, but I feel like I'm wasting my life. I'm watching all my friends who graduated with me get ""big boy"" jobs making $60k+ a year, and even kids I knew in HS who never went to college doing well, and I'm still getting by on $14 an hour. 

I tried a couple management jobs and never made it far because of my extreme lack of confidence and social anxiety. One was an internship which I failed pretty miserably (did not get a job offer at the end), which ended up wrecking what little confidence I did have, and the other was a management job at the store where I work, that I ended up stepping down from because I was having panic attacks and doubting myself so badly even though logically I probably would have done fine. So I ended up back in my same bottom of the chain clerk position doing nothing with my life. 

I just feel like I'm stuck now, I want to start a career, make enough so that my wife and I can start a family, and I also worry that someday she might start seeing me as a loser because I'm not moving up in the world anywhere. But my already extremely low self esteem and confidence is too wrecked by my past failures to try anything. At this point I feel like I suck even at my current job and I worry that if I ever lose it I won't even be able to find something that good again. 

Idk, I'm just a depressed mess and need to vent. Thanks for listening reddit people."

I don’t wanna have anything to do with my current psychiatrist because my experience with her and perhaps the whole team she’s in has been one of painful disillusionment. They’re just watching as I’m fading away. I need a counsellor who’s either a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist who deals with cases of severe depression. If I can’t get a public one I’ll pay up for a private one. One session and some questionnaires is better than nothing. 
FOR THAT I NEED TO KNOW HOW TO FIND ONE ONLINE

I may have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia; in fact the whole thing was shady to me from the start. I’d say 50/50 chance but pretty shady. 

Knowing what I know, I have no reason to change the dose of antipsychotics I’m currently on. They all disable me and make me suicidal and there’s no need for them because I don’t have delusions. And no the brain fog doesn’t go away in time. This is an undocumented truth. AP’s make your mood worse unless maybe you have delusions, trouble sleeping, or violent schizophrenia related hallucinations which I don’t. 

I’m upping my Effexor just a little but that’s just because of how desperate I am. 

My stressors are:
People (everyone)
My mother
My neighbors
The city I live in cause it’s where I’ve lived all my life since 4
Having to leave my apartment and deal with people to shop for necessities
Not knowing what to do given antipsychotics and antidepressants haven’t worked out
Knowing I’ll have to work again someday and that means having to deal with people
Not knowing my I.Q.

What I want to do is figure out if I have PTSD, especially if I have PTSD related to my childhood or other people. I’m not upping any medication except for Effexor. 

I believe I’ve been a victim of sadism, but I’m not sure what happened exactly. I’m gonna have to document heavily to find out if that’s the case.

When it comes to people I don’t know if I exposure helps or if the whole idea is just wish fulfillment.

Basically I think I’m gonna be depressed for a very long time, but if I can learn how to deal with other people, then the fact of being depressed will be easier to deal with.

Most of all, I need somebody who’s gonna keep me from making bad decisions that are gonna screw up my life.

I need suggestions. Everything you need to know is in the title. Thank you."

The one with the most disability was diagnosed with Down syndrome shortly after birth. I grieved the loss of the daughter I thought I was going to have, but for her sake tried to get over it and focus on why everyone reassured me, how high functioning people with Down syndrome can be. Everyone floods you in the beginning with positivity and support and great stories about high functioning people with Ds. And over the next weeks, months and years my hopes have one by one been crushed. Every new medical problem is another disappointment that she will ha e to deal with and most likely shorten her lifespan and quality of life. 
Now i have her teachers and school therapists telling me at age 7 she doesn’t belong in the regular school, where her brother goes, and they keep pushing her into a “life skills” class in another town. Meanwhile she has never had a full school day anywhere, and they are writing her off at the age of 7 and all their reasoning has to do with their convenience. I read up and ALL the evidence overwhelming
Fly supports inclusion in regular classes as best for all but the 1% at the lowest functioning level. And it’s better for the special Ed student and their typical peers. 
My husband thinks I am the one overreacting and maybe they are right. Which just makes me want to give the fuck up. If I didn’t know losing me would hurt my kids so much, I would have already killed myself.

I knew this kid who killed himself right after we graduated high school and I think about all the things he missed out on since 2003.

I think about my son, how he might feel, how awful he'd feel, the tears he's shed. I think about my infant daughter, growing up without a father.

Honestly, from the shit I've been going through, I wouldn't mind dying at any time of the day for any reason. Heck, most of the time I just do the stuff that seems productive to pass the time so I can just sleep and look forward to dying in my sleep (even if it sounds like a pipe dream).

That is not the case. My husband and I recently bought our first home and boom all of the sudden the nighttime depression is back in full swing. We have lived several different places before and this never has seemed to impact me, but something now is causing a comeback.

So for some context, I'm a 23 y/o female and over the last 6 months I've been having pretty bad depression - I never really felt this way in the past and I didn't have a triggering event that caused the depression, it just sort of happened gradually. 

I've always been a bubbly, laughable person and I have a real interest in psychology. I have lots of self-improvement books and enjoy yoga/meditation but since this depression started I just have not been motivated to do any of these things, which sounds silly since it would make such a difference, but it's just the way it is... I've noticed that my mood gets really low on Sunday evening, Mondays and Tuesdays and then picks up again from maybe Wednesday to Sunday morning. 

Yesterday I was with my boyfriend all day and was having a great time just being in his company, but as soon as it was time to go home my mood just instantly flipped and I got really down. This is the first time I've noticed such an instant change in my mood but it's made me realise that there must be a problem with me maybe spending time with myself? I mean I don't have harmful thoughts or anything, but it's almost as if something is missing, and whenever I'm with my boyfriend I don't 'notice' that there's something missing. 

It's hard for me to notice anything that's wrong or where my depression has come from because as I said above there was no triggering event, so something has gone wrong somewhere down the line.

Is there anyone out there who can relate to this at all, or any advice would be appreciated. 

Thanks guys"

kittykatr427,depression,1620436737.0,I had forgotten what it felt like to NOT want to die,"I(25F) have struggled with suicidal thoughts and major depression since high school. The past year was really tough, and I thought about suicide almost constantly. There was a string of really messy relationship drama and I felt like I was losing everything. I have recently come to accept it and realize that I was never really happy with him, I just thought I was because I hadn't been happy without him, either. I had a lot of family and friends help me out in the toughest moments, and luckily no permanent harm was done.

This past week I was driving around and I realized that I hadn't thought about killing myself or dying in months. Prior to this I hadn't gone more than a few days without wanting to die, and I can't remember ever wanting to live in the past 8 years. I was able to think about suicide and immediately go into that headspace; I knew why I wanted it, how much I wanted it, and at a moment's notice I could feel the suicidal pull. I could immediately empathize with other depressed or suicidal people. But now I feel like I couldn't even feel that depressed if I wanted to. It's like those thoughts are out of reach.

My ex was telling me about how his mistress mentioned thinking she'd be better off dead once or twice after he broke things off with her, and I responded that if I only think that twice a day then it's a rare, good day. To me, every day would inevitably bring thoughts that death would be a sweet release, and I couldn't even see how for others those thoughts would be concerning. And I was so used to the constant nagging thoughts of death that I wasn't even aware of how unhealthy it was.

When I realized I had stopped feeling that way, it was like I could see a whole other world. It hasn't drastically changed my outlook, more like little things I changed have led to me not feeling that way. I feel like I can now see ""how the other half lives"" and understand how hard it is for someone who has never experienced depression or suicidal thoughts to get how it feels."

I am writing proposals left and right on Upwork to get more jobs. I wish I could invest money into my business but due to the situation in the house I just never have anything left over. Life is just really hard right now. I am always thinking about our next meal and money. I am praying I get more work soon because I really need it. Since I haven't gotten paid yet I won't be able to buy groceries tomorrow until next week Thursday, so the next few days will be very tough, but we have learned to survive on water from time to time. Living hand to mouth everyday is really upsetting and I don't wish this sort of life on anyone.  I completely understand that many people aren't doing well financially since covid begun so naturally alot of people are depressed and I have no right to complain as I am sure many people have it harder than me.

I’m so exhausted. I grew up fundamentalist, and my narcissist mom made me hate myself for who I am and what I like. Constantly making me feel like shit. Tried to escape to college and be a “good Christian” by going to a Christian college. Realized I am pansexual and an atheist and tried to kms. Didnt work, switched schools and got diagnosed with OCD and bipolar type 1. Somehow graduated with a degree I don’t care about and started getting my masters because I didn’t know what else to do. Started dating a guy who made two different dating profiles and reached out to escorts behind my back. Got so depressed I’m failing school. My job that pays for school doesn’t have enough funds to keep me on board for the summer. Boyfriend keeps trying to convince me he has changed and I mean something to him but everyone in my life has betrayed me and I know I don’t matter to any of them unless I’m right in front of them and can serve them somehow. I am broke as shit and depend on my bf. I don’t see a way out of any of it, and I’m too tired to keep going. I can’t see my counselor because they were at the school and I can’t attend for the summer. I can’t do this. I’m too ugly and undesirable and stupid and bad at shit for this world. I don’t even know how I found the energy to type this or why I even bother. Feel like I’m already dead and frankly wish I was. Called my mom for Mother’s Day and she was crying and is disappointed in me. My bf doesn’t want to be around me and just guilted me for eating to much of our groceries even though I’m recovering from an ED so that’s hella triggering. I’m a fucking burden and I want out

1_pasta_1,depression,1620549232.0,I hate the fact that you have to wait until you're 25-30 to finally get help,"I have had depression since I was 7-10 years old and I always wanted to have someone to help me deal with it, I got to post on facebook at that age that I wanted to commit suicide, many people responded to that post and my parents forced me to delete it and hit me Without asking myself the reason why I did that (bullying, domestic violence, etc.) and since then I decided to completely hide my depression and now 9 years later and a suicide attempt I don't think I can bear another 6 years to finally disappear completely, go to therapy and completely rebuild my life. Well, the only thing that motivates me not to commit suicide (again) is that my younger sister also has depression and that strangers from the internet that I will never know support me to continue alive

edit: Why the title? Why wait until you are 25?

Many of us cannot just go to therapy or tell someone ""hey I have depression and I need professional help"" (without ending up receiving the same empty and stupid words ""you don't need therapy"" ""you are not depressed you are just lazy"", etc) or go for Itself, since the main factors are not having money, not having a means of transportation and / or being in a toxic environment, so you have to wait at that age to live alone and finally repair all the damage that you have been accumulating"
Purdybranch1,depression,1620613194.0,It’s worse than ever,"When I (F21) was 15 (2015) I was diagnosed with depression after trying to end my life. I got the help I needed and got better. A couple years ago I stopped going to therapy and weaned myself off my meds. Don’t get me wrong, I still have my days/weeks but I have done amazing things since then and I’m so proud of myself and how far I’ve come. 

Recently, those bad days/weeks turned into months. Since January I have been on an downwards spiral and I think I’ve hit rock bottom.

January: It started off by being overworked (60 hour weeks on my feet the entire time). I told my boss multiple times I couldn’t do these hours anymore as I was too tired and my body couldn’t handle it. She told me to drink some coffee and deal with it. That went on for 2 months before I mustered up the courage to quit. 

March: I had a good week after that and then I was right back to being depressed. My boyfriend, who I live with, told me he didn’t think he could handle being there for me once he starts school in the fall along with work. I applied to 30 jobs over the next month with no calls back. 

April: I had the idea to start a reselling business. I really enjoyed it but it hardly brought in the profit I wanted. My boyfriend brings up not being able to be there for me again and I gave him the opportunity to end things. He said he didn’t want to and sees a future with me. I was happy he wanted that. An old coworker texts me saying her mom wanted me to come work for her and I started immediately. I’m doing great at this point, things are looking up!

The night before my first day my boyfriend was acting weird. I was overthinking and searched his phone(something I’ve never done before, I just had a feeling). I found nudes of one of his coworkers. He said she sent those out of nowhere and he didn’t want to make things at work weird so he didn’t block her or acknowledge them. He begged me not to leave him and apologized profusely.

May: I’ve been struggling horribly since then with trust issues. I looked through his phone again and found flirty texts with a different coworker that seemed inappropriate to me but he insisted they were innocent. He’s visiting his dying grandfather in a different state this weekend so I have the house to myself.

I’ve enjoyed the time to process everything and figure out how I feel but now I’ve never felt more alone in my life. I’m absolutely heartbroken and all I want is to be held and comforted while I cry and I have no one. I reached out to a friend who’s always been there but it didn’t help. All I want is my boyfriend. Before all this we had an amazing relationship and he’s been my rock for so long. He doesn’t come home for a couple more days and I don’t think I can make it.

The only thing I have going for me anymore is this job. I know I need help again but I don’t know how to get it."

BlueBerryMiAmor,depression,1620443861.0,Need Some Input on Citalopram,"Background: early 30s, patterns of binge drinking, have always had trouble sleeping, but not what I would consider depression. Love exercising, very social, and throughly enjoy my job.

So I went to my primary care physician recently for my annual checkup/bloodwork. All was fine. I do say when I drink heavily, the nights following make it very, very difficult to fall asleep at a reasonable time. Melatonin doesn't really help: usually I can fall asleep but wake up about an hour later. 

We discussed some medications and he suggested citalopram. Had never heard of it and he said he sees it as an '3-in-one' type medication: for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I can be anxious at times (alcohol certainly doesn't help), but have never seen myself as depressed or experiencing depression.

Thoughts on this drug for what I've described? Very weary of taking meds in general, and idk, this one just doesn't seem right for me.

kem343,depression,1620590251.0,No more silence,"Hey everyone. I’m writing this on Mother’s Day so Happy Mother’s Day to all the mommas! 

Before I share my story I want to warn some people that it is very disturbing, and violent so if you have a weak heart or underage don’t read. 

Growing up I was very shy, I later realized it was social anxiety; but was always very polite and sweet. The abuse started when I was 4, my cousin was around 14 at the time and he always touched me in weird ways. He would ask me if I felt good. I felt uncomfortable but he started to tell me that he loves me and not to tell anyone or else they would hurt me. 

It escalated and he and his brother AND their friends would touch me. Sometimes they would put their finger in me so hard that I would cry and they would hold my mouth, tell me they were sorry and give me a lollipop.  I’m not sure how but eventually the parents found out. They cried and held me and told my mother, somehow my older brother heard and got into a huge fight with our cousin which resulted to police coming over. Never seen each spoke to that family again. 

I would like to say that is the end of that but 5 more of my relatives abused me repeatedly from age 4-13. I ended up telling my brother because I trusted him and he asked me how they touched me and ended up doing the same when mom I want around. My brother is 8 years older then me and eventually 4 of his friends started to touch me and hurt me as well. They would say “I heard your brother put his finger inside, did you like it”. They would touch me behind his back and infront of him. He didn’t care about me.

This part is the worst. When I was 11 I was walking home from school and was passing one of my brothers friends house. He seen me and told me that he wanted to show me something so I went inside. He told me to get on the bed and lay down. Touched me a little bit and actually put his private part in slowly. I screamed and started to cry and his mom was just coming in and I will never forget the face of shock she had. She started screaming, crying and hitting him. She called him disgusting and told me she was so sorry. She asked me if I could keep this a secret and ofc I said yes. They believed me because I never spoke. 

I could go on for days about how many times I’ve been touched. I tried to kill myself I prayed to god to make an accident happen to me. I’m 25 years old with no relationship to my family, I know they remember and they don’t want to see me. Around 30 people have hurt me when I was a kid and my mother has never actually talked to me about it. Mothers, fathers, caregivers please be careful because you never know who to trust. Watch out for the signs because I’m 25 and I still shake, I’m still scared and I do remember. I don’t wish this feeling on anyone but I finally opened up to my boyfriend and it felt good to tell someone. I will confront them one day."

itsrin17_,depression,1620613833.0,What has me depressed today.,"Please don't be too harsh on me. I have a husky I got when I was 12. There was a lot of things going on in my life like my parent's divorce a couple of years later and divorce. I developed anxiety and depression disorder and had to go to mental facilities multiple times. We had my dog and sometimes we would let her go to my Nana's with her dogs for maybe a week or sometimes a month but still visit her. She had a bigger yard she could run and she enjoyed staying with my Nana.  At some point we tried to rehome her. When we went we noticed some aggressiveness with one of their dogs with my husky. They said they couldn't keep her after awhile but she eventually came home with us. This was in middle school. I am now 20 and have had her since. Even though it was ""my dog"" my parents never did extra training with her when I was a child. I did do some training with her when I was a kid though. When she was a puppy and my parents did take her to a dog training place before. My dog is a very good dog though. She isn't aggressive, she is healthy, she is friendly, she is good with kids. She is 9 now and when most people see her they think she is a puppy or younger. She is average 50 pounds for a female husky but most people think she is really small. Even though our vet has said nothing about it. She does have separation anxiety though. At the time at my age we didn't give her the training she needs to be okay in her crate. I feel bad even though I was a child for not finding the proper resources to train her for that. She is okay now with her separation anxiety when being left at home. Our older dog died almost two years ago around my husky's b day. My husky didn't like to be without her. We also have a cat. Even though my cat dislikes my dog they are still okay with each other. I think having my cat is what keeps her calm at home when we leave. She used to not be able to sleep alone but now instead of sleeping with me she sleeps downstairs by herself sometimes which is good.  We had some issues with her using the bathroom I'm the house due to urine incontinence but it is slowly getting resolved. Sometimes she is disobedient and will not do what I ask if she sees she will not be rewarded with a treatment she is very food motivated. Sometimes I do just feel guilty though for not training her enough. She does have good life though and goes on road trips, car rides, has dog friends to play with and things like that. I felt guilty because sometimes she escapes out of the house or sometimes I trust her a bit too much and she takes off. Not around the neighborhood but sometimes she will do a lap around the hosue or go on one of our neighbors yards. Our neighbors dog comes over to our house too because my older dog that  used to be best friends and they would run to each others houses at the porches or front doors. We have a mini park in the back with some woods. Sometimes when it is dark around closing time for the park I would let her off leash to get a run in. I've seen other people do it in the morning or at night. Usually if there is a person she keeps distance and I tell her to go home. She will usually go home to our front door. I've been trying to train her off leash but because of her personality sometimes I can't always trust that she will keep her distance from unexpected oncoming people. So there have bee mn some embarrassing moments. Sometimes I dont know what I was thinking but instead I've been taking her to dog parks bit she is a little uncomfy with bigger dogs being in her face, so she will do a little air nip to some dogs to give her some space. Somtimes she also puts down her tail so she wont be smelled, but will smell other dogs. I don't take her as much but sometimes but she does enjoy it when meeting other people. I have seen her play a bit with some of the smaller dogs which makes me happy. It is also weird with recall because everytime I go to a dog park even the really large ones she listens to my recall without hesitation but at home or around my hosue it is a different story. I also felt bad because one of my aunts came over and my husky was trying to smell her after they came in. I didn't know she was afraid of dogs. I kind of wish that they told me that they were coming over because it was unexpected. My dog didn't want tk be put away and was crying when I put her outside. She doesn't get jumpy with guests for like she curious or wants to be acknowledged. I feel bad for not training her more on it but it never came into my mind since we have never had a problem with guests over because she is usually good and after awhile she minds her business. I want to train her to do better but it's going to be hard to find sometimes to try and pretend to be a ""guest ringing the door bell everyday so she will get it. I dont know but its just been weighing  on my mind today and making me depressed for not being better. I did train her today and she did well and hopefully throughout the week and slowly lean off it. I am trying to be better. I didn't want to post it on the dogs reedit because I feel like I would be labeled as a terrible owner. I don't think i am. I just know I can be better."
drksyd345,depression,1620586864.0,Anyone have experience with IF and/or supplements helping depression?,"I’m wondering if anyone here has experience with doing intermittent fasting and it helping ease their depression? I did IF for several years and fell off of it when
I became depressed and then starting taking an antidepressant that made me nausea and felt I needed to have something in my stomach to absorb it. I am desperately looking for anything to help me feel better as medication is not working for me. I’m just wondering if IF may help a little. One plus it would have if I start up again is one less opportunity to eat crap at a meal. I used to be such a healthy eater and since entering the worse bout of depression of my life earlier this year, I’ve only managed to be able to feed myself nutritionally void meals of mostly starch, fat, sugar, etc. I also rely on takeout a lot and want nothing more than to start eating healthier again as I am hopeful it will help my energy levels, outlook, etc. 

I’ve also been researching supplements that may help with depression, including saffron, EPA fish oil, vitamin D, zinc, turmeric and magnesium. Would love to hear any experiences with any of these as well."

Everyday is fucking awful. Everything only gets worse. I have nothing to look forward to other than more pain and suffering. I know that there are a lot of people that are in a lot worse scenarios, but I just can’t take it anymore. I don’t really have any friends, I don’t have a girlfriend, I’m 5’6, I’m overweight, I’m ugly, I’m not that smart, I don’t have any talents, and I have no social skills to go with my social anxiety. I just feel worse everyday and I really don’t know how much longer i can take it. Even when i’m around people i still feel so alone. it doesn’t matter. i’ll never be good enough for anyone or anything. I don’t even do anything anymore. I just spend hours doing absolutely nothing not being able to sleep and just contemplating ending my life. I almost killed myself a few days ago, but in the end i just couldn’t do it, because i know everyone is going to be even more disappointed in me. I fucked up everything, i don’t see a future where i’m actually happy. I’m such a pathetic excuse for a human being and i’m honestly just a waste of space. I wish i could at least do something right and just end my life. All the stress from school and all the other dumb shit is all for absolutely nothing. why should i wait and suffer for the rest of my life when i can just end it now? no one will ever truly love or care about me. no one gives a shit about me, including me. i really just don’t have any motivation to keep living."
Yoshiiboy123,depression,1620502332.0,"Oh yeah, the urge to make another depressing reddit post has returned","The title speaks for itself to an extent. Today is not a good day. I haven't posted on Reddit in a while, I was using it as a way to try to get support from strangers, after all, I would never meet them so it didnt matter what I said. One of my friends found my reddit account and asked if I was okay. so that wasnt good, I hadnt posted in a while so I managed to get them to leave the topic. and then recently my mum implied that I would end up in a psychiatric ward because of self harming, and then I would have horrible, shameful scars on my arms for the rest of my life, and I would be in my mid twenties or thirties, embarrased with makeup on my arms. Fear has always been a motivator for me. It got me to start self harming, and this got me to stop. I promised her I would never do it again, and she refused to believe me, saying that it had become a habit. I am so much stronger than that, it doesnt feel like it right now, but I know I am.

Anyway, to get to the point of the depressing reddit post. I had a little mini-meltdown last night, (maybe because I lost my one coping mechanism, who really knows?) told one of my friends how I was feeling and I felt so disgusted with myself. they have shared problems and things with me before, but it just felt wrong. All of my life I have held my tongue, and been silent. it makes things easier in the short term, but in the long term it makes things worse. I never asked for help for anything, and now I cant ask for help. Ive felt sick and disgusted with myself all day. I want to talk to them more, because it was quite nice to share my feelings for once, but I was in a particularly vulnerable position last night, and I dont want to burden them with this, so I was thinking of waiting some time before talking with them about it again, but I dont really know."
AddendumImpossible,depression,1620568725.0,Seeking Help,How do you deal with situations where you have a goal which you always wanted to achieve and your parents just tell you that you are never gonna get it
CalmRich123,depression,1620472106.0,"I planned on killing myself tonight. With encouragement from someone on reddit, I called a medical centre, visited them, and talked with me for an hour. They assessed me and are going to ring me tomorrow with a plan. I kinda wish I killed myself.","I wasn’t doing very well in high school. At 15, my mother pushed me to drop out of school for community college, but I wanted to change from the private school to the public school. I was bullied at school and unsafe at home. I was screamed at regularly and pushed for it.

I changed schools. It was a better environment for me and it was a disaster but I kept resisting my mother’s attempts to kick me out of school - because I believed leaving school means you failed at life. I kept conflicting with my parents and getting counsellors to intervene to speak for my interests.

I left school with no qualifications.

At 18, I was suicidal. My mother didn’t believe me, went ""boo-hoo you have it so tough"" when I was on antidepressant withdrawals, refused to support me for medication, tried to push me to stop taking them without any medical assistance. A counsellor saw the situation getting out of hand and had to intervene.

I did one art course I didn’t want to do. I was screamed at for asking to change.

Left that, did a university preparation course. My mother threatened to cancel this course on me - pretending she has any control over my life. I was very destructive and hurtful for others, I seeked out toxic sites for information on how to navigate life. Was hurtful, immature, lost a lot of friends. In one class, I was texting a support text number. The teacher didn't want me texting in class, took me out of the class to ask why I won't stop, I told her I was texting a counsellor about suicidal ideation, and she ended the class and took me to hospital.

I passed first semester of university preparation, then failed the second twice.

After that, 20 was the age anyone can go. My mother pushed me into another art degree I didn’t want to do. I did a year of it confused, left after a year. I was being targeted online and it affected me more intensely than the average person. An ongoing repetitive obsession. People were falsely accusing me on crimes over Facebook. I would feel intense emotions and leave class early to go home, struggle to sleep. My counsellor got sick of me, dismissed my concerns, called me autistic. I later learned a counsellor isn't qualified to make an assessment like that and I believe this was a malpractice.

When I asked for a diagnosis after being called autistic, they referred me to a facility. The facility asked for my story, I told them, and they said ""sorry, we only deal with serious situations."" This means I never was able to find out who I am.

Started a degree I wanted to do at 21. Cheated my way through the year.

Then I got depressed and dropped out. Spent a year on the welfare, with intense trauma from my past experiences. Welfare recommended me to a supermarket job so I did that in 2019. I kept talking to myself, was very depressed, couldn’t cope with it. Eventually they had to take me hospital because I was very suicidal and they could sense it. I did door to door sales for a few weeks then left. Being called autistic, I found depressing statistics around autism (unemployment, suicidal ideation, divorce, etc.) and it made me feel hopeless, I found incel forums which reinforced these feelings.

While I was on the welfare and working at the supermarket, I cut off contact with my mother. My sister thought I was blaming her and ""not being an adult"" but I disagree. My sister has gotten vicious over it. My sister is blindly ignoring clear wrongdoing. Even if I graduated by now, I'd still have issues with her and a desire to cut her off.

My mother felt like she failed as a mother and was very upset. My mother and father recognise wrongdoing, but it is mainly because me cutting off family caused distress. All my mother would think about is how she lost her son and it upset her.

Did a year of uni online, got the paper I missed in my time before.

Then in second year but not sure if I should be doing this because I cheated in the first. And in general I just feel like a total disaster and failure.

I’m 25 and experiences from high school and 15 years old still affect me. Trauma blows, man.

I feel a great deal of annoyance at myself. I repeatedly fought for opportunities, then spoiled them when I got them. I put no effort towards school or university, and often was very destructive and hurtful. I have justified reason to be angry at my parents, but when the pain softens, I'm left with a disappointment in myself. I screwed my life up. I got every opportunity I fought for and screwed it up.

I also know what needs to be done. I would need to come to terms with what has happened, accept it, accept I can't change. Accepting the past will be a daily challenge that gets easier over time. I will need to accept life will always be challenging and I will always be a bit neurotic — talking to myself, consistent ruminations on past experiences and people from my past, a slight degree of social awkwardness/strangeness — but regular challenges with neurosis would not make you uncommon. Understand while your parents fucked you over, they do support you know and corrected their wrongs - there are many parents who wouldn't be willing to.

I would need to start my Computer Science degree from scratch. Either admit to my university the situation, while willing to take any potential blowback or bad marks I get, or start over at another university. Do not spend time focusing on what you could or couldn't have done, but instead just rigorously and persistently focus on the task at hand.

It then raises the question of if I can be bothered starting a degree from scratch. To some degree, even if I know the answers to my problems, there is a big part of me that can't be bothered.

I haven't been able to study effectively and couldn't cope with full-time work, so that renders me useless in the world.

Anyway. It is late and I wanted to get my feelings out there.

I'm saw a General Practitioner to talk about diagnosis. They are referring me to a psychologist who could take weeks to get back to me. I think there is a good chance I have an undiagnosed mental illness which has been getting in the way of me functioning properly. Being diagnosed could help me understand myself and learn how to navigate things better. But even then, I could just end up going through more dogshit and false hope. Every day when I look at social media, I feel like a depressing failure."
amanda1o12,depression,1620496937.0,Question about Zoloft,"So I recently started Zoloft for my depression and I was just curious if anyone else felt almost eccentric on it?

h2omelons24,depression,1620630456.0,Old feeling revisited,"On Oct 11, 2015, I saved a note on my phone. Almost six years later, I’ve found this note again and feel so connected with this note. 

I know I'm not okay, I hope I'm gonna be okay. It's okay not to feel okay. It feels like I've given up, I let my insecurities get the best of my abilities I want to go on and try for myself, fight for myself but right now I can't. Take my wrists because I can't move them on my own. I need someone to guide me on my way, to encourage me on my way, to hold me when I stray from clarity. Oh sweet clarity, once when I was so certain of my destiny, of the path I wanted to take, nothing stood in my way, the obstacles I had to face seemed so minuscule. It's so naive to think inside this little bubble, but I can't blame myself when I sought out for something more because all my life I had known so little and wanted so much more. I needed to burst that bubble to learn if I was going to finally breathe or if it was to leave me gasping for air. I loved passionately for the first time, I soared across the sky for the first time, and for the first time I fell and couldn't rise to my feet on my own. I have never failed and failure was not the fondest of my memories. It was unfamiliar and it scared me how unpredicted this came and how little I knew about it. I climbed each day, still with a bruised heart, to make it across the finish line. I finished, Yet it didn't feel honest. Looking back, These new experiences were necessary for my growth, that I can understand but what I can't get over the most is how little I did this for my own, how unaware I was of the hurt it was causing me inside. How wrong it feels now and how lost I find myself. What is there now? What's to become of me after all these years of fighting for one thing, that now doesn't feel rightfully mine? I've grown so detached, and it ponders the question of when did I lose my desire, when did the fire inside me die? It's wrong of me to live my life seeking approval when all this time I should have learned to defend my own character and desires. Reality stroked me hard because I didn't account for factors that may interrupt my well-being, my self-worth, my youth, and I closed myself off to emotions because I considered myself to hold mechanical features, but it's apparent that I'm no machine, and I have a soul to care for. What's left of me is just a self conscious human being living with the same vulnerabilities as my peers. From this point, I know I have to fight it, but it's hard. It's so much easier to be numb. It's so much easier to wallow away and avoid the pain. I don't want to have to answer questions right now. I need to figure this stuff out. I want time to stop for a moment without hurting anyone, to use this time to reflect and make new revelations, to make new goals, to strive for self improvement , to be happy, and to be okay. I know I'm not okay, take me for who I am right now, because I'm still dealing with all these new emotions, this uncontrolled environment, and although I wish I could bring the change to make me happy, it's a process and it's definitely not one I can do on my own. The support of my family would be appreciated, and as a family I want what's best for all of us, and I apologize if I got caught up in what's best for me.  I know by helping myself out is going to help them out, but that's hard to believe when I don't see them wanting that change."

There have been plenty of times where I didn’t think I was going to see 40, and after the changes I’ve made in the last year or so, I was happy to turn 40. But this week just reminded me of all the shit that made me depressed in the first place.  
  
I’m a teacher. Again. I quit 10 years ago and I decided to come back because 1) chemistry temp jobs are a joke and 2) I had to do something during the pandemic to help. And this was Teacher Appreciation Week here in the States. I didn’t become a teacher again to be liked, but it’d be nice. Maybe they should consider moving it to a week where the kids aren’t checked out already.  Didn’t help that my friend (also a teacher) posted a care package from his wife, full of his favorite snacks and breakfast bars. I got a scalp massager and got excited because now I don’t have to pay SportClips the extra $5 so they can do it.
  
With things opening up even a little, I wanted to mark the occasion (with masks, obviously). But it started to feel a little bit like the episode of The Office where Michael organizes all these things for his birthday and the only one enjoying it is him. Not to mention, why set up something when 90% of the people I invite will cancel the day of anyway? 

I have no holidays left. Both my parents have passed, and I don’t have kids, so Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas (Mom also died two weeks before Christmas, too.), any of the fun ones...gone. They’re just days to me now.  
  
I know it’s some paranoid notion that I feel like no one cares, but the older I get, the more real it gets. Everyone’s got their own lives and spouses and kids to care for. I have an unsuccessful dating app run every few months between depression episodes. Why should I care if no one else does?"

duck9415,depression,1620549289.0,I don’t know if this is normal,"So I have been just feeling bad without reasons. Recently I got into some program along with a friend and I am just doing it because I think it’s interesting and I dont really know what else Id do with my life. But now this friend is acting off like I am a burden and she is really subtle. I cleared things but I had a really bad night. I couldn’t stop crying and just really hated this person. Honestly I have never taken this person too seriously before and it’s always been kinda meh. I have started being a bit vulnerable recently as in since a year or two. I just felt really shaky and weird. This has never happened to me over something so trifle. I am sure I am not explaining it right. I have been diagnosed with depression earlier but I dont have any therapy or medications going on. Also I kinda hated people like really hated them as in my friends who were busy and they didn’t know anythings up with me. As I said I am not the kinda person who has been very open in the past so it is difficult and people will not have a clue. I feel like I am insane and push people away and I don’t know what to do.

Sorry for such a scattered post and grammar mistakes."

Misty__IV,depression,1620460396.0,I Am A Disappointment To My Father,"Let me just say my relationship with my father went downhill when I was about 8.  He was having problems with his own parents and that created problems within our relationship.  I was a daddy's girl before then.

The actual 'verbal abuse' started in the beginning of the 7th grade.  I'd turned 13 and started wearing black band tees and chopped my hair at about shoulder length (parents thought it was too short but were ok with it for the time being) anyways, the first 2 months of school that year became a total nightmare.  My dad started suddenly telling me that I looked like a weirdo and that kids at school probably saw me that way to.  He'd give long lectures about my style and how no ones gonna wanna marry a girl who dresses the way I do, but the way he spoke to me always felt like the way a father would speak to his rebelious son.  Just his tone and constant swearing.  Idk.  Btw my sister was the one who got me into that emo style/culture and actually sported a haircut similar to mine, but much longer, so she didn't get much of the same treatment. 

And I mean, I get it.  Even I still cringe at the style I had back then, but looking back, I don't think the way he spoke to me was the way a father should ever speak to his own daughter.  I wonder if he acts that way towards me because maybe he wishes he had a son, but instead ended up with me?  Everyone did assume I'd be a boy before my mom had me.  I am also certainly the tomboy of the sisters. Maybe that says something?  Either way, I hate the way he speaks to me.  He has often told me I should be more feminine and whatnot.  Not in a creepy way but in more of a ""why can't you just be a normal daughter"" type of way.  How can I feel feminine when you make fun of my style, call me a ""fucking weirdo"", constantly tell me to ""be normal"" and ask me if theres something wrong with me mentally?  A lot of kids go through stupid phases, but both my parents, mainly dad, made me feel as though it was much deeper than that.  I remember them telling me ""you'll never be successful if you continue dressing that way"".  They were truly disappointed in me.  A 13 year old girl, still going through puberty, starting to compare herself to other girls, starting to have her own insecurities, and on top of that... having her own father insult her looks and speak to her as though he's speaking with a grown man, thinking that maybe it'll get her to stop dressing that way and finally be normal.  Let's just say it made me look and feel even less feminine. 

I ended up cutting my hair into a pixie (kept the bangs long due to insecurities) and my parents went completely bonkers.  Yes it was kinda bonkers and I was just a stupid kid, but their insults after that just made me feel even worse.  They started telling me I looked like a boy.  ""Why are you trying to look like a boy?""  ""If you think you're ugly, why make yourself look worse?""  ""Are you mentally ill?  Is that why you dress that way""  ""Do you know what a dyke is?  Well you look like one."", most of the insults coming from my dad.  He then one day asked me in front of everyone if I was a lesbian.  I said no and he accused me of lying.  I ran to my room crying, only to have mom come in and ask me the same question once more, but in a calmer tone. No, I'm not a lesbian! Stop asking! 

The tip on the icing was when I was sitting on the couch watching tv, my dad came and sat on the other sofa, mom was in living room to btw.  Few seconds later he tells me, ""Do you know the short hair makes you look fat?""  My mom defended me and told him to stop and that he shouldn't say that.  It's funny cuz I had kinda thought I was chubby, as most young girls do, but he pretty much confirmed it for me in my mind.  I ditched the t shirts and wore only sweaters after that to cover myself. He then starts calling me ""sweater girl"". Kinda funny...until he went out of his way to actually BURN one of my sweaters. And everyone laughed. What's also funny is that I'd seen pictures of me at that age and I was thin, never fat. Guess that was just his way of trying to yet again convince me to ""be normal"".

The thing is, I know he loves me very much. But he has issues controlling his anger and has his own insecurities, as well as problems with his own parents, specifically his mother. It makes him say the stupidest things. I just wish he was strong enough to have not had it affect our relationship. Because it's truly what's caused so much pain in my own life that wouldn't be there otherwise, like my social anxiety, my depression, the fact that I've been homeschooled for 4 years since I was 14,  all because I couldn't stand being around people anymore.  Everyday is the same day for me.  Every week is the same for me.  I don't go out.  I have no friends.  I'm am alone.

I know this is long. I just really needed to vent this out somewhere.  I've spoken to my mom about this once or twice before, but she still doesn't get me, or maybe she just doesn't know how to help me.  But any advice or support would truly help me out guys."
icecreamsandals,depression,1620611654.0,Everything I see is “tainted”?,"This is the best way I can describe it. I can’t see a picture from the 70s without thinking about how the people in it are old or dead now. I can’t talk to my parents without wondering when they’ll be gone. There’s also a perfectionism aspect to it. No work is ever good enough to submit, no activity is ever fun enough to enjoy, there’s always something ‘wrong’ with my environment preventing me from enjoying anything or starting anything. It’s like I’m constantly overthinking everything and taking life too seriously. There’s some level of ignorance that is needed for sanity, but my brain is acclimated to seeing right through everything. Yet, I’ve never had major depressive episodes or suicidal thoughts.

I don’t know where I’m going with this but I just wanted to rant. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder, but have been prescribed adderall XR due to inattention from a family physician (though I still have to see a psychiatrist for a formal diagnosis). It helps, especially with productivity but is inconsistent and makes me crash hard after 8 hours. I’m beginning to think my inattention and constant disinterest and tiredness come from depression, but of course I will talk to my doctor. Is what I’ve described similar to others experiences with major depression or dysthymia? Not asking for a diagnosis on myself but simply your personal experiences"
Ok-Illustrator7834,depression,1620501588.0,Is it normal to feel very angry and depressed when normal people justify your suffering and try to make it look better ??,"I've been depressed and suicidal for five years now. And it gets worse day after day to the point that I can no longer cope with my simplest problems, and I prefer to stay in bed all day long . I had a lot of trauma in recent years, but the biggest cause of my depression is my spine problem. But after I thought about what happened these years, I found that the thing that caused me the most psychological suffering was not the pain resulting from my chronic health problem .., but the things that I heard from people in my surroundings. I feel intense anger , followed by a long wave of depression and sometimes nervous breakdowns whenever I hear healthy people try to convince me that I am supposed to be content and accept my catastrophic life as it is. Especially what I usually hear from religious people ... when they try to convince me that there is a good divine plan behind my illness ... when I hear such words that make my suffering an acceptable and positive thing ... I become insane . For example : two years ago when I tried all the treatments and didn't work. I became suicidal ..My mother told my aunt about that .. so she came to visit me and told me that I'm weak ! ..My aunt.. a healthy, successful, rich woman who has not faced any big  problem in her life .. tells me that I am weak because I think about suicide after suffering daily and for years with an untreated disease that destroyed my youth and all my dreams in life .. She did not  suffer a minute, what I suffered for years, but this did't prevents her from calling me weak   ..I can't even describe how I felt in this situation . Last month my doctor told me that I must be thankful for God because there are much worst diseases than my disease ... wtf !!! ... As if I was born to suffer and I should be thankful because this suffering could be worse .. but living as normal people and pain free ..is too much to ask !! !!  My depression gets worse whenever I hear things like this from healthy people who do not even know what they are talking about..Perhaps because I suffer to the point where it is impossible to be convinced that there is an answer or a reason that makes my suffering acceptable or justified...I feel that trying to make it look better is insensitive and inhumane  .Is it normal to feel this ??  Am I too sensitive ?? Or is the problem in the terms that my arabic society uses to console me?"

The_Viv_Element,depression,1620622616.0,Dreams,"So I just had one of those vivid dreams where school was over (i haven't been in school for 7 years) and everyone was leaving with their friends, then I just realized I was waiting for nobody and I just wanted to curl up in a ball and die outside on school property but my dream made me walk from school to home alone and i remember walking that whole way crossing intersections and cars zipping by... 

thinking ""I've got noone, I've got nothing to look forward to, I'm so alone in this crowded world"" it took too long for this dream to end and I didn't even get home. Now I'm awake and super depressed... normally I'm okay with depression and I've gotten used to being alone in my 4 walls for the last 5 years but I think it's starting to take a toll on me & I hate this feeling that nothing is okay. 

For more context, I'm deaf so it's harder to make friends in person, I'm also a high school drop out because I made stupid choices leading to drugs and drama (dont worry I've been sober and drama free for the last 5 years) I used to not know who I was growing up and I was very lost in the world. But I discovered myself recently & and I've never been happier because now I dont feel so empty inside, I feel like a person / human being but that nagging thought of me being alone and not achieving anything with my life is always there and its gotten very debilitating to the point I try not to leave my room unless I absolutely have to. I have too many regrets I'm holding onto and I hate where I ended up in life because of my past actions. 

I guess I'm writing this because I just want to know I'm not alone"

I used to use youtube and video games to help cope too but its all blended into a big grey mass of self loathing and failure.
Most days i hate myself for all this, why was i put here, cause clearly im just a waist of space, a waist of air, a waist of food.
I ask my friends for advice and they always say the same thing, just try, just take a step. Problem is i forgot how to walk.

I don't know where this self hatred started from cause its been around most my life but im really getting tired of it and everything, tired of letting everyone down.

You ever think it would all be bettee if you just disappeared, how happy everyone would be, how you wouldnt have to keep bothing everyone with your same stupid shit?

I didn’t want to go thru Mother’s Day, not because I’m grieving but I don’t see much in my mum.

Had my driver to get me to A&E; the attending doctor asked if I was doing fine. The surgeon who patched it up spoke to me as it goes. Driver called my sister and that’s when everything went downhill. She came down, had to remind me how useless and trashed up I was. Again putting the blame on me, I couldn’t go thru that ordeal again. We had a heated argument that lead to getting a tad physical. She was hitting so much that I had enough and pushed her. Her fall had fractured her ankle. 

As much as she deserves it, I felt bad. Maybe she’s right, I’m just a useless trash. Now I’m back home feeling very dark, like someone is just telling me to do it again. Inner thigh hurts a lot cause the cut was deep and I had cut upon the femoral artery"

It is my last year of studying and I wasted it all over the past 3 months I didn't turn in any university work and it's past deadline, I missed exam which is 50% of the final grade of the only subject that I'm relatively interested in. And I'm just feeling numb, I'm lying to my parents, who are getting really pissed with me, they talk about all other friends kids who study and work and I only worked for a few months over the course.  
I'm running on borrowed time, my parents already are planning to kick me out if I don't get a job and I don't blame them, they forbid me from taking their food to force me to earn some money so I do shit like surveys online and buy pasta.  
I told my mom I want to kill myself a year ago and asked her not to tell anyone, then my parents approached me and made fun of me basically explaining to me that I had no right to be depressed and I had to apologize, basically I had to apologize to them for various things daily pretty much, I feel so powerless, idk I disserve it probably.  
Nothing really interests me at this point, I used to be into biology in secondary school and college but I burned out and swapped to computer science, I started of well, scoring 90% and ending barely getting to the last year which I'm going to fcking fail and I don't give a fck somehow, It feels so fcking over, I have 0 direction in my life and I will live on the streets soon or kill myself, I already tried once but failed, didn't tell anyone.  
I really don't know what can I do, my parents will be so pissed, they will blame me rightfully, and I will have to get a retail job again or something and they will be so disappointed, (I don't want to tell them that, literally started crying right now think about it), we are from 2nd world country and my family moved to a first world county so me and my brother can have better future, I can't live with that.  

Worst part is I don't feel shit, I don't remember last time I was moved or happy and I can't think of anything to do that I wouldn't get burned out of in few months, it's always like this, I get excited about something, and I do fairly well, then something changes, idk, and my performance plumits.  
  
I don't know what to do, In so pathetic, I have 0 interests I wish I could stay in bed forever, I wish I could kill myself without destroying my mom, I'm such a failure, I recognize that and I was always putting in minimal effort just to get along, I actually never did something because I enjoyed it for the sake of it, it was always to be better than others or to get good grades, you don't get grades for social skills, you get them for shutting the fck up and listening ""you are such a nice well behaved kid"" they used to say, now I'm the ""weird adolescent"", they give me weird looks, they feel sorry for be, they think I'm abnormal, they are happy their kids are normal.  
  
My parents pretty much forbid me from getting therapy, with my evasive personality they would probably have to force me to talk to psychiatric.  
I used to have 2 friends, now they cut off contact with me and when I last met them before covid they were looking weird at me, thinking about it is the most upsetting, I would die for them in and instant (ironic since I don't value my life highly).

I lose interest and joy from all of the things that I enjoyed such as music or as simple as memes, sometimes I feel empty and cry without reason. How to overcome that?"
peeingoutofmybutt,depression,1620613513.0,I need this off my chest,"I just broke up with my boyfriend who is suffering from depression but was in denial. I have suffered with depression and BPD for well for as long as I can remember. I broke up with him because I am currently going thru a pretty bad episode and I know he can’t help me and I wanted to resort to my normal vices (cigarettes, alcohol, and sex). I knew I couldn’t with him in the picture. I also feel like I’ve lost myself somewhere in our 5 year relationship. I know I need to talk to someone but I also can’t bring myself to do that. I’m pretty low right now and I know I can’t just kill myself because my brother killed himself about 4 years ago and I know my parents wouldn’t be able to get thru that again but I find myself accepting the idea of death in other ways. Well that’s it I guess."

DudeWheresMyCarFan,depression,1620562839.0,Do others eat one meal per day?,"I’ve been self isolated for so long I basically forgot humans are supposed to eat 3 meals every day. That seems like so much. I don’t think I could   find the money or motivation to prepare 3 separate meals consisting of different food every single day even if I wasn’t depressed. That sounds crazy to me.

I eat one meal usually an hour or two after I wake up and that’s it. I’m not usually even hungry then I just know if I don’t it increases my chance of a mental breakdown that day by like 500%.

Objective_Bench_4605,depression,1620487612.0,"Disillusionment with life, in particular friendships and relationships","I find it hysterical that people will pretend they give a shit about you, but as soon as you get caught in a difficult place the same people are no one to be seen. It seems to me like most people are entirely self serving, they will use you and then as soon as your use is up they will no longer pretend to care. The funny thing to me is that when I do eventually end my life it will be the same people making tonnes of shitty posts on instagram about how upset they are and all the fucking rest. I do not want to give people the satisfaction of going through life pretending they are good people when in fact they are not. I suppose it is part the society we live in. Everyone is self serving. These are not good people but it seems to me like more and more there are hundreds more of them. I find the hypocrisy of it so aggravating. I want to call people out on their shitty behaviour but this will achieve nothing. the only end result of this will be people thinking I am even more fucked in the head than they already do."
iamherebutwhy,depression,1620544302.0,Anyone else just feel tired of being here?,"I am so exhausted of trying to please others and fake being happy. My family is dysfunctional and doesn’t understand depression or anxiety, or any other mental health issues for that matter. My boyfriend has his own that he personally deals with. 

I just feel like I’m hanging on by a thread here. I feel like I’m getting so burnt out that I can’t see anything getting better. 

I would love to not be here anymore, but I’m too much of a coward to do it and honestly, my daughter is the only person I do not want to let down. Regardless if I have a family or a boyfriend or if I’m pregnant. None of this matters. My daughter is the only light that keeps me going. But what happens when even that stops being enough?

I used to self harm and the thought doing it now is very appealing. 

When does it get better? When will the voices shut up? When will the hurt stop? When can I finally rest?"
SayWhatAgainMFPNW,depression,1620606920.0,I am consistently sad. Despite some things to be happy about.,"I don't know where to post this and I legit have no friends or family to speak with. After attempting to take her to Red Lobster we got a flat tire and it made me snap. Currently just wanting to drink enough that I don't wake up. 

The girl I was dating for a few years got pregnant a while back. My son is 10 months. She comes from nothing and I was an addict. We were homeless for a bit after she got hooked too and things got bad. She is stupid. There's no nice way to say it. Either she is stupid or refuses to learn out of laziness. Once I found out she was pregnant I crawled half frozen oit of that tent and got to work. I currently have 13 thousand in my bank account with 4 credit cards and two thousand. In stocks I am saving for my son not to mention the 15 thousand nest egg I made sure she has in her account.. I also manage an apartment complex which helped get us our first legit apartment. 

I feel that my girlfriend is depressed. She doesn't clean.She does nothing to further our progress besides take care of my son while I am work. Which before yall blow a tampon I work in the same complex we live in. I get to spend an hr in the morning and 430pm untill his bedtime and I change diapers,do laundry,work on our car,handle the finances I basically do everything. She asks me to do these things.She weighs almost 350 pounds and orders food constantly and actually gets upset when she cant. Im always asked  To go out. To do this. To buy that. I barely get any time to myself. She says its just as bad for her but she can relax foe hours while he naps and I am there most of rhe time. I think its depression that is holding us back from being what we could be. 

I know this is almost like relationship advice but I am more worried about our mental health. Is it possible her being so horribly depressed and melancholy that it has stressed me out to where now I am depressed?. I dont want to be one of those guys that snaps and beats his gf because he feels she is sucking the life oit of him. Its just so sad. My son even had his lil suspenders on and everything. If anything his is a vent post. Im going to have to put my foot down. She has been in the mental hospital before and is too uneducated to fill out any court paperwork. I feel like I am about 2 seconds from finding someone thats grateful. Hell half these girls would love the double 70 inch 4k tvs x box and a luxurious lifestyle compared to most. They would have no problem taking care of my son especially at this age. Then just maybe then I could come home to a clean house a cooked meal and maybe fucking accomplishing something for herself for once. Im tired of being the ox pulling the cart and its destroying my mental health. Anyone else have someone so toxic it made your mental health worse?"

My concern is probably more with mental health in general. I'm in my early 30s, and for about 12 years, I've suspected that I might have some form of bipolar disorder.

I went to college at a highly religious university, and the few times I've met with a therapist, I feel like they just kinda blew off looking for the real problems. 

I have terrible anxiety and crippling depression, but not all the time for some reason. It comes in waves, followed by an over-the-top happiness phase that can just as quickly snap me into a terrible rage at literally nothing. 

I don't know who to go to or what to do. I'm terrified of seeing a doctor. I have no idea who I should even see. Do I call a therapist or a psychiatrist? How do I know how insurance works? These questions hold me back from ever making a decision, and mental state just keeps getting worse. 

Nothing is wrong in my life. I am in a great place. Not rich, but employed in a position I am happy with. I am surrounded by family who show me way more love than I show them. I don't deserve them. I'm living in literal paradise, yet I hardly ever get outside to see it. I feel like I can't breathe. I can't even get out of bed to play videogames or make a coffee. I pretty much only leave the house to work, or occasionally when my wife drags my ass to do something fun with the family (which leads to a whole new slurry of social anxieties that I never had growing up).

Polarbear1054,depression,1620457550.0,Looking for motivation again,"Jeez I have not been here in awhile I definitely should have revisited sooner. Honestly life didn’t get much better a couple of advances but mostly things are still static. I started a delivery job at my uncle’s restaurant and it’s been paying well, I’ve saved up enough to maintain my car, help with rent, and even buy my own ticket for Morocco.

It sounds great but I’ve also been lying to all of my friends and coworkers that I’m attending school. To the point that I’m making lies about days I can’t work to make it more believable. I sent my application for school way too late and haven’t received a response back. in my parents eyes I wasted a year, because I didn’t go to school right after. I’m now scrambling to try to apply to the community college and get my shit together. And by scrambling i mean keeping it in the back of my mind until I eventually crash and burst out on the wrong person, or actually apply. I can’t even lie to myself and say I’m trying my best.

I went out for ftour (breaking fast for Ramadan) at the restaurant I work at and when we were cleaning up and trying to take our food home I got called fat by my coworker Alex for taking food home. 
“He’s already 300lb why would he want more!?”
Even though I laughed it off and my uncle wanted to yell at him I just cleared the situation so nobody had to feel bad. But truly that shit hurt me, I couldn’t ruin the night and it honestly pushed me to come back here. Almost a safe zone were I actually just let it out. I’m having thoughts of starving myself and as horrible as it seems I’m honestly thinking about it as a viable option. I’m gonna attempt to wake up in the morning to go to the gym and try to work out again after not going for more than a month. 

Shit was simple and god do I miss it, I see my friends who are the same age as me, and coworkers younger then me with a future already started or already laid out for them and I’m just gasping for air trying to catch up. I’ve been playing way to many video games lately and I want to attempt a week break although it will be hard I think it will reset me mentally. Of course this is a lot of motivation and shit talking from an overweight dude at 3am but I have to talk to someone. My parents are too old and don’t have an understanding of where I am and it will only make me feel worse from their textbook response, my sister has her own life there’s no need for me to ruin it with a stupid rant, she has enough on her plate. I need to fucking get it together or my life is worthless. If I don’t get it together then killing myself would be the best option, as extreme as it sound, no weight is better then dead weight."

Clefty96,depression,1620622039.0,Therapy doesn't work for everyone,"""Get therapy""

""You need therapy""

""Have you talked to a therapist about this""

The amount of times I receive responses like this is astronomical, and I've held my peace regarding my thoughts on the world of therapy for FAR too long. I am sick and tired of being told this is the end-all solution to my problems.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety right around the age of six after the passing of my father. Since I wasn't an adult and couldn't really make my own decisions, I was stuck bouncing from ""professional"" to ""professional"" for twelve years. It was always the same thing. They'd try to pry my soul open and prescribe experimental drugs that would work momentarily before fucking me up and leaving me feeling worse off than before or, in some cases, a psychiatric ward. The physical affects were there, too- I was morbidly obese for most of that timeframe. I don't think I really need to go into detail on all the bullying and harassment I got as a result of that alongside my cleft palette- I'm sure we all know just how fucking cruel kids can be.

When I turned 18, I said enough is enough and dropped the medications and the therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists. And you know what? My life is admittedly still a shit show. I have NO friends and NOBODY to talk to. Most people cannot stand me once I actually open up to them, which is harder to do now more than ever on account of being in abusive relationships and periods of having shitty friends. That said, I've honestly done more with myself than I ever did on all of that garbage and people with prestigious degrees poking and prodding my brain all day long. If I hadn't done this, I honestly have no idea how I'd even be able to drive or hold a job because of how much the meds screwed with me. I've also lost a TON of weight since I don't have the heightened appetite that I used to. I was once over 300 pounds...I'm now sitting at a comfortable 161 pounds and plan on being about 140 by the end of the year following some setbacks. In addition, I don't have to worry about the obscenely inflated costs of these ""professionals"" and medication that doesn't even work for me. I'm not exactly rich now, but there's no way in hell I'd be able to survive if I was stuck paying for that crap considering how much of a joke American healthcare is.

I'm not saying this is the path for everyone in a similar situation. I'm glad the shit works for the people who can afford it or actually benefit from it, but I can't say I'm one of those people and I know there are others. Telling me to ""go to therapy"" after wasting a dozen years of my life on it with hardly any (positive) results just sounds like you're telling me to go fuck myself at this point. If it was actually affordable and worked for me, I'd be all for it but that just isn't the case. I just wish people would stop acting like it's going to solve all my problems, or anyone else's for that matter."

skinnyy2021,depression,1620609684.0,"besdies telling people it's ok to not be ok, we should also tell people it's ok to not be normal","For years, I feel like all my life has been me acting, saying lines because that's what the script says. 

you see, it's the little things. we tell people it's ok not to be ok but we don't really tell them it's ok to not be normal. if I told people I spend the holidays alone, they'd either get uncomfortable or find it weird. or worse, feel sorry for me. or they start thinking about what's wrong. never mind that I'm actually at peace with it. so it's easier to just lie.

Whenever I have to fill the in case of emergency contact field, I put my mom's name, though I haven't spoken to my family in years. The number is fake- also mine. While it looks like I have friends, there's no one out there who I'm close enough with. i could ask a casual friend, but it'd just lead to questions. so again, I lie.

Because while I am fine with all of the above, society isn't. I won't say I'm completely ok but I'm at peace.  But this constant subterfuge is draining. i do realize I choose to do this, that I can just not pretend, but it's easier this way. Not because I'm embarrassed of the truth. But because the truth is complicated. 

I know it's a coping mechanism that I never let people get close. I talk to people. i laugh. I can even be charming. but that's it. sometimes, it feels hollow. but at least it doesn't hurt. It'll probably be like this forever. If it is, that's ok. It's better than crippling depression right? At least I'm still functioning. It seems like a pittance and sometimes I feel like I shouldn't settle for this but you know what? At this point, I just want to be ok."

But i do truly hope she’s happier with me gone. all i ever wanted was for her to be happy so at least there’s that. still truly heart broken and shattered. i’m back on back habits i’m smoking cigarettes again. i’m not eating. i’m not sleeping. and i honestly don’t know how to find motivation to keep trying. what am i trying for? i’ve lost everything."

Instead now I am feeling this moment. I am finally home, my parents are asleep for good after a long travel and its 2AM and I am outside in the rain. I am ready.

This weekend we found out my aunt had multiple strokes. Today doctors told us she is brain dead. She is technically still alive, but that is only because of the machines she’s connected to and the medicine they’re giving her. She is the rock in our family. Always there for other people. She is the glue in our family, she always brings us together. She is my dad’s best friend. She has helped him through his darkest times, she is the reason I still have him. She was perfectly healthy, 56 years old. And now she is gone. I don’t have many family members in general that I feel comfortable with. She is really the only family I’ve had, besides my dad and brother. She was the closest thing I felt like I had to a mom, because me and my mom have had a really bad relationship for over a decade. I feel so lost and empty. I don’t know why but I can’t stop feeling like I’m bad luck. I’m just everyone’s bad luck charm. Lately i feel like everyone I love is just suffering. I feel like as soon as I enter a chat, a group, a video game, whatever then toxicity and bad things happen. I’ve been telling my brother every night for weeks that I just don’t understand why bad things gravitate to me. He recognizes it too, how many bad things directly happen to me. Without going into my whole life story, I’ve only had abusive relationships, I’ve had manipulative and toxic friends my whole life, my mom singles me out to yell at and belittle. It just feels like never ending sadness and bad luck whenever I’m around. 

I wanted my aunt to be there for all my accomplishments. If I decide to go to grad school, whenever I get married, whenever I buy a home and raise a family. I wanted her there, because I knew she’d be unconditionally happy and supportive. The only other mother figure I had was my ex’s mom and I can’t talk to her. This feels like the 3rd mom I’ve lost in my life and it just feels like too much."

She_is_poetic,depression,1620494894.0,My boss is making my depression worse,"I’m having a really rough week. I’ve been on a new medication that is supposed to treat my PTSD and depression and there are great days but when things are bad the medication makes it feel like they are worse then they really are.  

Work in particular has been really difficult for a while now. Last year I was in the top 30% of the company but I felt like I was draining every ounce of live energy I had to get there. I was being told how good of a job I was doing in the moment but my boss would bounce back the next quarter and tell me I needed to do better. (Side note we have had a high turn over on our corporate team due to her management style). 

I have always been extremely ambitious and held myself to a high standard. I give my all to the work that I do and don’t believe in half ass-ing things. However, being told that what you do is never good enough really seeps in after a while and the last month or so that has impacted my motivation to do my job. I am still adhering the metrics, just not the “top tier”. She put me on a probation review at work for having 3 weeks of low job performance. This week she told me she has no confidence in my ability to do my job. 

I was in line to move into a different non-metrics based position in the company and she gave me a poor review in the final stage and they opted to select someone else. Mind you this is all based on the last few weeks of performance. 

She has also pushed me to reveal my mental health struggles to her and uses them against me. 

I feel like I am in such a shitty place and I feel so degraded and worthless. I have few friends right now and my support system is iffy.


Long story short: my boss is making work hard and my mental state is causing things to cave in."

I feel like a completely different person, after certain events that have sort of turned my world upside down. I wanted to ask you guys here if this falls within grounds of what depression is? 

I feel like I am completely unable to be an adult again. Moving back out, working regularly. Like, I have to survive and can’t lie in bed or cry as much as I do now. I need to be “on” 5 days a week, 7 hour days of which I am planning on with my new jobs. I am so scared. The thing is, I know I’m in a better place financially now. When I was younger I was so fearless and not so anxious and scared. I managed being on my own then, but now? I don’t know. 

I almost feel lazy for these feelings, but it’s like I overstretch myself and say”I’m going to do this. I need to grow up and take ownership of my life” and on the other I am so overwhelmed with school and working essentially three jobs. 

I think I’m ready to start the medication, but I’m scared. I’m scared I’ll change, or get a lot of side effects. I feel shallow, but im also scared I’ll gain a lot of weight, which I have heard is normal. 

I guess I’m just here to vent, and hear your thoughts or maybe guidance on this. Cause sometimes I don’t even know what I’m feeling or experiencing. I honestly DO want to feel muted. And not so emotional anymore."
htz245,depression,1620452411.0,"please read with an open mind, without any judgement","&#x200B;

October'20,  left the working lifestyle to focus mainly on health since the conditions that I was facing were complicated to balance up with the work-life. I'm still in my early twenties, so when friends or random peeps came to know of it, they would just blindly comment that "" Your parents are well off, you can afford to live without a job, don't need to worry about short in cash"" I hated that comment. 

six months down the road, presently, i am still out of the work life. and i am still surviving. my parents are gone so i have inheritance from them but i don't tap into the funds much. But since mum always reminded me to have a black card for medical, i waited for the invitation to arrive and yeah now i have one for myself. anyways, i have been using it only for medical purposes. eventually people start to notice the card, and the comments returned - why don't you use it for dining or shopping? why restrict yourself? i am not even given the space or writes to say ""oh i am tight on greens"". i used to limit myself on my monthly allowance, its more than sufficient. 

Just that last month and this month, my dark clouds had been really cloudy and bad. i have daily suicidal thoughts, sleepless nights almost everyday, lack of appetite, lack of motivation and mood, constant nightmares. as a result, i had gone back to spending constantly. i do feel bad, but i can't control it. buying stuff doesn't exaclty make me feel happier either. i had been buying a lot of shoes and mostly are impulse purchase, not that i need them. eventually i feel like maybe people are right, i am just a fucking spoilt prick. i can't survive with all these judgements, comments and labels that people make. it is sort of driving me to the edge - to suicide. 

""you don't need to work, you don't have to worry about running short of money, you don't have a family to feed. you can live that life forever"" 

growing up, if it's a bad season for depression, sometimes I would keep myself occupied to the extent of constant spending and impulse purchases. people labelled me off as spoilt, without understanding or offering help. I do have a shrink, and sometimes there are trauma and stuff in life that even having a shrink is not enough, requires the family and those who care about you to push for the better, which I lacked that since my parents didn't exactly care much of that. apart from my allowance, I had two black cards, one from mum and another from dad. Mum would always tell me to only use the card for medical purpose since health is always expensive. whereas dad didn't mind what I spent on - so that sort of fed my impulse purchases to ""ease off the dark clouds""...d what I spent on - so that sort of fed my impulse purchases to ""ease off the dark clouds"".

Do y'all actually feel better about yourselves after throwing such a hateful comment to me, a child?"

I dunno.

CoolExchange4260,depression,1620533208.0,Am I looking for attention?,"I've been hospitalized and have had police come to my house a few times for telling close friends I was suicidal/saying goodbye. I've overdosed to try and kill myself, I still struggle with self-harm here and there. When my partner and I would have huge arguments, it would put me in a headspace where I feel worthless and want to end my life, and I would tell him that. But, I would try to convince myself how much of a bad idea it was to attempt, and wouldn't. Whenever I mention being suicidal (which at this point is only to my partner), I genuinely feel like I want my life to end so that my mental suffering can stop, but I can't bring myself to end it all. I'm not lying when I mention that I have suicidal thoughts, but I never have enough motivation to do it. I was called attention-seeking and that it was unfair that I got to tell him (my partner at the time) that I was suicidal and never actually go through with it. Now I'm overthinking and feel like maybe I am just an attention-seeker or convincing myself I'm more depressed than I actually am. I feel extremely ashamed of my mental health and my past related to it. Can someone tell me what they think?

TL;DR I was told I was attention-seeking because I've told someone I was close to multiple times I wanted to kill myself but haven't done it."

Then I’m unable to work and I have to go on leave. My panic chest pains and head pressure are so bad, which stresses me out even more. I’m unable to clean and take care of myself and I stop caring about my material possessions. 

It’s also hard to explain, but when the nonstop thoughts and panic get to be too much, it feels like I’m not really me and I’m super out of it. Also sometimes I’ll wake up and it feels like the day before was a dream 

Aside from my obsessive all consuming thoughts, I also spend all my time and energy “researching” the meaning of life and what happens after.

Feel like everyone around me is established and stable.  I'm constantly dealing with depression and problems and cant seem to feel okay. Quit kratom after 4 years and considering going back to ems. My last career but I'm so burt out and it destroyed my confidence in everything. I did it for 5 years and it was okay but overworked and underpaid. I should be grateful, because I've done so many jobs that it gives me options, but nothing I want to do. I feel so scared for myself and hate that feeling. Feel I've accomplished nothing and family is really hard on me and constantly telling me I need to pick something and I'm too old for this. 

Really fucks my head up and gives me obsessive thoughts of plans to fix my life, which is exhausting and depressing. I just feel so lost"

When I entered uni, I got into a deep depressive phase. It is a very prestigious UK uni and I don’t see myself leaving because of my academic background (always been a good student, have had good grades at this uni so far) but I really hate it. It got better at the beginning of this year when I changed my degree programme. However, with COVID, my mental health re-spiraled again and I just gave up on living in general. My fear of failure and my permanent state of sadness in the last 3 years just make me want to die. 

The trigger is that I didn’t submit an assignment, which means a fail which means it’s going to be on my transcripts hi how means a much lower classification which means not getting the masters or jobs I want. I know it’s not the end of the world for a lot of people but it is to me. The feeling I feel inside is of complete despair from both the recent trigger but mostly due to 3 years of ongoing sadness.

I have been seeing a therapist before (who all diagnosed me with severe depression), I am seeing one at the moment (it’s been 2/3 weeks with this one). I have also tried medication before with little success.

I think I’m going to kill myself. My question is: What can I do to prevent this? Should I go to a mental hospital? I feel like I have been depressed for too long and this is my last option..."

TW: suicide 

Hello all. I am new to this sub, but not to chronic pain. This past Friday I learned that I lost a dear friend to trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headaches. He held on for as long as he could, but with no sign of relief on the horizon he couldn’t hold on any longer. I recently learned about ketamine infusions and how life changing they can be, I also learned how they are not an option to so many due to costs. While processing my grief on Friday I decided to try to change the world. Which is funny coming from the girl who is terrified of walking into a room of strangers and being the center of attention, now suddenly I have decided I want the whole world to look at me and know mine and other chronic pain patients struggles. I am working on creating a social media campaign to fight back against big pharma and the pain clinics that rake in money hands over fist for a drug that is basically pennies compared to the fees they charge. On the day these pages go live I will need all of the help I can get to share the post to get it trending so it is not just scrolled past. I know like many others I have contemplated suicide to make the pain end and I want to end that. No one should feel that is their only option left. Right now my main goal is to get ketamine infusions indicated as a treatment for chronic pain, PTSD and depression to make it more affordable-but if these takes off other things like diabetes can be added."

SirTalkALot406,unpopularopinion,1620563186.0,Biking sucks as an excercise,"So, I've biked a fair bit as a kid and young adult, and I never enjoyed it, not even a little bit. Since then I always thought I just disliked exercise. You know, average lazy guy who doesn't like cardio.

But I was mistaken. I've always enjoyed swimming a fair bit, but recently I tried jogging, and it's a lot nicer than I thought excercise could be, especially when I managed 5km for the first time, I really just enjoyed myself while making my legs move fast, but not too fast.

So why is it, that I hate biking so much, when I actually like excercise?

For one, it is a long drag and a waste of time. I enjoy hiking, but mainly as a way to have a chat while experiencing nature. You don't get that with biking, you can't talk without being run over. With biking you also do the same repetitive motion over and over again, usually for hours on end, and you get nothing out of it, that a sport which isn't as repetitive and drawn out wouldn't give you.

But oh, while bikers can be annoying, mountain bikers are straight up obnoxious. Everywhere you look on the internet, people tell you it's ""oh so much fun"". Well, guess what, I tried mountain biking a bunch of times, with good gear and a good bike. Let me tell you, it fucking sucks.

You start with going up a hill, which is probably the most painful and depressing form of excercise I've ever tried. No matter which gear, no matter which pace, I'd much rather get off the bike and just walk, because then I could at least enjoy the nature, a chat and not become suicidal over a form of excercise.

Next up is the downhill, which everyone claims to be great and fun and whatnot. But what it essentially is, is going fast while risking your life, being in beautiful nature, but instead of looking at trees, you're focussed on a couple rocks that will almost make you crash.

It sucks, nothing about mountainbiking or regular biking is fun to me, and I'd much rather hike, walk, run, swim or drive, at least that isn't as repetitive a motion, and with driving you can actually go fast without risking your life."

The worst part though is that they all subscribe to this narrative that the world is *afraid* of Bikers.

I know there’s actual biker gangs and more than a few tough bikers still out there, but most of the people spouting this shit are just old dudes who bought an expensive motorcycle. And guess what.

amboyurbex,unpopularopinion,1620497619.0,I think popular photographers on social media are shills for photo/travel companies,"Popular and rising photographers on social media lately have me scratching my head with many questions. I can be a little cynical, but it seems to me that as of late (maybe the past year or so) there's this guerilla marketing campaign going on trying to tap into photographers, wannabe photographers, and wanderlust-ers.

This typically happens on Twitter I've noticed, where these photographers shoot up in popularity, but the same photographers in question do maybe half as well on Instagram - though they tend to gravatate towards Twitter. The general theme is often this travel/wanderlust thing, and they all mostly identify as lonely and air out their problematic past. Theses photographers, when they identify themselves are all extremely young and good looking, and spend an inordinate amount of time on social media, despite their wandering/always shooting lifestyles. Many even cry poverty despite presumably having expensive gear to shoot and edit with, and nice clean clothes and well groomed... their entire existence on social media is shooting, shooting, shooting and seemingly existing in some unattainable reality. Nothing about their jobs or anything like that.

Some I've seen have had legal troubles (like getting caught trespassing and the like) which stirs up the right amount of drama... only for it to drop. Others talk about depression, drug use, and other issues, despite that stuff not affecting their consistent output. All trying to appear relatable to those following.

I have been shooting for 20 years and yes, that kind of life sounds exciting, but photography is expensive (almost prohibitively so) and hard to break out, and that lifestyle is not cheap. I have been published, gone viral, and all those things, but my following never blew up. I know photographers who do the same, and dealt with what I deal with. A couple made deals with photo related companies like Nikon and Sony, and boom, their lifestyle changes a little and their followings shoot up.

I can't put my finger on it and I know I sound like a conspiracy nut, but it's hard for me to look past it now. These photographers are talented, don't get me wrong, but I really can't shake the feeling they aren't representing themselves alone and that they are well funded and equipped as well as assisted. Almost every ""normal"" photographer I know doing the grind says social media is a time suck, editing is a time suck, and shooting in itself can take up time outside of just dealing with life... yet these super-shooters seem to put out content like a team is helping. And that's what makes me scratch my head.

And it's not to say it can't be done at all or that very talented folks don't deserve a big following. Nor do I think all extremely talented, well followed photographers are shills. I don't know. It's just bizarre."

techtonik25,unpopularopinion,1620647749.0,Smore's is an absolute garbage of a dessert.,"Its supposedly the dessert of choice when going camping. You roast your marshmallow over the fire and sandwich it between graham crackers and chocolate. Good idea.

Unfortunately, the experience of eating this god awful thing couldn't be more inconvenient and frustrating. Once assembled, you absolutely need to hold it firmly with both hands because, contrarily to, say, a grilled cheese, the ingredients are not all melted between the crackers so there's no ""glue"" to hold it all together.

There's also the ""hard taco shell"" problem: upon your first bite, the crackers will inevitably shatter, spilling your fillings all over the ground and yourself because honestly, who eats smore's in a plate? This problem costs me about 30% of my smore's every time.

It might just be the fact that my graham crackers are too thick, but holy shit that dessert is so DRY. I have to chug a gallon of water for it to pass. It would certainly help if the chocolate was melted though so it could seep a bit into the crackers, but you would need to burn your marshmallow to a crisp before it had enough heat on its own to melt the chocolate. Even if you do manage to heat everything properly, you only have a few minutes before everything gets cold and even drier.

Finally, this one is 100% subjective but, I simply cannot continue eating smore's after a couple bites. After chewing on almost pure caramelized sugar and sweet milk chocolate a couple times I find myself feeling sick of the sugar.

Not saying that swearing is a good thing, but if you call someone's parents for saying a bad word, then it's just wasting their time, in my opinion.

Simian_DustinP,unpopularopinion,1620507241.0,"Halo Top's ""Stop Shoulding Yourself"" ad campaign is gross and hypersexualizes ice cream"," First, there was the commercial featuring a plus-sized woman jubilantly dancing around in her underwear and bra to Lady Bri's 'Just Watch Me Now.' Secondly, there is a more recent commercial featuring two guys on the beach. For whatever reason, they start dancing (possible because they hear the song in the background, Jax Anderson's 'Good Day' but likely not), because that's what plus-sized guys do at random to celebrate their bodies. The weird part is around :23 seconds in when the guy eating ice cream closes his eyes and tilts his head back with his mouth open... I doubt the ice cream is *that* good. These ad campaigns try to position the ice cream as a more healthy alternative to other ice cream products while also spreading body positivity. Still, this ad campaign misses the point, you don't need to sexualize plus-sized people to accept them and sexualizing ice cream (Any food outside that used for hen parties an' such) is a dumb marketing move.

FiteMeHore,unpopularopinion,1620436438.0,The West Coast is incredibly overrated,"So, I moved to the west coast a few years ago thinking that I was going to find this great place full of open minded people, stunning cities, and a unmatched lifestyle. Instead, over the years I've discovered, that while the nature and weather are great, and the tech economy is healthy, there is not much else here that is ""great"".

1. There are homeless people EVERYWHERE and they litter the streets with trash and fill up the parks with these pseudo tent cities. It makes walking anywhere make you feel like you're walking in a dystopia.

2. The housing situation sucks all around. In the Pacific Northwest, most houses are these dilapidated shanties that are falling apart from wood rot and mold. But because there is limited space to grow, these sh\*tholes sell for 300 to 400 thousand dollars - beyond what most people can afford. In California the houses are nicer...but they go for millions. 

3. If you don't work in tech or medicine or finance, get f\*cked, because you are going to make enough to live on your own here without roommates. And that is if you're lucky enough to get a good job at all- competition is so fierce that unless you have years of experience you're just not going to get call backs.

4. The people are fucking stuck up. Most people who are from here have hardly seen the rest of the country yet they act like they're better than everyone else. They don't give you the time of day, are flaky and non-commital. It's so frustrating.

I went to visit a small city in the rust belt recently. From all the things I've heard from people where I'm from, I had these images in my head I was going to be heading into a disaster of a community. And it turns out my pre-concieved notions were entirely false. In fact, this small city I went to was better than my home back west.

GreenFriday13,unpopularopinion,1620487291.0,Parents should stop calling their children 'geniuses',"I know the title is pretty vague, but let me explain. I've heard quite a few cases on the internet where students in secondary are struggling and falling behind their peers or expectations because their parents and other adults called them 'geniuses' in primary.

The bad thing about calling children a 'genius' is that parents who say that are forcing the idea that these students' talents are far beyond their peers. This is the difference between complementing someone by calling them smart and boosting their ego and making them deluded.

It sounds harsh, but I have every right to say this because ever since I was a child in primary, my mother would call me a 'genius' and say that I'm talented in various subjects. This literally created a very harmful ego and confidence within me which made me think that I was simply born smarter than my classmates.

This made me think that I don't need to study as much as others because I was a 'genius'. Most children with parents that say that always got better grades than their peers in class in primary, which enforced this delusion that they can achieve the same grades with less effort.

Victims of this in the internet said that this belief hindered their academic development in Secondary, where you actually need to pick your shit up and study hard to get good grades. While their friends with worse grades in primary were studying harder and picking up experience in studying and getting more disciplined, they were putting less effort because they thought they were smart enough to be lazier.

This is part of the reason why some of the smarter students in primary and even in early secondary suddenly drop off in their grades and make less progress in comparison to their classmates who simply became smarter and matured more by studying more. Primary grades don't reflect how your child is gonna do like 6 years in the future where grades in GCSES and A level/IB actually matter.

Don't just call them 'geniuses' and make fun of their classmates in primary, encourage them with compliments, but always remind them that their true tests will come in secondary, where they need more than 'talent' and humble them so they will continue to put their best efforts when studying."

Amphibians are experiencing a [rapid decline in populations with mass extinctions of many amphibian species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_in_amphibian_populations).   Quoting that Wikipedia page:

>> The decline in amphibian populations is an ongoing mass extinction of amphibian species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are known as one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity. 

While it's considered trendy to hate on cane toads on reddit and brag about hitting them with golf clubs -- perhaps some day we will appreciate Cane Toads for keeping that entire Animal Kingdom alive in the face of otherwise mass extinctions.

It's kinda nice that there is at least one successful species in that kingdom - and perhaps Cane Toads will diverge into many new species that'll fill the ecological niches to replace the frogs and toads who's survival traits aren't well suited for co-existing in modern society.

And all the concern about ""not native"" may be viewed differently in the light of climate change.  As the climate changes - fragile species (like amphibians) can not continue to survive in their historical homelands where the climate changes out from under them.    They will need to re-locate to somewhere better suited to their survival - which is almost by definition not their native range."

Some of these are different in your opinion, but this is my opinion mixed in with the genral consensus on the shows. When the Arrowverse is goodz it is amazing. When it is bad, it can be disheartening and painful to watch. Give it shot, or if you stopped watching, use this as a guide to help you choose what to watch. People just crap on it because of how bad some of the worser parts are, but overall it is a great Tv Connected Universe and, imo better than any DCEU constructions so far.  But we still have time for them to catch up to 8-10 years of Tv.

Even the bad season have some golden gems."
Melodic_Astronaut938,unpopularopinion,1620585915.0,I hate how everything is either extreme ends when it comes to work,"You either have to work till you literally drop dead to get your boss/time off or people to tell you that you need a break, but when you do take the break, suddenly people go on about how you're lazy af and not doing work properly and stuff.

You think the person having mental health issues like slouching about doing jackshit? No, its fucking boring and it sucks. You think the person working 12 hours a day enjoys all 12 hours so much he rather work than take a break? No, he does it because he has to.

Most of the time, these issues do not affect the lives of the general population. A lot of people also simply do not care about politics and social issues that don't affect them. While someone who cares about a particular issue should learn about it, it should not be expected of everyone. We only live once, and some people don't want to spend their short time on Earth researching and spreading awareness about negative things that they don't care about. I'm sick of being judged for not spending my time researching the sad things going on in the world when most of the people who post about them only post them to virtue signal anyways.

I don't mess around commenting on women's pain during labor anyways, but it's pretty dumb in my opinion to not get an epidural simply because you want a natural birth. No one can tell if your kid came out naturally or if you had an epidural. There's no award, no questions asked about it later in life, only anecdotally.

Integrable03,unpopularopinion,1620497586.0,Ludwig Göransson is overall a better film composer than Hans Zimmer,"I know this opinion will flame quite alot of Hans Zimmer stans, but hear me out.
Firstly, I realize it isnt quite fair to compare an extremely seasoned film composer like Hans with over 100 film credits under his belt to a relatively young (Ludwig is only 36) composer who does not have nearly as many films.

However, the fact that despite Ludwig being so young he has accomplished so much in a short time says alot about his talent (and of course, luck).

Aside from comparing them in non-musicial elements like fame and accolades, Ludwig's melodic, harmonic and rhythmic content is more sophisticated and intricate than that of Zimmer's, who only really shines in his signature bombastic Zimmer beats over traditional ""heroic"" chords (atleast only recently, post-Lion King phase). 

Then again, Ludwig is obviously heavily inspired by Zimmer's abstract approach to his craft therefore it isn't too fair to compare them in this way. Also, Zimmer comes from a pop background without formal education whereas Ludwig thoroughly studied film music as well as jazz, so it is inevitable that Ludwig's music will have more sophistication in terms of music (sound design wise, Hans zimmer is better probably)

To summarize, just the fact that virtually everything Ludwig has touched has been quite phenomenal (even in the early days) says alot: all the way from jingles on Community, to big-budget action films and TV shows like Black Panther, The Mandalorian and Tenet, all of which are absolutely phenomenal and truly push the boundaries of music for media, as Hans once did as well with his signature sound."
mac_128,unpopularopinion,1620541270.0,Poor vs Rich mindset comparisons aren’t insightful at all,"Anyone who has seen stuff from the self-help industry and hustle culture pages would know what I mean. There is constantly this poor vs rich mindset comparison, reducing the factors of one‘s financial situation to an oversimplified factor such as “Rich people invest with their money , poor people buy stuff with their money” “Rich people create value, poor people only consume value” and my favorite, a picture of a rich man’s outfit consisting of $20 plain T-shirts and jeans, and a poor man’s outfit of Supreme Tees, Rolex Watches, Gucci belts, and Yeezys. 
First of all, if you earn so much that your basic necessities can be covered by 1% of your income, any idiot would invest some of it, and 2. If someone can afford a $9000 outfit, it is unlikely that they’re poor. I’ve never seen a poor person dress like that. 

As someone who has been both poor and financially stable while having both rich friends and poor friends, I think most of it is bullshit. Rich people invest because they can, and tend to consume a lot more than poor people. A lot of it comes down to luck. The way these pages put it is just like saying “Lebron James invests millions of dollars each year on training and maintaining his body while regular Joes only spend $70 each month on fitness and Gym memberships, that’s why you aren’t one of the best players in the NBA” 

Can poor people learn a thing or two from the rich? Absolutely, especially if they are really bad with money and lack practical knowledge. However, I never see any practical advice on these pages, it seems like it’s only there to glorify the rich as some sort of wise, disciplined, and hardworking  species as opposed to the dumb, greedy and lazy poor people, and provide empty carb motivation energy that offers nothing to those who want to better their lives."

If you learn and grow and experience LIFE in that relationship—no matter how fleeting or finite it may be—*how* is it exactly a waste of time? Think about it: of the nearly 8 billion people on this planet, you happened to cross paths and share a meaningful connection with *this* particular human being in this particular part of your journey through life.

Maybe not all examples of that kind of seriousness but just unpleasant stuff like that.

Yeah, a part of me could tell that this is an unpopular opinion, and I'm gonna say it anyway.

In my opinion, trying to mess with others and make them feel lesser upon doing so for the sake of your time not being ""Boring"", is selfish and just plain makes yourself unpleasant to be with.

AbandonedBySony,unpopularopinion,1620446469.0,I'm Getting Tired of Photorealistic Video Games,"Don't get me wrong -- it's great that we can achieve photorealism with CGI these days.  It's an achievement that should be celebrated.

But I've started to get bored of it.  In the past few years, I've played Horizon Zero Dawn, Spiderman, God of War, Days Gone...and those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.  These are all amazing games to be sure, but after a while they all start to look the same.

I'm starting to prefer games with heavily stylized art, such as Gravity Rush and Atelier Shallie Plus.  While these games might not have a particularly high pixel count, their aesthetic will always hold up, no matter how far technology advances."

I totally agree with that. I used to love Always Sunny until I watched Curb. Curb made me realize what a crude show Always Sunny was with its chaotic and far-fetched plotlines. Curb is very realistic and believable yet so funny. It doesn't rely on cheap humor where the characters do something wildly extreme and unexpected. The only thing Always Sunny got going for them is how contrasting they appear when compared to other sitcoms. Other than that I don't see how the show is in any way ""funny""."
ShiboShiri,unpopularopinion,1620467985.0,Women are not victims for wanting to date older men,"In recent popular culture I have seen so many statements cursing men who choose to date women who are a lot younger than them but are above the legal age for consent.

People call men predators for wanting to date women who are younger than them and women who choose to date older men are victims and must have been “groomed”. 

Whilst this may be the case for some women, this is not the case for all women. Why is having a toxic relationship with someone your own age better than having a toxic relationship with someone older than you? 

Also it is completely contested by the fact that today’s society completely glorifies and sexualises young women, so why shouldn’t men of any age find that attractive? (I’m still talking about women above the age of consent.)

My question is, as a woman myself, when do women stop being victims? Even when they’re above the legal age requirement we’re still told we’re the unwitting victims waiting for a predator to attack. Why aren’t they allowed to date someone who is a lot older than them without people calling their partner dirty? 

This comes after I’ve seen an article of a girl (19) “exposing” Matthew Perry for flirting with her on a dating app that she initiated. Men aren’t always perverts and women aren’t always victims. 

I just feel like this generation is so confused."

Like ew.

Until I fucking read that she unmatched specifically because she thought he was a catfish and not the real thing, so he sent a video saying ""why did you unmatch, it's me"" or something. Like girl. You have a huge following, you should at least do your due diligence before publicly vilifying other people. The man is a multiple divorce, suffering a career crisis, and battling addiction and all of this is very public so I'd give the guy a break for appearing desperate, but I wouldn't say he's creepy for sending the video especially since the girl in question outright vindicated him. Not everyone meets their super rich and talented spouse on a runway (and don't think that doesn't rattle my bones).

Moodymoomoo94,unpopularopinion,1620591148.0,I think letting your dog poop outside is more gross than letting your dog poop on potty pad inside.,"Let me elaborate. When you take your dog to poop outside in public areas, you don’t know how many other dogs have pooped in the same place. Your dog might be stepping over many different dog’s poop and pee residue. After your dog poop outside, you would still have to pick up the poop (im assuming you’re a decent human being). In the process of picking up pick, I’m sure you will accidentally graze your hands with the bare poop at least once in a while when in process of picking it up and finding trash can to throw it away.

If you have your own backyard and don’t clean up your dog’s poop, that just means he’s stepping all over it every time he’s outside and tracking it inside the house. Also when it rains and he goes outside, imagine all the gross mud and wet poop he tracks inside. 

A lot of people think puppy pads are gross and unsanitary but I think that it’s cleaner provided that your dog is trained to poop 100% on the potty pad. I have a poop scooper and I use that to pick up the poop and I’m always at least 3 feet away from the poop using the poop scooper. My bathroom is right next to his puppy pad so I flush that shit down the toilet right after. He doesn’t have outside when it’s cold and rainy and track mud and old poop inside. I clean it up quite quickly and easily. Flush it down the toilet and throw away puppy pad.

Now don’t get me wrong, I still take my dog out to pee and poop but since he needs to go out every 3-4 hours as a puppy. I just find it so much more gross to take him out that often and he usually tracks bugs, grass and mud inside the house then I have to bathe him more often. 

Basically I take my dog out when it’s not raining as much as I can. If I can’t, he pees and poop on potty pad consistently. If it rains, he’s staying inside. I rather clean up poop from potty pad and flush down toilet than to have him go outside in the rain and be even dirtier. I just don’t get what the hate for potty pad is. They’re so useful and I get grossed out by owners that let their dogs go out in rain to pee and poop and they come inside, don’t get cleaned or wiped down then jump all over the furniture you’re sitting on."

damthatriver18,unpopularopinion,1620512202.0,Cryptocurrency is a shitty idea.,"1. It doesn't even get used as a currency. Its just traded for fiat money in hopes that it will gain value. Its like trading precious metals except without their usefulness. Gold, for example, is used in electronic circuits thus creating a demand through utility. I can't sell crypto to any industry for any use.

  Fiat currency has legally enforced value whereas crypto is out to dispace fiat without backing of its own. I wouldn't except crypto payment for any major purchase. If I sell my house for so many crypto credits I'm taking a huge gamble that speculation is going to keep the value high. I may as well trade in barrels of gasoline because I can at least use it to get me to work should the value tank.

2. It's not environmentally friendly. It uses electricity on the scale of entire European countries, and I highly doubt that it comes entirely from carbon free sources. The green energy problem still isn't solved and crypto is making it worse. If you have evidence that crypto is driving the demand for green electricity, I would like to see it. Most of us are aware of climate change and want to see green energy regardless of the demand for an electricity dependent currency."

My sister and I are four years apart, we have no other siblings, and the entire time we were growing up I feel like we were just homies. Like yeah, at one point mom and dad both worked out of the house, but my sister and I were both raised to be fairly independent. Obviously, I still looked out for her, but it's not like I had to worry about her getting into any trouble because... we never put ourselves in potentially dangerous situations anyway. Our parents taught us how to make easy meals like ramen, canned lasagna, sandwiches, frozen dinners, etc. and we just ate on our own time if our parents weren't home during meal times. I never felt like my relationship with my sister resembled anything parental and neither did she.

If you expect your eldest child to help raise your younger children, you did not do a good job planning your family. That is completely unfair to your eldest, why should they sacrifice their time to develop their own identity to take care of kids they didn't choose to have? I'm not a psychologist but I don't see how expecting to act in an adult role wouldn't affect someone's psyche when they are still a child themselves and still developing. If you choose to be a parent then you need to be prepared to provide adequate attention and care for your children under any and all circumstances. Obviously, certain extreme situations cannot be completely prepared for — like a natural disaster or something — but you should at least be confident that you can step up to the plate and be the role model that your kids will need you to be. You cannot fall back on your eldest child if you slip up. They are still a child, they should not have that kind of responsibility."

Then their DMs became more and more like that of KiK and Snapchat’s as well as regular SMS. Facebook, FB Messenger, and Twitter then added a stories feature to their apps, and now they seem to be adding their own version of TikTok as well to their apps. I think that this will ruin the popularity and use of each app the more they change, and especially to developing apps and apps that have yet to copy features of others. Each app used to be its own thing. Instagram was for permanent photos, Snapchat for daily updates that were quick and gone, Twitter for quick messages, and Facebook for... whatever Facebook is. Also, apps are adding so many features that it’s hard to keep up with them. I went to someone’s Instagram profile, and there were so many tans of photos and videos that I couldn’t tell them apart from each other. It over complicates apps and makes it harder for new ones to be made since all other apps have “everything you want in one app”. I think this will just make social media a blob of the same things over and over, just with different names (TikTok, Reels, Spotlights, etc.)"

My step son is 5, turning 6 in a couple weeks, and I have been in his life since he was just over 2 years old. I am also a cat mom and had a shih tzu that I loved dearly.

Yesterday, I saw a post by a woman who wanted to wish step-mothers a happy mother's day, especially considering the ""heart-breaking"" fact that their step-kids will be leaving to go spend the day with their biological mothers. Why it would be heartbreaking for a child to spend the day with his mother on mother's day is beyond me but, okay, sure. I accept.

Then reading down the comments, OP states that she wasn't ""heartbroken"" last year, because last year she did not even know her step-child. So in less than one year of knowing your step-kid, you're now entitled to call yourself a mother, *and* have the audacity to be upset that the child is only recognizing their *actual* mother on Mother's Day? You do not become a mother after sharing 50/50 custody with the actual mother for less than one year. If the child in less than one year recognizes you as a mom, that's a different story. But it is nothing you are entitled to.

You also do not become a mother by virtue of adopting a pet. I call myself a cat mom, and you can call yourself a dog mom, but to then extend this to wanting recognition on Mother's Day is just completely outrageous. Dogs and cats do not require even a fraction of the time, effort and work a child requires.

Unless you've actually birthed a child or have been a step-parent to a child for many years, you are not a mother. And you are not entitled to be celebrated on Mother's Day."

The allure of a fancy life is getting weaker and weaker for me now."
Worst_Username_Evar,unpopularopinion,1620526452.0,"Twin Peaks (1990) is borderline unwatchable with its overacting, soap-opera-like characters, teenagers in their mid-twenties, cheesy music, and glacial pace.","Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was expecting something more timeless, given the praise this show gets. It’s like a cross between a soap opera and a bad teen movie. 

I know many things from this era didn’t age well if you didn’t experience them when they happened, but I really didn’t think this was one of them. There are a few solid performances and characters, and the premise is intriguing, but Bobby, Leo, Audrey, Nadine, and Sarah Palmer (to name a few) are some of the worst characters/actors I’ve ever seen in something that’s supposed to be amazing.

Edit: James was 33 when this was aired! He’s supposed to be in high school! 33!

Is there any point in continuing to watch or can I just chalk this one up as a loss? So far it is pretty dreadful.

The setting is cool, though.

sandwich124,unpopularopinion,1620608457.0,Liking femboys does not necessarily make you gay,"It's not necessarily gay to like femboys because even tho they are a boy, they look, dress and sometimes act like girls. So if the looks are what people are attracted to, it makes them not necessarily gay because the looks are of a girl.
Also, by that logic of ""it is a boy even tho it looks like a girl so it's gay"" would also not make sense.
Like, if someone likes loli h*ntai even tho in the cannon they have 1 trillion years it's still child pron because they look, act and talk like little kids, no matter which age they are labeled.
So that can also apply to femboys, cuz they look like girls, dress like girls and sometimes act like girls. If it's the fact they're a boy that you're attracted to, then it's not necessarily gay but definitely not straight. But if you know they're a boy and still like them because of the looks then it's straight because the looks are feminine. It may not be the straightest thing ever but it's still straight enough to be considered straight."

In fact I never even paid any special attention towards his voice whatsoever until I saw on the internet, how people go bat shit crazy over his voice. I was totally lost. His voice is very, VERY normal. Not deep, not shrill, just an average person's voice. There are many people out there with truly unique voice. And you can clearly hear it. But in case of Morgan Freeman, I do not hear it at all. Just an adult male speaking, nothing fancy about it."

My mother has friends in Canada that live with intense COVID restrictions  that do not allow them to even attend religious services. They have been in pseudo-lockdown since at least last March (2020). They must also quarantine if they ever leave the country and quarantine when they return. 

Unrelated, but it is important to remember that Canada does not protect many rights we take for granted here in America like freedom of speech. You can be fined or arrested for saying things the Canadian government finds unpalatable. There are many other reasons, but I will let you folks fill in if you'd like."
ToesyToeNails,unpopularopinion,1620632023.0,Mother's Day is a consumerist holiday preying on sentiment,"This rings true for Father's Day too. You don't need a calander to tell you when to reserve a day for somebody. The majority of gifts are the same copy and pasted things such as cards, mugs, shirts, chocolate etc. There's no thought behind these, it's bought because the gifts buy into the overall theme of ""mother's fay"" or ""father's day"" or even ""St Patricks day"". I live in the UK and for whatever reason, we have our mothers day in March. If it's such an important day, why is it not celebrated at the same time all over the world? 

You can appreciate your parents on any given day or multiple times a year. You don't need a calander to reserve a special day for you. It makes it disingenuous because if it wasn't mothers or fathers day, they'd be getting none of that attention. It's not coming from you as an individual, it's coming from a holiday that's soul purpose is to capitalise on a made up holiday to sell otherwise unneeded merch.

divertss,unpopularopinion,1620533687.0,"If you own your house and have a yard, there’s no reason not to grow at least some perennial food plants.","Perennials don’t really require much maintenance. No tilling, no planting, no watering (unless you plant non local native species). With a yard of grass you sacrifice time every week just to maintain it. Sacrifice money in gas for lawn mower and maintenance on the mower. Just to uphold some thought-up standard of landscaping beauty. You might as well utilize your space to reduce grocery store bills. Maybe your whole yard doesn’t have to be that way, but why would you not have any of your yard be that way? Perennial food forests are very efficient and a couple showed this by growing 7,000lbs of food on 1/10th of an acre in a year. I’m not anti grass. Having an open view, a place to run and play is amazing. But to not have any food on your land at all is insane to me. As we’ve seen during the pandemic our supply chains are fragile. We saw toilet paper and other essentials disappear and people lose their minds. The thought of a food shortage in a first world country is unfathomable, but this pandemic should’ve awakened people to see that if you can’t produce it on your own, you’re not guaranteed to get it. Your food comes from so far away and must go through a number of points along the supply chain before it reaches the grocery store and then ultimately your house. Any one of those points from farm field to your house, has the potential to be disrupted. Again, not growing at least some food blows my mind. When I get a house, I will definitely have grass. But I will also strive to grow fruits and veggies that I could eat throughout the year. Self sufficiency has always been important to me, I think it should be important to everyone."

Bodily functions like that are kind of gross and are usually kind of gross to discuss just casually like that. I mean, take for example pooping. You wouldn't just go on about how you took the biggest dump ever. Nobody wants to hear that because it's kind of gross. Likewise, it's the same thing with periods. There's nothing misogynistic about it it's just something kind of gross that people don't want to hear about, particularly when they're eating. And while we are on the subject free bleeding is gross and unsanitary. There's nothing misogynistic about saying that. Much like veinous blood, saliva, poop, piss, sweat and cum period blood is a bodily fluid which means it carries a lot of bacteria and is not sanitary. Not to mention it carries some actual blood inside of it which means that if a person comes into contact with that that they could be exposed to a lot of blood-borne diseases including hepatitis and HIV.

MundaneResurrection,unpopularopinion,1620451933.0,Being smart is not a curse and is better than being average or dumb.,"I'm tired of smart people complaining about being smart because being smart is a net advantage in life. I wish I was smart because then I would've had a realistic chance of retiring in my 20's. Most lucrative occupations are basically reserved for smart people because companies want people who can learn new things as quickly as possible. Time is money after all. Most people are doomed to spend the rest of their lives slogging away as cashiers ditch diggers or some shit like that because they lack the ability to do something that pays significantly more. Although there are obvious exceptions (for example trust fund babies and attractive people) lackluster intelligence is the true barrier to social mobility in first world countries.

Being smart isn't just an advantage in school and work. Although there are plenty of unhappy smart people they aren't the norm because there's a modest correlation between intelligence and happiness.  Correlation doesn't equal causation. However higher intelligence (all else equal) makes it significantly easier to have a higher income and that financial security makes people happier.

TL;DR: I'm in my late 20's and don't want to wait until I'm old to do so but I fear that I can't because I'm not smart enough to work in a high-paying occupation - hence my contempt for people who insist that being smart is a curse."

I don’t hate this out of jealousy. It feels like a huge breach in privacy on the guy who confessed’s part. One instance that particularly bothers me is when a close guy friend of mine moved away, he secretly told this girl in our friend group that he had feelings. Might as well get it out now and all. While he was away, my friend group went to a birthday party (pre Covid of course) and the gal basically told everyone that my friend told her he had a crush on her. That party had more than 30 people (big friend group) It wasn’t even in topic. I was somewhat angry at this, as she revealed something personal. Whenever I get love confessions that I turn down, I don’t tell anyone. It’s not anyone else’s business. Hell, it isn’t even MY business. It doesn’t have to be this whole thing, but the gals in my life constantly broadcast that shit like TMZ. Another instance that comes to mind is when I texted another female friend who was out of state in the East for college and I wanted to check in with her. The exchange started with me asking how she was. Her answer was—and I quote—“good, just found out like 7 people are in love with me lol”.

QUILTED_NORTHERN_TP,unpopularopinion,1620588284.0,All health regulations are pseudoscience,"Examples of health regulations are occupational licensing of doctors and FDA regulation of drugs. The premise of these institutions is that they “protect the public health.”

Science place is the burden of proof on the positive claim. There is no evidence that health regulations have a positive impact on anyone’s health, no evidence that government decisions are more likely lead to better health outcomes than individuals are able to achieve on their own if left to their own devices.

Do not hark back to “thalidomide;” science says that one example does not prove the rule.

Therefore, the very premise of health regulation is pseudoscience. The FDA is the very thing its proponents claim that it protects us from.

EDIT: the primary counter argument is to give a concrete examples of a particular thing a health agency may mandate, like washing your hands before returning to work. It shows an inability to grasp the concept of regulation and differentiate it from the particular things the government mandates. Government did not invent hand washing, and humanity would not lose the knowledge of it just because the government stopped mandating it. There is no evidence nor reason to believe that government mandates make people any more likely to follow good health practices."

The whole movie a kind of adolescent, comic-book imagining of Blade Runner.

what i’m talking about is how people intentionally go out of their way to kill bugs who are just minding their own business in the grass. like people will be walking on the sidewalk and just see a spider in the grass and step on it. what is the point of that? all you’re doing is just killing something for the sake of killing it. i don’t understand how that isn’t more of a red flag.

A personal example, i was in 5th grade and these kids i were friends with saw a bee further into the playground, and we were playing some game with a basketball i forgot the name of. Well the other boys in my friend group thought they would go over there and throw a basketball at the bee to kill it, despite the fact it was minding it’s own business.

Maxwell_Jeeves,unpopularopinion,1620609214.0,Outlawing Combustion Engines is not good for most people,"To start, protecting the environment is a worthwhile endeavor! However, Reddit is full of people making poverty wages supporting the switch to electric vehicles they will never be able to afford. Anyone suggesting the switch is premature gets downvoted into oblivion. The government doesn't care about you, and is not going to subsidize an EV in any meaningful way to make it an affordable alternative to combustion engine vehicles. A $5,000 used vehicle is a stretch to afford for a significant part of the population, and many have to take loans just to afford it. 

Here are the issues as I see them: 

Many folks live in areas where hookups for EV's are not practical, and electricity is expensive. Infrastructure is getting better, but its still not enough. 

Switching to EV's from combustion engines will make fuel more expensive as demand goes down. Exacerbating the problem of being able to afford a vehicle. 

You found an old used EV to purchase? Congrats, the battery is almost going to be useless if it has any significant use and age. They degrade over time. 

There are many major Cities in the US that do not have great public transportation options, and they are non existent in smaller communities.

Ultimately this switch will contribute further to the wealth inequality we are seeing in the US."
JuneBlues92,unpopularopinion,1620644983.0,Unless you love these people - don’t stick at a job if you “put your 2 weeks in” unless you really want or need to.,"Unless you work for genuinely good people whom you want to remain close to, or want a glowing reference, there is no reason you stick 2 more weeks in a place you hate IF you already have another job lined up. 

Especially if you don’t have PTO. But this is even true if you do. They won’t give you unused time, not in the times we’re living in anymore. 

You should be entitled to the PTO you worked for. There is no incentive for staying a 2 weeks notice if you don’t get that.

There is no sense in giving loyalty to a company you’re leaving. They will show you no decency. And I’m sorry, a glowing reference isn’t even a guarantee in this scenario anymore, actually. 

I’m not gonna say all places do this, but it’s becoming commonplace to not give employees unused PTO time.  I remember back in 2016, I hated my job as an office coordinator so I put in a months notice (since I was a supervisor) and I got my unused vacation pay. However, my aunt was my boss, so I’m not sure if that had anything to do with it."

MeatloafAndWaffles,unpopularopinion,1620519526.0,I rooting for all the people walking out of their low paying retail/restaurant jobs,"Not sure how popular this is so sorry if it is popular. 

Every picture I see of a window with a sign that says something along the lines of “Closed: No workers.” “Closed: Employers refuse to pay more” “Closed: No one wants to work” brings a smile to my face. 

As someone who used to work in retail for minimum wage: right on! 

“But OP, these people are living off the gubbament teets” 

Man I don’t care. If these corporations refuse to pay workers more than Unemployment then that’s their problem. This “Labor Shortage” is one of many problems that could be solved by “throwing money at it”. 

Oh and sure they could replace the workers with “robots” and machines, but good luck dealing with customers who barely know how to turn on a computer.

EDIT: Going to address some common arguments.

“But OP, what about the small businesses? They’re suffering too? Do you not care for the little man?” 

Well, I never implied that small businesses should suffer. However, I’ll say this. If you’re planning on opening a business of your own you need to figure a more-than-minimum wage salary into your budget if you plan on hiring employees. If it’s impossible for you to make a profit based on that model, then you can go back to the drawing board or scrap the idea. You don’t have to pay your employees millions of dollars. But min wage won’t cut it. But hey, at the end of the day, do what you want. Not like I can make the rules. Pay your workers min wage, just have fun with the high turnover and low moral that comes with the territory. 

“Have fun paying $50 for a Whopper Jr.” 

Prices have been climbing for a while now my G, and yet most of the workers are still being paid the same amount of money. I’ve been alive long enough to remember McDonalds having a Dollar Menu, Wendy’s having a Dollar Menu, and Taco Bell selling items for as cheap as $0.79 (USD), and Subway selling questionably measured footlong subs for $5. Guess what? All that is gone now. Plus if I have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a Big Mac, then I just simply won’t eat at those establishments. Hell, I work a decent paying job and going out for lunch anywhere that isn’t a fast food burger joint runs about an average of $12-$15, especially if you want to stay on the “healthier” side. 

“Min. wage jobs are meant to be stepping stones. People need to get educated and find better paying jobs” 

Oh how I love this argument. You’re right, people can get educated and find better jobs. But wait a minute, school costs money. Which means people have to work for that money, especially if they didn’t get a scholarship. Oh that’s easy, they can work a decent paying job for tuition money, right? Oh but wait a decent paying job requires a degree, and the only jobs that are hiring “uneducated” workers are min wage jobs. No problem, I’ll just work at Taco Bell to pay my tuition. Oh but after doing the math I barely get paid enough to buy my books. After all, they won’t even schedule me to work 40 hours in a week because then they’d have to give me benefits. Which means I’ll have to take out a loan. Okay cool, I got student loans to help with tuition, I’ll just get a good job when I graduate. Well the day is finally here and I’m graduating college. It’s a great occasion, and yet I’m worried because Sally Mae Great Lakes is around the corner waiting on their money. No problem! I got my degree and I’m ready to work in a “skilled” workforce, can’t wait to quit my shitty job at Taco Bell where I only accumulated $2 
in raises over 4 years of working there. Oh but wait, the entry level jobs in my field require 5 years experience. And the one job that will hire inexperienced people is only paying $3 above the current minimum wage. Well now I’m in a pickle, I got a degree, I have to start paying off my loans in 6 months. I can either stay at Taco Bell or work in the field I studied in for a laughable amount of money. Yeah sure, I’ll eventually get promoted and make more money, but who knows when that will happen? 5 years from now. I need money now."

TurntPikachu,unpopularopinion,1620516314.0,Saying you’re not entitled to a relationship is a shitty mindset to have,"When people get hurt from being ghosted or led on, I’ve noticed a lot of people use the phrase, “Well you’re not entitled to a relationship with that person so get over it.” While that may be true, whatever happened to the belief that one should “Treat others the way you would like to be treated?” Chances are that the person ghosting or leading another person along wouldn’t like it either if the roles were swapped. We’re quick to tell someone they’re not entitled to a relationship, but slow to acknowledge that leading a person along as well as ghosting lack human decency to one another. 

We’re in a society where divorce, infidelity, and the general abandonment of monogamous relationships as a whole is high. Doesn’t this show that the way we communicate to one another is problematic and should be changed? People continue to dehumanize each other through their actions and validate them by saying no one is entitled to anything. The person who cares the least often “wins” because they end up not being hurt. If you’re haphazardly entering a relationship just to cut things off in such a dehumanizing way, whats the point of even attempting? Its causing a ripple effect that creates a more callous population who lack communication skills when conveying emotion because the person on the receiving end will make sure not to put their best foot forward in future relationship efforts again. 

I genuinely believe that if you want to develop a lasting relationship, you should treat them with the same dignity that you would like to be treated with. Sure you may not be entitled to a relationship with anyone, but you should be entitled to decent human courtesy when pursuing one as well as when ending one.

Edit: This is for ghosting/leading people one. This isn’t saying that anyones entitled to sex. Its perfectly fine to end a relationship, just dont be shitty about it and think about how you would feel if the shoe was on the other foot"

BurntEnds1969,unpopularopinion,1620549650.0,Just in time for Mother’s Day: If someone had a parent/parents that caused them to have issues later on in life they don’t owe them a “Happy Parent Day” acknowledgment.,"This isn’t directed to the parents that are actually good to their children and support them, though many parents that think they are fit this post. You aren’t owed for keeping your kids alive until a certain age, it was your choice to have them and if you made the mistake of having them at the wrong time or with the wrong person you aren’t automatically a good parent for not putting your kids in an orphanage or not getting an abortion. Being a parent isn’t just about being there for your kids financially either, if your child grows into an adult with mental health issues because of how they were raised then you, the parent, fucked up and you should probably take some responsibility for it. This logic contradicts most low quality parent’s opinions but facts are facts, when parents pull this garbage their children have a harder time adjusting to later life and it’s not just bad for the grown child it’s also bad for society, if you raised a child that became homeless because of your shortcomings they don’t owe you anything on parent day, suck it up and deal with your choices."

jbarrio5,unpopularopinion,1620488222.0,Insurance companies need personal injury attornies to exist.,"You see the billboards and tv ads everywhere, such and such law firm got me $500K for my accident, call them now. You would think that insurance companies with all their might and lobbying power would have had laws changed by now in their favor, but no, they are sued all the time.

So why is this? Why do they tolerate these attorneys? The explanation is simple. Insurance companies make a fixed percentage of profit from the sale of an insurance policy. So if you have auto insurance and pay $1200 a year, and they make let's say 10%, that's $120 profit.

Insurance companies raise premiums based on risk and payouts from claims (like when they get sued by an injury attorney). If claims and payouts dropped dramatically (like from [Tort Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_reform), google it) insurance premiums would drop dramatically, and in turn, so would their profits. Try making 10% of a $500 a year car insurance, that's only $50.

Insurance companies do not lose money when they are sued, they just pass on the buck to the consumers by raising their premiums, and thus increasing their profits.

So next time you see a billboard saying that an attorney got me $1 million for my car accident, think that somewhere in some insurance company they are opening another bottle of Crystal in celebration of their recent loss."

But the way I see it, the odds of another civilization being as advanced in warfare as earth is, and being advanced enough to find us is near impossible.

DariusIV,unpopularopinion,1620526992.0,Most doctors aren't that well educated with regard to health.,"Heres a real unpopular opinion, but most Doctors are general practitioners and GPs tend to ossify after medical school and only learn new shit from the pamphlets that pharmaceutical reps hand them to pitch new medications. Their medical knowledge is therefore 10, 20 or even several decades out of date half the time. The number of times I've heard about doctors giving advice that is generally unhelpful or woefully out of date is absurd.

Only Doctors in specialty fields or surgeons bother to keep up with the latest advancements in science, because it is their job. General practitioners just hand out pills and refer to specialists when that fails. The sad truth is that they aren't all that more knowledgeable than the average nurse with 2 years schooling or the sufficiently motivated general public on any particular issue. Even the medical field is acknowledging this, the ratio of nurses to doctors continues to more and more favor nurses.

The only helpful thing most General practitioners can do for you is order blood work, beyond that they are basically gate keepers to keep hypochondriacs from wasting specialists time. Thats a useful role for sure and preventive screen is very important, but you shouldn't treat medical advice as the word of god just because it came from your GP's mouth."

First things first, I recognize the objective talent of Kirk and James, along with Cliff and Jason. They are all great musicians and are obviously good at what they do.

I have 2 main issues:

1) Every Metallica record pre-black album sounds utterly horrible. All the guitars sound so thin and wimpy, Jame’s singing is borderline unlistenable and usually cringeworthy. I don’t think I need to mention AJFA and St. Anger. The problems in production are pretty self-evident.

2) The riffs are pretty same-y and uninspired, in my opinion. Of course theres gems and they do have some of my all time favorite riffs, but it’s like theres no in between. Their riffs are either legendary or just plain boring. 

I will not sit here and say “uGh mEtAlLicA sUcKs!!” because they obviously do not suck, otherwise they wouldn’t be so popular. Guess their less-accessible stuff just isn’t for me. I’ve tried to get into their whole discography but couldn’t do it."

There are people who are living in the prime of their life in their 60s! 

The whole idea of life being too short is young people scared of being old and they think being 30 is too late for them to have fun anymore. All the famous people online I loved as a teen are 40 now (AVGN and sWooZie to name a few). Some are dead or dying but really think about it. Living to the average of 75-80 is great for most people. We just stress out too much about the age that we think we're wasting every year away and life seems too short. Well, life does seem short if you're 21, you've only lived 2 decades, you got maybe 50 more decades left at the least. It sounds short but really think of what has happened in the past 10 years. It has been a long time, and the one man who taught me that was my 94-year-old WW2 vet grandfather before he passed away in his sleep. 94!

We sometimes do terrible things that end up hurting the people we love. It's part of life, how someone deals with the consequences is what matters. Reflecting and making sure to never do it again is what matters the most. 

Yes, she cheated on Aidan, but so have other good people. I mean Steve cheated on Miranda, Samantha slept with another man in front of Smith's face, and these are the most loved characters on Sex and the City. So does that make her a terrible person, undeserving of redemption? Besides she got her punishment with Berger. 

We can't always be a good, loving, and perfect friend. I mean can you honestly say you've always been a good friend to all of the friends that you had? I don't think so. So, yes she can sometimes make things about her and get carried (LOL) away, but hey she always tried to be there for her friends when it mattered the most. And if she didn't, her friends weren't afraid to check her and put her in her place.

roguespectre67,unpopularopinion,1620537656.0,Cryptocurrency is a scam and nobody can convince me otherwise,"Let's examine the premise behind cryptocurrency, shall we? I'm not an expert by any means but I like to think I do my research about things of which I hold strong opinions. Let's use Bitcoin as an example, though it is by no means an outlier. Using a computer program, you direct your computer to run lots and lots of calculations in order to contribute, alongside other people, to the solving of what is essentially a giant math problem, and periodically you and the rest of your compatriots will gain access to a certain amount of Bitcoin, the quantity and/or frequency of which goes down over time as the math problem gets harder and harder to solve. Because decentralized records are kept of how much ""work"" went into the ""mining"" of a given amount of Bitcoin and how often that amount changes hands, transactions are nigh-on impossible to fake and, in theory, are not in any way linked directly to any person in particular, making it a very secure method of payment. Sounds great, right?

However, the biggest argument in favor of cryptocurrency is its supposed inherent value that is derived from the amount of ""work"" (i.e., time and/or energy needed by the algorithm) that is required to generate it, a figure which, as mentioned, is verifiable and nearly impossible to fake. This is opposed to what is known as ""fiat money"", or money that is backed not by gold or another commodity, but by the word of whatever state minted it that their currency has, and will continue to hold, value, and can be exchanged for goods and services. After all, what is God to a nonbeliever?

This doesn't seem like a difficult concept to grasp, were it not for the simple fact that when you boil it down, *every* cryptocurrency is traded using a ""real"" currency as an intermediary. Tesla accepts Bitcoin as payment for their vehicles. How much? However much Bitcoin currently equals the dollar value of the car you're trying to buy, which is a variable figure. Bitcoin used to be super cheap when it first began. Why? Because it could be mined on cheap hardware using so little power that its impact on your power bill was negligible. Now, there are *huge* GPU farms drawing enormous amounts of power devoted solely to mining Bitcoin, because it's gotten so hard to generate more of that you need to spend obscene amounts of money to get any of it, either by buying it directly off the market, or by investing in the infrastructure needed to generate it.

And this brings me to the crux of my argument-cryptocurrency is, fundamentally, nothing more than an extremely volatile stock ticker that people use to separate stooges from their money. Outside of the black market and a couple random meme-loving businesses like Tesla that use their acceptance of Bitcoin or another CC as a marketing point because they're desperate to maintain relevance, it can't be exchanged for goods or services anywhere, any more than shares of Gamestop can be used to order things from Amazon or barrels of oil can be used to buy groceries. Exactly like a stock ticker, someone is always-*always*-left holding the bag eventually. Because of that, they are essentially worthless, and anyone who tells you differently is probably trying to sell you theirs."

I was watching a video recently where he become became red in the face, screaming as loud as he could to someone that they were worthless and an embarrassment to everyone because they were too slow prepping a salad. Same treatment to a man who asked him to stop insulting him. 

Chefs do not act this way. Line cooks do not act this way. I’ve been around them. They do get passionate, yes, and they do debate - but this is not stuff that normal human beings do. Any job in literally any other field would immediately fire you for his behavior.

Another one was a case where a woman on the verge of tears begged him for reduced hours after a 17 hour shift and he just accused her of “making a scene” and trying to be a badass and just gaslit the hell out of her. 

The constant excuses of “well he’s worked hard!” And “he’s dealt with assholes” are so pathetic man. We all have. Why does he have a free pass to be one of the most hateful and unempathetic people in media today?"
Gravedigger250,unpopularopinion,1620630176.0,You don't have depression.,"I see tons of people who are sad for an hour and are all ""I am deprsessed!"" ""Give me some space!"" and then go on to post a happy, motivational pic on instagram and live their lives to the fullest only being sad for an hour a day.   
That is not depression.   
I'd even go to say as far as depression isn't real. I was diagnosed with it, and basically it was like... ""Okay?"" Yeah maybe I tried to kill myself a few times but it's fine, who cares

Point is, wayyyy too many people think they have depression, even here, every second person you ask is depressed. I just don't buy it. Being sad for one day isn't depression. Being sad for a week and living happily without any worries for the rest of the month isn't depression.

There are plenty of people who just don’t have a good time and this way of thinking can make them feel really down about it and like they are the odd one out. Who you end up living with is chance and you may be living with people who you just don’t get on with or gel with.

Also in terms of social life there is an unbelievable emphasis on drinking (at least in the UK), drinking games, going out clubbing. There is real peer pressure to drink beyond your limits and this is so harmful. When people go to uni they are often very young 18/19 years, they want to fit in and make friends and can be easily influenced to go beyond their limits.

All this can really unsettle people and there is a huge problem with loneliness and mental health issues among students, which is also likely due to exam stress etc.. also many people who would likely do much better going straight into work/other training feel they have to go to uni ‘for the experience’

For me uni was ok but far from the best years of my life and plenty people I know had a rubbish time. We need to start setting realistic expectations about it."

FushaBlue,unpopularopinion,1620576173.0,People only dislike things because they don't understand them,"Obviously not the case with things that are blatantly horrible, cruel, and hateful.

I've been trying to open my mind to new things, new hobbies, new interests, and new ideas of the world. What I've found is the things I hated most where the ones that I knew nothing about.

As a light example, I've 'hated' skateboarding and skateboarders. Not for any real reason, but in my mind I vilified skateboarding because it was something I never learned to do. In my mind I classified all skateboarders as different from me, the enemy. Now that I've actually tried it and am learning how to skateboard, I've realized that there was no reason for me to dislike it at all. I hated it because I didn't understand it. I hated it because I couldn't accept myself as being 'bad' at something new. 

People have the tendency to hate things that make them feel stupid. That's the worst things about humans, we're so afraid to even consider that we don't understand things or that we're not good at doing something. We've become so egotistical by believing we know everything that we shut down and decide to stop learning anything new. 

I've been spending my entire life trying to become an 'adult'. The more time I spend learning and observing the more I have noticed adults have very little to no behavioral distinctions from children. Children have intellectual curiosity, asking questions and thinking of different answers. Adults prefer to think they know. Adults pretend to understand. Instead of becoming an adult, I decide to be a child who never stops growing and learning, despite age.

We're so afraid to ask questions that might make us look dumb to others that we learn to stop asking questions. We learn to stop questioning our beliefs. We learn to stop questioning who we are, and that often leads us to a state of discontent for ourselves and who we are. If we all just opened up a little bit, thought positively, and tried to understand new ideas I know there's no limit to what we could do.

We hate the things we don't understand, love the things we understand, and punish others for not understanding the things we understand without trying to help them understand."
LetsCrashThisParadeX,unpopularopinion,1620648779.0,The Saw Movies Aren't That Violent (Especially the first couple) and Are Actually Very Cleverly Written and Well Crafted!,"Hey-yo, are you a fan of the Saw films? I feel like they're looked down upon for being dumb or too violent but personally I think that they're really underrated. The first couple aren't THAT violent either and focus way more on the mystery element and play out more like a thriller than a horror, and the further sequels get super wrapped up in plot - Yes the traps become the centrepieces but I don't think the films overall get enough credit for everything else that's going on around them. They're mostly really well crafted investigative type movies that somehow keep surprising you freakin' 7 sequels in! Clearly I wasn't the only one that enjoyed them judging off the crazy amounts of money they made throughout the 2000s but even still I believe they're hugely underrated. Now, I'm not saying you can't pick them apart in certain ways and they're definitely a bit silly and trashy too - but I think they're well written enough to justify their existence and I enjoy every single one of them. The original is the best, saw is the worst and all the others are... Pretty great. 

Anyone else have favourites? Or do you just hate them all? (And if so why? Because there's two sides to that I think: there's the people who think they're too violent and don't know much about them. And there's the people who look down upon them as being stupid and convoluted, which in some ways is fair criticism I won't lie hahaha)

jxcartier,unpopularopinion,1620490265.0,It's not smart to ask for a higher salary just based on length of employment,"There are lots of people who are underpaid, and I think you don't need to tolerate that. However, if you are paid fairly, at more or less average market value, it does not make sense to request a higher salary just because you have been with the company for a long time. Faithfulness to a company is certainly appreciated by any employer, but that alone is not making the company as a whole more profitable. Your pitch for a new salary needs to be based on your own performance and how well you are making a difference for the financial viability of the company.  This opinion needs to be agreed to by the one giving you the salary. If you give the employer an ultimatum and they are forced to give it to you to keep you there, you're putting yourself into hot water that you don't need to be in.

In fact, if your manager is treating you unfairly, and making it impossible for you to contribute any more than you do, you should not ask for a higher salary even then. It's unrelated. The better thing is to get out so that you can give that higher contribution to your next employer's bottom line. At that point, a higher salary is an organic outcome, and one that nobody has to question."

PsychoBalloons,unpopularopinion,1620525815.0,Video Games Themselves Can Cause Aggressive Behavior Amongst Individual Players,"I believe that video games can lead to violent behavior; however, I do not believe VIOLENT video games lead to violent behavior, but rather NINTENDO games cause violence.

Think about it - you always see violent games in the news being blamed for shootings and what not and how there are countless studies proving there is no link between violent games and actual violent tendencies, but no one ever takes a look at Nintendo games and wonders if they are the ones responsible for violent behavior.

&#x200B;

Take for example internet user putz12.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwi0HVNr7AM) is a link to just ONE video of him raging over Splatoon 2 - a game where there is pretty much no violent content whatsoever. This ONE video is over half an hour and he is screaming curses and threats the whole time and there are HOURS of him doing this over the same game. Additionally,  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48_OPuf10kc) is the SIXTH video in a series about speedrunners for Super Mario Sunshine just getting angry from menial stuff. These are just some examples of how violent some people who play Nintendo games can be.

&#x200B;

Lastly, though not explicitly violent, we cannot rule out the recent allegations brought up in the Smash community regarding sexual assault. I believe that over 100 players in the Smash community were called out for sexual assault([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/hjfv0y/summary_of_sexual_and_nonsexual_allegations/)). For other esports, you may have teams where everyone playing is on their own team and are around the same age so you don't have much to worry about, but for Smash brothers, a game largely played in 1v1 format, there is a big age difference amongst players. There are a lot of younger players who just started playing Smash Bros when it released on Switch and there are alot of players who have been playing since Melee and they are usually both present at Smash tournaments. This could be one of the reasons Nintendo does not support tournaments other than their own- they don't want 30+ year old adults mingling with their younger demographic simply because they are worried about how they will interact with each other.

HopnDude,unpopularopinion,1620499727.0,"As someone who grooms their lawn, I'd have to say 2"" makes more of a difference than you know.","19"" to 21"" with a push mower, is a larger difference than people will lead you to believe.

I've had repeated issues with my first gen style electric mower with a 19"" deck. I kept fixing the battery packs but got tired of doing it every year fixing one of the two and fixing the other the next year. The battery didn't deliver enough to give the electric mower much torque plus the motor style not really meant for a thick full lawn.

So I splurged this year and got a Ryobi mower that uses two batteries and can switch between them, plus a rapid charger, all with a 21"" deck. The mower has a 5 year warranty and the batteries have a 3 year warranty. Plus my Ryobi leaf vacuum/mulcher has the same stile battery pack and charger so this helps having a cross compatible ecosystem.

I've only had it a few months now, and my overlapping cross cuts no longer look like pin stripes and now actually look like a more professional cut. Plus the dual blade configuration helps mulch up grass clippings so I don't get clumps of grass in the lawn.

The difference a 2"" larger deck makes is really crazy, and even cut down on my time spent cutting grass, some people just don't care and buy whatever they can. However, I'd argue a larger deck will always result in a better looking cross cut and save you time spent on trimming your lawn.


For those of you with your heads in the gutter, take a cold shower.

EDIT: for those who think it's a penis size reference.
https://imgur.com/gallery/ry6u47L

Honestly, if you have to choose when buying a mower, push or ride type, go with the larger deck for the type you're getting. It'll save you so much time in the long run. Also, the newer electric motors have way more torque than the older ones."

Avyern1,unpopularopinion,1620442785.0,Alien (1972) is a really bad movie,"I can’t think of a single good scene in this movie. The suspense felt rather bland and expected, none of the characters felt powerful, with the strongest being the main character for the next few movies. It didn’t develop anything to make it feel like it’s own movie, it just felt like a really long set up scene for the next movies. The cinematography was good, and lighting helped the scenes feel less bland, but it still doesn’t fix the bad movie flow. If we’re going for complements, I’d say the alien looked great and the acting was rather good for the time, but aside from that I don’t see why it has such a cult following and 5 more movies were made about it. I’m just convinced that the following is solely from nostalgia rather than the actual entertainment value of the movie

All we learn is “strong alien thing is wanted by some space people because some reasons we’ll tell you about in the next movies” like why should I care about this? We only have two characters left who aren’t that interesting, (the cat is the most interesting honestly, he’s gotta be some robot alien cat thing with the amount of people he got killed in the movie.)

gmpklled,unpopularopinion,1620615687.0,Old people who stay in the cities are incredibly selfish,"Have been thinking about my own eventual retirement and realized that there really should be no reason for someone to stay in an urban/suburban center past the retirement age.

First of all, from a personal perspective, an old person is extremely vulnerable and not self-sustainable in a city, requiring way more attention from their family. Whether that's driving in a busy traffic, walking around and crossing busy streets, protecting them from more prevalent urban crime, or supporting them financially in a more expensive city environment. A cabin with a garden and a small town store is a much better setup.

Second, if they get sick, the medical help is readily available, pretty much obligating their family to get them that help, even if that means getting deeply in debt or taking care of a family member who is barely alive (things like strokes etc.) for a very long period. Personally, I would much rather prefer to be in a cabin in the woods, so that when my time comes - it comes. My family can collect the body and grief properly later.

Finally, from a society perspective, old people occupying prime real estate for decades until their death, while they are shut inside, drives up the prices and squeezes out young families who could actually make use of the neighborhood and jobs. San Francisco has entire neighborhoods where there is nothing but million dollar homes and old people, and they're not even rich old people, they just bought their house in 1965 and can barely afford to maintain it now. Coronavirus is another example, where young people had to stay in their tiny city apartments and lose their jobs, because grandma needs to shuffle once a week from her 19th century McMansion to the grocery store. This is a city, it's supposed to be overcrowded and dirty and full of viruses, that's where life happens."

I think if there was a closed species or a single OC and people were able to purchase that adoptable thru the NFT would be a great way to show ownership of the adoptable in a more official and digital way rather than word of mouth.

The Arrowverse as a whole is good

I am only going to talk about Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, Legends, and Batwoman. Not superman and lois, stargirl, or black lightning. These shows havent finished a full season yet/I havent seen enough of it to judge.

Arrow: Great; S1, S2, S5, First Half of S7, S8
Okay; First Half of S3, Most of S6, Most of the latter half of s7 
Bad; Most of S4, 2nd half of s3(some was good), Rest of S7


Flash: 
Great; S1, S2, First half of S6 
Okay; Half of S3, Half[or more imo] of S4, Rest of S6, Some of S5
Bad; Rest ot S3, Some of S4[ or not imo], Some of S5

Supergirl: 
Great; S4, Some of S3 
Okay; S3, S5, Some of S1&S2 
Bad; The rest of S1&S2


Legends: 
Great; S2, S3, First half of S4, first half of S5 
Okay; S1, Rest of S5 
Bad; Second Half of S4

Batwoman: 
Okay; S1

All in all: 
Great; 11.25 
Okay; ~6-8.5 
Bad; 4.75-5

Some of these are different in your opinion, but this is my opinion mixed in with the genral consensus on the shows. When the Arrowverse is goodz it is amazing. When it is bad, it can be disheartening and painful to watch. Give it shot, or if you stopped watching, use this as a guide to help you choose what to watch. 

People just crap on it because of how bad some of the worser parts are, but overall it is a great Tv Connected Universe and, imo better than any DCEU constructions so far. But we still have time for them to catch up to 8-10 years of Tv.

Most people especially in America treat homeless people like they are sub human and try to avoid them in anyway they can. I believe it's because they feel guilty and ashamed that homeless people exist but don't actually feel bad about them. Like not all homeless people are crazy addicts who are going to kill you (some are) just try and say hello and treat them like a fucking person not a burden you have to avoid on the street. As someone who grew up in the poorest US state and lived next to a large homeless camp in LA I've seen real polverty, I can tell you that homeless people are just normal people who need help, dislocating them and pushing them out of public view doesn't fix the problem it just lets people feel better cause they don't have to look at a constant reminder that the perfect world they would like to say they live in doesn't exist. Homeless people shouldn't be relocated because people deserve to feel guilty and ashamed in the system we live in.

Last_Interview_4332,unpopularopinion,1620568791.0,"Scope creep in the gaming industry is ruining games and that's why big developer companies are becoming so greedy; if gamers were less demanding, we might have had a better gaming industry","Companies moving to mobile games with predatory gaming mechanics, $60 games with more pay to win elements etc.

I feel like all of these are due to the massive scope creep in PC/console AAA games. And I feel like this scope creep is hardly contributing anything positive to the gaming industry. If there were no scope creep, developers would have been forced to think creatively and make fun and engaging games. But now they are making unfinished, buggy, cash-grab type games because players just want more graphics and bigger maps.

Some companies like Nintendo, Rockstar have managed to relatively insulate themselves from scope creep by doing new things or selling boatload of a game, but I feel like even big developers like them are not immune of the scope creep problem (the basic problem with scope creep is that it is simply financially less profitable or economically not viable at all) and the symptom that Nintendo is facing scope creep is evident from the fact that they are releasing a single, years old low-effort port for $60 to keep players busy.

Not to mention other developers like CD Projekt, EA, Ubisoft etc.

That's why I feel like indie games are generally more innovative and fun nowadays, but that's a different opinion.

TL;DR: Scope creep is eating the gaming industry alive for most big name developers because of their financial aspects. Until the players change their gameplay habits, we will keep on having buggy, unfinished, cash-grab, pay to win and predatory games"

throwawaythecatplz,unpopularopinion,1620646713.0,China should not have a democracy.,"I’ve lived in China for a long time, and as against the CCP as I am, I don’t think China being a completely democratic society could be stable or solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. Low involvement in politics overall. Maybe the older generation had more opinions, but since the censorship+ unable to express those opinions, younger generations born and raised in China do not have much of a political involvement, other than being taught to support the CCP. Most don’t understand government structures. 

2. History of authoritarian rule. Look at the history, there’s thousands of years where Emperors ruled the country, and instead of ever having a democracy, theyre just replaced by other emperors. While other countries protested for freedom and the right to vote, Chinese people were happy having a non-elected leader because most believe there is more stability this way. 

3. Chinese anti-democracy propaganda means that most Chinese citizens have a strong opinion against the US democracy, believing that it causes chaos. (still, low participation, but strong answering to the propogandas). 

I think older generations were still able to formulate their own opinions. For China right now, people either don’t have other political opinions or they move out of the country. Though I believe a democratic system is superior, I think China could move more towards Singapore’s model where it is essentially authoritarian rule in a democratic framework."

Now, my main complaint more lies with college board then anything else, but imma use the SAT as an example. They rarely provide goddamn anything, and it's not even guaranteed you'll get pencils provided. Each person taking this pays upwards of 100 dollars (where im at) to college board, so you think they would at least provide something. Food I can understand not providing as much, but they could at least make the smallest of efforts to do so - either with something like oranges

AP exams aren't *as* bad, but it's still nasty. They turned something that students need into pure profit, a huge amount. 2.2 million students took the SAT last year, and college board just makes out like bandits. 

They even put on pressure for students to sign up for their AP exams. I'm taking mine now, and I had to sign up for it all the way back in the first few months of the school year.

Sleep-system,unpopularopinion,1620467251.0,"A lot of men get a bad rap for being selfish lovers, but many women are pretty bad at it, too.","I was having a conversation with a female friend of mine who was saying, quite fairly, that many men don't engage in enough foreplay, aren't attentive or focused enough, and just want to get their orgasm and go. 

I know for a fact there's plenty of truth to that, but on the flip side many of the women I've encountered are also not very good in bed. Many don't have very good tactile awareness; moving too fast, too hard or awkwardly arrhythmic. They're not very attentive when it comes to noticing whether what they're doing is enjoyable or uncomfortable, sometimes downright painful, and it often ends up an exercise in mental endurance waiting for it to be over. 

I'm lucky enough to be with someone now where it feels organic and mutually beneficial, but a lot of that was because of clear conversation and experimentation to figure out what felt the best. It's not up to any one side to bear the sexual responsibility, it's a team sport.

Edit: I've seen a lot of comments upset because I'm conflating selfishness with poor performance. Of course they aren't the same, but they are related. It's hypocritical to say poor performance can always be solved with communication but selfish lovemaking is set in stone. A lot of men don't realize they're selfish lovers because they've never gotten called out for it and assume women do enjoy ""just taking it"", which is part of the porn problem. It's partially your job to check people who have gotten the wrong education when it comes to sex instead of writing them off as fundamentally narcissistic and unable to change. Communication can be tedious but it's necessary."
MassiveAd1221,unpopularopinion,1620435436.0,Brexit is logical and consistent with the UK/Britain’s past foreign policies and actions.,"I’m not here to argue whether Brexit is the right or wrong move for the United Kingdom. I am only arguing that the UK by voting for Brexit is simply being consistent with its foreign policy in Europe dating back 100’s of years. Whether you like or not the European Union is fashioning itself to be a major power in Europe and the world and promotes pan-European ideals and integration. This brings a United Europe closer to fruition than it has possibly ever been before (though if this will ever truly happen is up to debate). The UK has been remarkably consistent in trying to prevent any major power from gaining too much of a foothold on European power. From the Crimean war to WWI and WWII and the Napoleonic wars. Each time the UK has been instrumentalist preventing any European power from gaining too much power in Europe and therefor putting the British isles at risk physically, diplomatically, or economically. Germany in WWI sought to support its allies and gain territory, but in doing so ram the risk of drawing the ire of the world and becoming a superpower in Europe. In support of this goal they allied against Germany, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire to ensure that none of them gained a dominant place in Europe. Similarly the UK fought against Napoleon to stop France from expanding its sphere of influence into all of Europe and putting Britain at risk. Then again when hitler sought to carve up Poland they again supported France, Poland and all of the smaller European countries to keep Europe divided and fighting against itself. Then again in the Cold War the UK stood against the great red menace to prevent all of Europe from falling to the USSR. That brings us to today where through peace and economic cooperation the European Union seeks unification and acts as a confederation (though increasingly as a federation) which is against their historic interest and therefor by going with Brexit they are avoiding the fear whether real or not of a Britain subject to a United European set of ideals. Now that I’ve pissed off everybody go argue to your hearts content! For the record as a non European I am relatively neutral on the Brexit debate so take that as you will."

Amxela,unpopularopinion,1620437086.0,Pepsi Made with Cane Sugar is Worse than Pepsi made with Corn Syrup.,"In the US soft drinks/ soda /pop is always kind of a highly debated subject. From what we call it, to the brand we enjoy more, to what it’s made with. 

A lot of times these soda companies will make a product and then also release the same product but made with can sugar instead of corn syrup as the sweetener. 

When we’re talking Coca-Cola products the cane sugar variant is sometimes referred to as the Mexican kind. So Mexican Coca-Cola, Mexican Sprite, Mexican Fanta, and the likes. I find that these ones usually end up tasting better than their corn syrup counterparts. 

HOWEVER
When we take a look at Pepsi things are a little different. I’ve noticed Pepsi usually releases a cane sugar sweetened Pepsi around summer time and it’s not normally referred to as a Mexican variant. 

This cane sugar variant is also vastly inferior. I’m not sure if they change the flavor when they use cane sugar or what happens but it tastes waaaay worse than Pepsi sweetened with corn syrup.  
Pepsi sweetened with corn syrup often feels more refreshing and doesn’t leave a residue feeling in the back of your throat and on your teeth like the cane sugar one does. 

I’m not sure what Coke does right to make their cane sugar drinks the better variant but Pepsi is definitely not doing it right. 

My rule of thumb: Coke for cane sugar, Pepsi for corn!

K9DOBERMANN,unpopularopinion,1620605950.0,The theatrical ending to Little Shop Of Horrors (1986) fits the tone of the film more than the directors cut,"I’m sure anyone who knows about Little Shop also knows about the two different endings. There’s always been a debate on what ending is better: the one where the plant eats the main characters and wins, or when the main characters survive and the plant is destroyed. In my opinion (which hardly anyone seems to realise) is the happy ending suits the film version, while the dark ending suits the stage play.
In the stage play, the characters are horrible and selfish. Seymour willingly kills two people to gain success, resulting in Audrey being killed and later himself. The message here is “don’t make a deal with the devil and expect him not to collect”.
In the film however, the characters, particularly Seymour and Audrey, are much nicer people. Seymour doesn’t technically kill anyone here, he just gets roped into things like being unable to save Orin from suffocating. He even tries warning Mushnik at the near last minute before he is killed by the plant.

While I agree with the moral of the story, it doesn’t apply to the ‘86 film. The theatrical cut works better for the film, but the directors cut could’ve still been used as a dream sequence that makes Seymour realise he had to destroy the plant and could be used as maybe a redemption arc.

I don't even feel like oreos add much to stuff, like those slutty brownies I feel like the oreo stands no chance against how flavorful brownies and cookies are. It just gets completely dwarfed and isn't really worth the couple extra calories.

I will say though I do betray vanilla oreos in one respect. Fried oreos make oreos completely edible to me. Maybe it's the fact that the oreo is now this heated up gooey center. That the batter and everything works to enhance the oreo itself. That heating it unlocks the chocolate that lays dormant within the cookie and it being the center of the show let's it pop? Maybe idk, just don't wanna eat them any other way, I'm a golden guy all the way. 

Tldr: anything cookies and cream blows plain oreos out of the water. Golden oreos also beat plain oreos freaking easy, but fried oreos do something to me man."

LordoFlames,unpopularopinion,1620448655.0,I hope there isn't an afterlife.,"Everything I've heard about afterlife, mostly the belief that you either go to heaven or hell, sounds ridiculous to me. 

For heaven it's an eternal afterlife that's supposed to be all good and joyful, and you get to see all the people you knew who died yatta yatta yatta. But after a while it'd really suck and get boring. Sure you could also devote your eternal afterlife to gaining knowledge and picking up new skills, but what would be the point if you can't use them for anything? 
I've already had a point in my life when I thought life was meaningless, I don't want a meaningless eternal afterlife. 

For Hell it's an eternal damnation to punishment for being a bad person on Earth. What the hell would be the point of that? They did their shit in their life that probably hurt a lot of people. Those people aren't going to suddenly feel happy again or come back to life because Hitler gets a new pen pal in Hell. 

The best form of afterlife, in my opinion, would be Valhalla. Like at least then I died a noble death, get to spend my afterlife learning skills I've wanted to learn IRL, and have a purpose for ""living"" forever as to be a soldier in Ragnarok. This one would still suck because it's mostly just fighting forever until you permanently die in Ragnarok. Fuck that. 

Then reincarnation. Like if I died I'd rather live forever in Heaven than come back to live on Earth again. First of all life on Earth can really suck given the luck involved in where and how you're born. Not to mention no one has ever been reincarnated with the memories (at least not proven I guess) of their past life. So what would be the point of reincarnation if I don't remember who I was? Wouldn't be the same person. And if I did remember my past life it'd suck being a baby again. Although it would be cool for a bit, being the smartest toddler ever, I'd very quickly be sad, as everyone I knew in my life is either dead or at least most likely very far away. And then, assuming I got to live a long life with a loving spouse before dying I can't imagine it being easy to ever fall in love like that again, especially not without feeling guilty about what I did in my past life. 

Tl;Dr 
Death sucks and the afterlife is boring and pointless. I'm not religious, and when I die I hope I fade into nothingness with no consciousness. 

Preemptive RIP to my Karma points most likely."

Bravo_McDaniel,unpopularopinion,1620518553.0,"This whole ""LeVar Burton needs to be the next host of Jeopardy!"" circlejerk is really annoying and I bet a vast majority of the people clamoring for him don't even care about the show in the first place.","Ever since Alex Trebek died and Jeopardy! has been going through their rounds of guest hosts, there has been A LOT of fanfare and demand for LeVar Burton to host the show. At first it was fine, but the increasing fervor for him has gotten really annoying.

First of all, how many people begging for Burton to be the host are avid Jeopardy! watchers? You see a lot of these people demanding Burton on reddit, Twitter, and other social media platforms. A majority of those people are going to be young, and younger you get, the less likely you are to watch regular broadcast TV. The ratings have steadily been declining and vast majority of viewers are senior citizens.

Even when Burton guest hosts, I highly doubt these people will tune in for the whole two weeks. But really, why aren't they? With this much demand, the ratings on Burton's episode should shoot through the roof! This is what they wanted, so why aren't they watching all of it? Because they don't actually care. I can see a bump in ratings when he first hosts, but a dip after that, because again, those people didn't care about Jeopardy! in the first place.

Also, the #1 reason those super vocal people want him to host is all because of nostalgia. The only reason people even give somewhat of a shit about him is because he was on some shows when they were kids. ""He was on Reading Rainbow! He spread knowledge when we were kids, and now he can spread it to us as adults!""

That line of thinking is incredibly simplistic and naïve.,""He was on Reading Rainbow! Reading is knowledge, and Jeopardy! is knowledge! It's a perfect fit!"" Umm... so? Trebek wasn't originally chosen as the host because he was known for ""spreading knowledge"" or whatever. It's because he was an established game show host and television personality who was good at his job.

I have no problem at all with LeVar Burton guest hosting Jeopardy! and if he's the best of the lot, then he should get the job. However, these people constantly saying he should be the new host probably don't even watch the show in the first place and only want Burton because of nostalgia and internet bandwagoning."

MKBHD recently had a video about how we should take for granted the ability to repair our devices. 

While I believe the simple things like storage, RAM should be easily replaceable, this video was a pretty naive take on how many things can go wrong. I’m sure there are several repair shops that’ll do a great job, but just as many that’ll use crappy parts/take shortcuts, but when things don’t work on your device the way you expect it to, most people will blame the manufacturer. For example, if you get a third party iPhone display replacement and it starts glitching out in a year, it’s very easy to blame iOS, for example. And you might decide never to buy an iOS device again, which would be the wrong outcome for both Apple AND the consumer.

Controlling the experience is an important part of the success of a product, for both customers and companies. 

That said, I wish there was some kind of regulation controlling the cost of repairs, which imo is the best customer-consequence of RTR.

Also, I HATE how poorly designed and lazy the Apple designs have become. It’s not just that third parties can’t repair most things, apple can’t either. They just swap out your phone and “recycle” the product, which also has an environmental cost. I had to replace an entire iPhone because one of the mics stopped working.

One dog is chill and well-behaved just wanting to say hi to a new friend, and the other just wants to kill it (at the fault of the owner's lack of training).

Kendradollx,unpopularopinion,1620518113.0,If you buy a dog from a breeder or pet store you shouldn’t be allowed to access low cost vet clinics,"If you can afford a thousand dollar dog, you can afford a private practice clinic.  Low cost clinics are meant for those who need it, not because an owner wants to be cheap.  Low-cost clinics typically work with rescues and organizations around the area to help the overpopulation crisis cities face.  When you bring in your $1,000 pug, you’re taking the appointment slot for a shelter animal needing to be fixed before being available for adoption or a feral cat needed to be TNRd.  Poor people deserve pets and make suitable owners.  

If you can afford coughing up thousands of dollars for a dog, you can afford a full service vet clinic.

Edit: When rich people abuse low cost services, that directly affects poor people and their pets.  This shouldn’t be misinterpreted as anything else other than low income people have resources available, but the opportunities have been stolen by rich people wanting to save 40 dollars."

EliteVoodoo1776,unpopularopinion,1620507745.0,Social Media is a Social Godsend,"Now, before I get a ton of comments saying “this isn’t unpopular”, hear me out. Most of the time when people bring up “social media” as a broad term these days it is almost always negative in the media or in just basic day to day conversation, so yes. It is quite unpopular.

Set aside the fake news, memes, and attention seeking trends and when you boil down social media it’s an incredible tool unlike we have ever had for things like dating new potential partners, finding new potential friends, and getting jobs that we would have never known existed without it.

30 years ago say you’re going on a blind date. You have no idea who the other person is. You just know they are a friend of a friend, and that you know your mutual friend thinks the two of you could be good together. Then the date comes, you meet, and it goes to shit unbelievably fast. Nothing is right. You’re a terrible fit, and you have a bad night. So, now you have 2 options:

- Go on another date and risk it again thinking maybe this was a fluke, and risk having just as bad of a night.

- Calling it off and never knowing if they were just having a bad day or if it was something more and maybe miss out on a great partner.

Now? That’s not a problem. You get put on a blind date. You look them up. You can see their hobbies, friends, family, and job. They can do the same for you. Right then and there you know 20x more than you would have known back then. They like sports and money, and you could care less? Drop them. They share lots of the same hobbies and you know some of their family? Go for it.

I know that not everyone will see this the way I do, but I also know that social media is a great social tool."

bullshit-name,unpopularopinion,1620516037.0,The “flipping” or reselling of household objects is out of hand and should be discouraged,"I’ve been seeming this be very trendy lately among self-proclaimed entrepreneurs. There numerous accounts on insta/tik tok on “HoW tO mAkE $$ qUiCk” often involving people going to thrift stores and reselling the items they buy. I’ve seen some as well where people go to clearance sales and will scan an item to see how much they can sell it for on Amazon.

For thrift stores especially this is a pretty messed up practice as people are exploiting charities for personal profit. Especially places like the Arc or Goodwill, like there’s a reason everything is so cheap. This is places where people with good intentions donated their things  to a charity that benefits the most vulnerable in the community. 

I respect these people as much as I respect bankers. All they’re really doing is moving around inventory, artificially inflating prices, and contributing nothing to society. 

A perfect example of this is Nike’s new “hands free” shoes originally designed for people with disabilities. However, the vast majority of the inventory has already been bought up by 2nd party sellers. So anyone that actually wants to get these shoes for their original purpose will have to pay $600+ for something that was supposed to increase accessibility.

TL;DT: the flipping of found goods contributes nothing to the world and often exploits charities"

Sodableach,unpopularopinion,1620645109.0,I think it's weird how normalized the daily use of makeup is.,"First of all, I am not against makeup in general. I know for many people it is a way of self expression or even a hobby. Also I am a guy, so maybe there is something to it I don't understand.

That being said, I think the excessive use of makeup is way to common. Shouldn't makeup be something for special occasions? Shouldn't it be used in the context of dressing up? A first date, a wedding, a family dinner. But going to the grocery store with a full face of makeup just seems odd to me. 

In the long run it is altering our perception of the people around us. It's really strange how different someone can look to you without makeup if they had it on nearly every time you saw them. It's not having the effect of impressing people with how good you look, if it's used very rarely anymore, but rather the oposit, making you look like something is off or you are ill, if you don't wear it once after using it daily. And I think that is really sad. 

At the end of the day, it's everyones personal desicion what they do with their body, but if more women would use less makeup it would probably benefit all of us."

lynngu5,unpopularopinion,1620627622.0,Restaurants with mandatory “tipping” are desirable as a customer.,"First and foremost, I tip; I tip at least 15% if they at least consistently fill up my water, 10% if they were really rude and 18-20% if they were exceptionally nice.     

I just think it’s a super messed up system. Businesses should pay their servers more.       
Rude servers would lead to less customers and they would get fired. Good servers would be harder to come by but they would be good and also paid more because they wouldn’t work for cheap while also having to be nice and do a good job.     

Prices of food would rise, or “mandatory tipping” 
But this makes sure that the servers there are getting paid what they think is acceptable or they wouldn’t be working there. Patrons don’t have to guess how much they have to tip and they can avoid all this awkward “moral” decision making. The servers’ wages would not be contingent on how customers are feeling. 

Servers bitch about not getting good tips but they and their bosses love the system the most only they are dishonest about loving it for the potential to earn big tips.

People that leave exorbitant cash tips should probably pay into somethings that gets taxed but that’s a different gripe on its own."

Does a Roman statue belong to Italy because it has been there for a long time, even if it was made in Turkey by a Macedonian using Egyptian marble? Do expensive jewels belong to governments who don't exist anymore? Their successors? Personally, I don't think it matters. To me, the only important question is whether or not ancient artifacts are being kept safe, looked after, and receiving the attention they deserve on their own merit, not because powerful people somewhere else want to use those historical treasures as a way of propping themselves up politically. In essence, the claims of governments unrelated to the artifacts in question are all equal.

peanuts_and_pigeons,unpopularopinion,1620561245.0,Family-based work experience should matter as much as 'real' work experience in resumes.,"I feel that there is this socially biased stigma against family-based work experience, that it is somehow invalid or inferior to conventional or 'real' work experience. I think that it should at least be considered seriously.

From last year, I had been applying for so many customer and food service jobs, with every single one of them turning me down because there were always 'better applicants', presumably with 'real' work experience. So I was absolutely ecstatic when I was accepted by a chain restaurant in Sydney (peri-chicken. Since then, I've received showers of praise from others and my manager, in which we land on a discussion of how I have improved ""so, so much"" over the four months as she puts it. My co-worker points out that I used to work at my family restaurant, and I agreed.

**My manager says: ""but that doesn't count?""** 

Family-based work experience will differ for many people. I believe part of the stigma derives from the prejudice that people who work for parents just get it easier, get to pass time. But for some people including myself, we are more than just helping hands. Sometimes we take the same initiatives and responsibilities as other co-workers and we really learn how to do stuff at a young age. Even though I didn't have proper pay (my payment was getting to live under a roof), I worked just as attentively for my parents, even more than some of their previous employees. 

Hence, I think people should take family experience more seriously in resumes, especially for customer service, hospitality and retail jobs, where young job seekers don't have any other real experience that they can depend on."
hani-north,unpopularopinion,1620515105.0,Vesectomies should be normalised as a normal and acceptable from of birth control,"Except for condoms, which are not 100% effective, men lack birth control options.

Thus, the burden often fall on women. We are expected to be on the pill or another form of birth control. Birth control can have horrible side effects, such as blood clots and depression, and can be very expensive and difficult to access depending on where you are from. My experience were especially bad, I had my period for 4 months and developed chronic pain.

My main point is, the burden of birth control should not fall on one gender alone.

As of right now men have few options, although I do believe there are people who are working on creating birth control for men.

Nevertheless, I think it should be more normal for men to freeze their sperm and get a vesectomy. By freezing their sperm they can still have kids, and there is no possibility of forgetting to take a pill.

I also think this would give men more control. There are so many instances of men becoming fathers when they don’t want to. This is a constant source of anxiety for my male friends. Instance where women lie about being on birth control would be less of an issue.

Additionally, men by nature have the ability to impregnate more women then women can give birth. A woman can only have about one child a year and the window that women are able to get pregnant are limited. A sexual active man in his physical prime can cause far more unwanted pregnancies that a woman who is not on birth control.

Obviously this option isn’t perfect, but neither is how we currently do things. I would like to emphasise that I am only for voluntary vesectomies, bodily autonomy is very important to uphold.

To summarise my main point, the burden of birth control should not fall one one gender alone.

Edit: maybe “spread awareness and advocate for more options for male birth control” would be a more suitable title."

There's no addictive chemicals (those psychological addiction is possible, just like it is with a lot of activities), no fatal health risks (literally impossible to die from it), and it's actually used to treat medical illnesses (like cancer and glaucoma).

All you really need to do is enforce some sort of prerequisite on top of letting them smoke weed. Something like getting all As & B's on their report card every quarter, keeping the house clean and not making it smell, only being allowed on Fridays-Sundays, etc.

I truly believe that with the right rules around it, I'd let a kid over the age of 14 smoke some weed."
Sajoroni,unpopularopinion,1620559170.0,People who already own a home do not need a bridal shower.,"I truly don’t understand the point of bridal showers in this day and age where couples (oftentimes) buy and live in a house prior to getting married. Sometimes years before getting married. 


Bridal showers used to be for people to accumulate items to fill and furnish their new homes once they get married and buy a house... but I’ve you’ve already lived in that house for two years then what the heck do you need from a registry? 


I understand that nowadays some people want money for other things (honeymoon, for example) at the bridal shower... but then two months later I... give you $150 in a card... at your wedding? As your wedding gift? So now I’m giving two monetary gifts for your wedding? 

I thought of this because I’m the MOH in my best friend’s wedding. She wants to have a bridal shower BUT she has already lived in, flipped and sold two houses, and then moved across the country and bought a home out there. What could she possibly need from a bridal shower?


 To me it’s just excessive and I don’t think it’s truly needed."

justmikeplz,unpopularopinion,1620649277.0,"The future is already written, but you can re-write small parts of it (at least from your perspective).","Philosophers have long debated whether or not our past, present, and future is pre-determined-- the ol' Determinism vs Indeterminism debate.  It certainly *seems* like we have free will and are able to manifest an ever-new reality before our eyes, yet the sciences tell a story of a very predictable future for both matter and our choices.  Physics has *laws* of motion and thermodynamics which accurately explain our past and predict the future of matter.  A thorough understanding of Psychology and Physiology allows us to predict a person's choices given psychological and physiological norms and sufficient data on personal history or current environment (e.g. Mentalism).  It would seem that, without an intervention of personal free choice, everything in our universe (including us) would continue to flow in a manner governed by a set of known or decipherable rules.

Scientific experimentation around free will has proven time and time again that we don't seem to have as much free will as we think.  Furthermore, thought experiments presented in art and science ficition sometimes paint a grim picture of how special a human being's mind might be.  For example, *West World* raises questions about consciousness and identity by presenting an eventual ability to decode and capture a person's personality and resurrect them as a mechanical clone.  This idea suggests that human reasoning and action is nothing more than a flowchart imprinted within our brain that is activated through external stimuli.  The study of lower-level organisms seems to suggest such simplistic neural causation as well.

Nevertheless, new science around the concept of ""attention"" is being ""discovered"" which confirms what ancient spiritual practices have always taught-- that our body is a network of stimuli that can be observed *by ourselves*;  through practicing *awareness* and harnessing *attention*, we can observe a normally unconscious processing of information flowing through our body and dictating our life.  It seems to suggest that free will would not truly exist for a person without the intervention of awareness and attention.  Perhaps a person not practicing awareness would be no different than a robot repreatedly and incessantly following the instructions of its computer-brain as it responds to stimuli.  It definitely makes us wonder whether or not we are truly in control of ourselves.

In a hypothetical lawful universe where there were only robots with instructions \[and no free will\], it would appear that the future would be predictable and deterministic, but are we able to say that that future already exists?  Some theoretical physicists think we live in a ""multiverse"", where many parallel universes may simultaneously exist, including and alongside the one you are currently experiencing.  Some physicists even theorize that universes get created all the time through the collision of universe membranes.  On the other end of the science-spectrum, some people claiming to have various psychic abilities have claimed to be able to see into the past or the future.  It makes us wonder whether we can peer into universes alongside ours which run on different timelines.  Some scientists and laypeople even theorize that when our universe (or accessible collection of universes) burst into existence, its entire timeline was created and we are experiencing the predictable universe and the future that has already been written for us.  However, this notion reeks of Determinism and violates our instincts of having free will.

In the same way that we create and run computer simulations of the possible creation and path of our cosmos, it seems possible that we and our universe is a complex computer program or a beautiful song that was written and then executed or played by some unknown entity.  Then again, we seem to be able to get behind the running projected film of our minds; we seem to be able to intercept our thoughts and manifest a new chosen reality.  Perhaps when we make *aware* choices, we are just choosing to slide into a different parallel universe, for which the entire timeline already exists.  The future is already written, but you can re-write small parts of it (at least from your perspective).

TLDR; we usually aren't as free and aware as we think, but when we are and we make a free choice, we are selecting one of many parallel universes, wherein its entire timeline already exists."

But mothers who have chosen to not be active in their child’s life should not expect a Happy Mother’s Day and or gift. Especially those who have abandoned/estranged/abused their own kids. 

If you actively chose to not be engaged with your children, you should not expect anything on Mother’s Day that you have not earned. 

The same thing of course applies to Father’s Day. It’s really sad and disgusting to see an inactive or estranged parent expect celebration when they have not earned even the title of mom or dad. Imagine demanding a full day of respect when you can’t even show any respect to your children or other partner. Imagine only being a parent to receive praise. It’s really gross.

The only time this doesn’t apply is once again if you have lost a parent, or you are separated but they’re still at least trying to be active in your life. Active, helpful, nurturing parents definitely deserve the celebration. 

Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers who have truly, fully invested in their children without expecting praise. Being a parent is a full time job, and if you are committed to that job, I hope you have an amazing day!

Please feel free to comment what you think! I’d love to hear from anyone.

But if you’re dressed in your full tracksuit with a hood over your headon and a bum-bag in broad daylight, I’m gonna assume you’re compensating or a thief.

If you’re not wearing shoes and are wearing grotty clothes in a public space I’m gonna assume you’re a grub (I understand there could be reasoning for this such as homelessness/poverty).

If you’re wearing really fancy attire and all pimped up when there is no need to and you’re literally just shopping or eating lunch, I’m gonna assume you’re a pratt and probably think too highly of yourself.

So you get my point. To add further context, I am not a rude person, I just think people should understand that their gonna be judged based on how they present themselves, and if they have a problem with it then it isn’t my fault.

Why should female sports leagues be funded at the same level as men? Nobody can tell me aside from ""I think so"" or call me slurs. 

If they bring in the same crowds, generate the same revenue, and put on a level of athleticism and physical performance that is as entertaining to watch, then sure fund equally. But they don't, it's a failure on all three levels. Why should somebody get the same amount of money for sub par results? That makes no sense at all... I'm in no way saying don't fund it, I'm just saying not at the same level because that's literally unfair to those who actually earn that revenue.

Okay so this might not seem like a huge deal to most of you here either way, but lately as I’m sure you’ve heard, there’s been more brutal conflicts in the Israel-Palestine region going on the past few days with protestors being injured (not here to talk about the conflict itself). Some friends I know changed their profile pics on Instagram to show support for the Palestinian cause (a red background with anything related to the Free Palestine slogan), and even though I raised awareness on it on social media, I didn’t change my profile pic (I like the one of myself). 

Few hours later, these same friends are on my head asking me why I haven’t changed my profile pic yet since I clearly saw they did. Well, you do realize you don’t have to support a cause by changing a picture? There’s plenty of other ways to, and in addition even if I didn’t support the cause in ANY WAY at all, there’s still no reason to get on someone for not doing that. 

Tl;dr, don’t get on others’ case for not showing on social media in some way that they are in support or raising awareness of a cause in the world.

What I observe is that we're led to believe that workplace democracy doesn't really ""count"" — that its not worth including in our analysis of what a healthy democracy should look like, so people ignore it.

Anyways I find it incredibly frustrating this isn't widely understood and think it gives people a distorted view of this point in time of historical development."
JustALittleFanBoy,unpopularopinion,1620624115.0,You can hold someone accountable for something bad without thinking they're a bad person overall.,"Seriously. It seems like the ""cancel culture"" debate has split people into two attitudes: that you should never forgive anyone for any sort of imperfection, or that basic accountabilty violates people's human rights. And don't even get me started on the ""both sides"" guys, you aren't suddenly above everyone else for not having an opinion.

This goes the other way around too. The ""cancel culture hate mob"" usually doesn't think you're the next Hitler, they just want you to address the racist-ass comments you made in college, and it'd all be over sooner if you just stopped dodging the damn question, and admit your mistakes, David."

myaccgotbannedlol,unpopularopinion,1620624597.0,I find these amateur predator-catching videos repetitive and I have a feeling that most of them are a planned setup.,"There are 2 things I want to clarify before you read this post:

1. I absolutely have no intentions of supporting pedophilia.

2. Professional predator-catchers that are assisted and permited by the law in catching pedophiles are excluded.

These predator-catching videos are either fake or the predators that are caught are a bunch of stupid lobotomites, regardless I find these videos repetitive and weird for the simple reason of them getting easily caught and baited. Like what fucking predator falls for this shit? There literally hundreds of videos on the internet about catching pedophiles not to mention that they have millions of views, and their methods of trying to catch them are almost all the same (just say in your bio that you are fucking 13 years old and then boom you're done, you already attracted a bunch of basement-dwelling pedos in the same way a light-bulb attracts a bunch of disgusting flies).

How the hell do they not think about the possiblity of the person they are talking to being a fake decoy meant to bait and catch them? Don't they think about the possiblity of their conversations being screen-shotted? And most of these conversations feel so forced, straightforward, and blunt. 

Anyways I prefer watching professionals trying to catch predators such as Chris Hanson instead of these losers trying to make a name for themselves by trying to catch these so called ""discord pedophiles""."

1) Most of them look horrifying as fuck: 8-6 legs, a whole bunch of eyes, etc

2) They make me feel like I'm either in a motherfucking dump or an abandoned house: when I lay down on my bed and see a bug walking right next to my head, when there's a cobweb with a bunch of bugs stuck to it in a corner, when there's a silverfish or a roach crawling on the floor or wall, when there are flies or mosquitoes circling around me, when there's a spider hanging from the ceiling, when a bug is eating your food, etc etc etc, those are all fucking disgusting moments

3) They spread diseases

4) They lay their eggs around your house and then there's more and more of them

If you have mold growing on your things, everyone's gonna say you need help, but for some reason, having living creatures crawling around is ok? I think both of those things belong in a dump, not anyone's home. I have a net behind my window so nothing can fly in and also I throw ALL bugs I see outside immediately.

MsilCmd,unpopularopinion,1620539564.0,Corporate employees are mediocre at their profession and should stop vying to be top mediocre dog,"People take jobs at corporations, because they are mediocre at their profession, and they know it. They want a safe and mediocre job. That includes the executives. Exceptional people tend to found and/or run their own businesses, or work on a consulting basis for being the best in their field.

So, why do so many of these unexceptional people spend so much time vying for power scraps at what is by nature a career shelter for the mediocre? Why stress and scheme so much? For 2 or 3% more in an annual raise? So that 25 years later you can finally afford that convertible Ferrari, and drive it along the beach with no hair left on your head, a walker in the back from a bad hip and back, high BP meds in the glove box, and all of the young people you pass laughing at you because you look like a burned out middle age tool bag? 

All of the power and applause seeking just stresses you and everyone around you the fuck out, and never accomplishes anything that is more than mediocre. Work your 8 hours, doing the best job your mediocre ass can, get your paycheck, then go the fuck home. Spend that extra energy doing healthy shit with your life instead.

edit: to clear things up for the buttburt and illiterate, I did not say choosing a job for the mediocre is a bad thing. It's a perfectly good career path for a mediocre professional, and will pay the bills, and possibly be somewhat rewarding. The point here is clear in saying that the problem is people who scrape and claw and stress to try to be the top dog of the mediocre, stressing out everyone around them. If you're mediocre and chose the path of career mediocrity there's no point making it stressful, because being the top dog of the mediocre doesn't mean shit to anyone anywhere."
leekjuicewiththepulp,unpopularopinion,1620576090.0,There is nothing wrong with letting children see a non-pornographic sex scene in a film.,"To clarify: I don’t mean a brutal rape scene - or a rape scene of any kind, I don’t mean porn, I don’t mean some kinky whatever. I mean a plain vanilla, consensual & loving, non-super explicit sex scene (by ‘super explicit’ I mean things like the amount of screen time genitalia gets basically starts bordering on porn). I say this based off my own personal experience; growing up, my parents never covered my eyes or ears with these things. Mind you, I was “allowed” to watch that sort of thing probably when I got into the double digits, ~ten years old and up. Before that, if I would happen to walk into the room when a sex scene was showing, nobody would get up and scramble to shield my eyes, but they would casually pause the movie. Like I said, that stopped as I got a little older. Kids don’t need to be introduced to the concept of sex right out the gate, but I don’t think the “double digits” are an unreasonable time to start with that or expect that they would begin to be in the know. It’s better that the child ask any questions they might have of their parents, rather than Billy, who is just as un-knowledgeable and probably making up information on the fly because he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, in the school yard. It’s odd to me that scenes depicting violence are considered More socially acceptable to show children rather than a normal, natural, loving process. Both are fine to show, just not in the heavy-hitting ways."

mortismetal,unpopularopinion,1620540329.0,The Witcher 3 is severely overrated...,"Now if you enjoyed the game, good for you. Its decently polished, and I did enjoy it initially.

After reading the hype on reddit about this game, I decided to pick it up. I've played a significant amount of the story, right up to setting sail to Skellige. I played a lot of the side missions. 

The voice acting is so boring, I read the subtitles and skip the speaking bits. The UI system is awful. A lot of games keep text entries in a single area. The fact I have to check my inventory for relevant documents instead of the section that so obviously can be used for documents is a gross oversight IMO. The fact you can only apply upgrades (sigils n stuff) to weapons only when they are equipped to Geralt is another frustrating oversight. 

I have a massive gripe with how the XP system works in this game. Walking around the game world, you constantly come across monsters that you have to kill or risk dying. No XP awarded for the risk taken, just stuff for potions. Any engagement with world mobs feels like a chore.

The weapon degradation system is also frustrating. Having to constantly monitor how far off your weapon is from losing prime effectiveness detracts from my experience. The variety of weapons available is also a little disappointing. Spears? No. Halberds? Nada. Daggers? Ha NO. 

 Swords, axes, and maces. And a tiny crossbow. No shields.

The fighting, which was the most fun part of the game for me, was button mashing. I experienced more interesting combat from the Batman: Arkham series.

The story sometimes is unclear, unless you've played earlier games. So, maybe a longer introduction would have been nice? 

Fast travel is only from specific signposts. Thats fine, if the traversal doesnt feel like a chore - which it does to me. Other games that did this were Far Cry 3, Cyberpunk (I think), MGSV and the Arkham series. Except, I didnt mind running around in these worlds to look for clues and enjoy the experience...

Thats about it for my critques.

Positives:

The jokes are funny at times. Roach is a good horse. Food looks tasty. Enemy designs are gorgeous. 

6/10 for me."

amonrane,unpopularopinion,1620499266.0,Parents should not force their children to go on amusement park rides that they don't want to go on.,"I was on line for a ride at a theme park.  The ride wasn't what I would consider a super intense or scary ride.  Kind of a mild indoor roller coaster.  As we were getting on I see/hear a kid who was maybe 9 or 10 crying and yelling repeatedly ""I don't want to go on this.""  And his parents just ignored him and made him go on it.  Other people were looking at them, but nobody said anything and the ride operator just let the parents drag this clearly terrified kid on the ride.  I was like are they really going to make this kid go on this ride.  And, yeah, they did.

I know some people are okay with making kids go on rides they don't want to go on.  I guess the thinking is that they know it won't hurt the child, it helps them build confidence/overcome fears, and they think the child will like it once they do it.  Or maybe it's just selfishness because they want to go on the ride and can't leave Timmy by himself, so Timmy is going whether he likes it or not.  Either way I think it's messed up, bad parenting, and probably does more harm than good to the child.  There are better ways to help your child build confidence and overcome their fears.  And ride operators should be instructed to not allow any person on a ride who clearly doesn't want to go on it, regardless of their age.

EDIT: Just to clarify, it appeared that the kid got ""cold feet"" and  panicked at the last minute before boarding the ride.  I don't think the parents expected him to react that way.  We were near them in line and I didn't even notice them until the kid started crying and saying he didn't want to go on once we got close to getting on the ride.  The parents were just kind of laughing it off saying ""oh come on, it's not even a scary ride"" and ""you'll be fine"".  They were probably a little embarrassed themselves.  But I still think they made the wrong decision making him go on the ride.  When you see a kid go into full panic mode like that, you feel bad for him.  I think they should have just taken him off the ride."

tangre79,unpopularopinion,1620574125.0,The world would be a better place without sex.,"Seriously, think about it. The ""need"" (it's not a need) for sex makes people ugly. It makes them say ugly things and it makes them do ugly things, and it makes them make horrible decisions. It ruins relationships and marriages, it's constantly used as an excuse for bad behaviour, ""oh my spouse wasn't having enough sex with me so I cheated because I NEED it."" There's an uncomfortably large population of people who think cheating is perfectly acceptable because sex is just ""that important"" and ""there was no alternative."" That perfect balance of perfect sexual compatibility is almost impossible to find and it's what everyone looks for first and foremost, then they end up basing their entire marriage on sex, then are surprised when they're getting divorced 10 years later because something about that compatibility changed. People send unsolicited nudes thinking that'll help them get it, they say incredibly inappropriate things to each other thinking that'll help them get it, they'll cheat to get it, they'll rape to get it, they place all of they faith they have in the world in it, and are willing to stoop to incredible lows to get it. People will base their entire existence on it, they'll get it from any stranger they can and risk STD's, accidental pregnancy, rape, and murder for an hour of feeling good, and think a condom will protect them 100% from all of that, and claim that's a ""healthy"" way to live. It can result in a very serious addiction. Without sex, there would be no abortion, of which hundreds of thousands happen per year. Children have been victimized by it, animals have been victimized by it, people have been beaten over it, and people have been murdered over it. Foster homes are overflowing because of it, and many parts of the world are overpopulated because of it. If sex didn't exist and procreation was about as much fun as watching paint dry, people would be better, and the world would be a better place.

PyroAmos,unpopularopinion,1620585224.0,'You deserve better' is heavily over-used and often bad advice.,"I see all the time on here, someone tells a story and someone tells them 'you deserve better'.... you don't know that. You've heard one side of one story. Relationships (both romantic, familial and platonic) are complex, disagreements happen, regrettable things get said that can't get taken back... these are things that should be worked through in otherwise healthy relationships, not ran away from. Hearing one side of one story from a stranger isn't close to enough to determine anything, and having someone say 'you deserve better' can often be the excuse people are looking for to run away from an otherwise healthy relationship, rather than do the hard part of relationships and work through their disagreement. Maybe they're the toxic person and the story is a build up over time, and instead of fixing the relationship and working on themselves, you just told them it's ok to be toxic, ditch them and go be toxic to someone else until they break.

TLDR; Albeit sometimes it's true, throwing it out as a knee-jerk reaction to a stranger's story, when you don't know anything about the rest of the history and context of their relationship, is more destructive than helpful."

butthairmilk,unpopularopinion,1620627773.0,The chicken came first.,"Most people think the egg came first.

 If you google the question, you'll find most articles claim to have solved the answer using science. The wikipedia article on the ancient paradox resolves the question from a biological standpoint by saying the line that defines what a chicken is isn't as clearly defined as we'd like, therefore a ""proto chicken"" with chicken mutations laid the egg that became a chicken - still reinforcing the the idea both from a taxonomical standpoint as well as a genetic one. It even has references to Niel Degrasse Tyson, who summarizes the resolution by answering with ""The egg—laid by a bird that was not a chicken"". You can read the article yourself if you wanna but there's no point.All of that is bullshit. 

The chicken came first.

The answer lies with semantics and one obvious assumption: the egg is a *chicken's* egg. The question, ""which came first, the chicken or the egg?"" has no implicit reference to who owns the egg. We can safely assume the question refers to a chicken's egg because the only other options are an egg in general, or more specifically a *non*-chicken egg. In either case, the egg would have come first. Evolutionarily speaking, they did. Eggs have hundreds of millions of years on chicken's. 

The question therefore has to be refering to specifically a chicken's egg. We can ask the question 'what lays chicken eggs?' but the answer is a moot point because the question is not about what lays chicken eggs; it's about who does the egg belong to: the animal (chicken/protochicken/ w.e.) laying the egg, or the animal inside of the egg (the chicken). 

The fact that the egg has to be a chicken's egg in order for it to work as a paradox, implies the chicken owns the egg, and therefore the chicken comes first. Think math. Chicken + Possession of an Egg =  A Chicken's egg. We can't stop there tho, because who owns a soul/life/consciousness if not the body it's in?

A pro lifer would say life begins at conception. A pro choice standpoint argues 'my body, my choice. The pro choice argument obviously doesn't apply to eggs...since the egg has left the body, technically.

So how does all of this relate back to the chicken being the one that came first?

If you haven't guessed it by now, the chicken owns the egg it lays, even if life begins at conception, because a chicken egg is not made to be left in the wild, rather to be under the ownership of a caring mother until ready to hatch. 

That means ""proto chickens"" make ""proto chicken"" eggs that hatch into.......A CHICKEN! 

TL;DR: If you are an egg you have no rights."

benjix168,unpopularopinion,1620538167.0,Creationists are not necessarily flat earthers.,"I have been seeing this too much and I am tired of being lumped in with crazy people.

I want to start by saying that I am not a flat earther, never was and never will be. I base myself off what has been proven and observed.

With this out of the way, I also believe in creation. No, I do not believe the earth was made in 7 days, because a lot of things in the Bible are not meant to be taken literally, we have to use judgement and criticism to get a proper idea of anything.

Now to why, me, a perfectly sane person will believe in creation. I have 4 main arguments.

The first: life from non life is impossible. It has been calculated the odds for the favorable environment to be set for there to be an actual cell is 1/10(102). This is 102 zeroes. Mathematicians have also already established something is impossible if the odds of it happening is 1/10(50). It it thus many times impossible for life from non life. I won’t even talk about the chance there is of a random matter being pulled somehow in a random explosion creating beautiful galaxies and constellations and perfectly balanced. Bonus fun fact; it would be like having a disassembled clock in your hands, you throwing the whole thing in the air, and it lands already assembled. Edit: come on, I know it’s gravity, I just wrote as to say that saying it’s gravity does not explain everything.

The second: The concept of evolution is destroyed by a very simple fact; (and take the time to take that in) there is no genetic process that can make it so information is added in the DNA. What we did witness is horizontal evolution, aka natural selection, where fitting traits of survivors will be passed on to the next generation. There have been short-necked giraffes that did not survive because the vegetation died on the ground and only the tall ones survived, this is a fact. However, this process did not add anything, the genome is still the same lenght.

The third: we already know carbon dating calculates incorrectly. It has also been proven that carbon 14 exagerates exponentially when facing older stuff. We have carbon tested things we were sure of the dating, and the older they were the more carbon dating was giving a bigger age than what we knew as a fact was real. When doing the reverse math, what was millions of years, was in fact, around 4000-6000 years old.

The fourth: skeletons of half men half apes are incorrect. The nebraska man for example was based off the skull of an ape and the tooth of an extinct pig. The man of neanderthal was actually just a man with arthritis; https://historydaily.org/our-image-of-neanderthals-is-all-wrong-the-first-skeleton-was-arthritic
The list goes on and on and in the end, the is not one single cavemen half ape that exists.

My bonus argument; common sense. If you read through all this, thank you for reading. If you have questions or arguments or want references we can look that up together in the comments. For now, take a deep breath. Look outside the window and look at the sky. Contemplate our universe. Contemplate the beauty of our world. Contemplate how magnificent the stars are. Think of all the animals and dinosaurs that lived, about how intricate they are. About how we work and our bodies work, and what we can accomplish, and you know, deep down, maybe very deep down in you somewhere, that the world was not an accident. I won’t talk about religion, I just want you to think about all that, do the research, question everything and don’t believe in the first thing you’re told. I know it’s uncomfortable, but it’s worth it.

thr0w1tawayaccount,unpopularopinion,1620524368.0,I automatically think less of someone if they have a celebrity crush while they are in a committed relationship.,"If you think about it, if someone was in a committed relationship was talking about how much they had a crush on someone other than their partner people would be upset and that person's partner might consider it cheating. But somehow if that person's crush is a celebrity its considered okay. 

For example I know a married woman who has a huge crush on a famous rapper. She constantly posts ""I luv u babe, ur so hot 🔥🥵😍😩"" on everything that rapper posts on social media. She calls that rapper her other husband and gets her kids to call him their ""other dad"". She is just considered a super fan by most of the people around her. 

I know a lot of people that has a celebrity wife/husband and call me insecure but I think its unfair. It's like the person intentionally or not is comparing their spouse to that celebrity. I don't know if that makes me an insecure. I don't mind when people find celebs attractive but devoting a lot of time and energy to that celebrity seems foolish its even more foolish when someone pretends to be in a relationship with a celebrity. 

On another note I remember getting into a serious fight with an ex over a musician. I really liked their music and style and my ex accused me of wanting to sleep with that person. I couldn't explain that appreciation did not mean romantic attraction.

But that doesn't account for playing with friends or friendly people in general. You're most likely going to have a good experience because of playing as a team and seeking victory.

About my second point, there's ""feeding"". It's absolutely unessecary and just ruins the game. If you get killed twice in your lane, it's very difficult to comeback or even farm in the first place (That wouldn't be the case if you're playing premade because of coordinated ganks). That problem is what CS:GO does NOT have. You can eco in CS:GO and you can comeback, even after losing 5 times in a row. I mean, imagine NBA, but if you're behind in points, you can't do donkey shit because the rivals are stronger now. This needs to change. LoL needs to be a less punishing towards mistakes and more rewarding towards skill. Being fed and destroying the enemy isn't skill, only the early game could be considered that.

A fix to this would be giving MUCH less gold for a kill, a way for underleveled players leveling up without the threat of getting ganked, something similar to eco (a one life item that allows you to comeback if you kill), MUCH more gold for killing a fed enemy etc."

Every Mother’s Day and every holiday season, I get ads for some kind of picture book or app for adult children to gift to their moms, which will allow moms to look at pictures of said adult children and maybe grandchildren.  That’s advertised as THE gift that will make your mom feel happy and appreciated.  While it’s a good side gift, it should not be the only gift.  

To me, it’s narcissistic and thoughtless to make that the gift of the season to your mom.  You really think that after raising a human for 18 years, (maybe) paying for college, etc., the thing a mom would love most on a holiday/the one day dedicated to mothers are pictures of her adult offspring?  Ever wonder if instead,  mom might like a gift that is something she wants... something about her? 

Now, I get that moms love pictures of their kids and grandchildren.  That is something that she should receive on any random day or in addition to other gift(s).  While she might enjoy looking at pictures of her offspring, a mom is her own individual person with her own hobbies and interests.  She deserves to be valued as such.  

This rant isn’t targeted at anyone here.  It’s sparked by the endless ads I see.  I admit that the thought of only getting my mom gifts that are about me makes me sad.  I just think that after dedicating so much to raising kids, moms should be celebrated, not reduced to worshippers of their adult children."

Now on to why I think this is so: congestion. In a city/town, it's normal for cars to be quite cramped on the roads, requiring attention and sharp reflexes to avoid any accidents. Furthermore, there are a lot more potential hazards that can arise (a child chasing a ball out onto the road, a pair of workmen carrying a sheet of glass, etc). Contrast this with a typical motorway: there's much more space between cars, thus reducing the quickness of reaction needed to avoid crashing into someone. Plus, there are no pedestrians to randomly decide to cross the road. Finally, you can often see much further ahead on a motorway than a city road, allowing you to spot hazards ahead of time.

So yeah, that's about it. Remember: I do not condone texting and driving. Stay safe everyone.

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO CHEESY AND CHILDISH. So much of it is so uninteresting and dull, especially Rebels and Clone Wars. Most of it was just so poorly executed. The story telling was not intriguing, the humor was bland.

The Arrowverse as a whole is good

I am only going to talk about Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, Legends, and Batwoman. Not superman and lois, stargirl, or black lightning. These shows havent finished a full season yet/I havent seen enough of it to judge.

Arrow: Great; S1, S2, S5, First Half of S7, S8
Okay; First Half of S3, Most of S6, Most of the latter half of s7 
Bad; Most of S4, 2nd half of s3(some was good), Rest of S7


Flash: 
Great; S1, S2, First half of S6 
Okay; Half of S3, Half[or more imo] of S4, Rest of S6, Some of S5
Bad; Rest ot S3, Some of S4[ or not imo], Some of S5

Supergirl: 
Great; S4, Some of S3 
Okay; S3, S5, Some of S1&S2 
Bad; The rest of S1&S2


Legends: 
Great; S2, S3, First half of S4, first half of S5 
Okay; S1, Rest of S5 
Bad; Second Half of S4

Batwoman: 
Okay; S1

All in all: 
Great; 11.25 
Okay; ~6-8.5 
Bad; 4.75-5

Some of these are different in your opinion, but this is my opinion mixed in with the genral consensus on the shows. When the Arrowverse is goodz it is amazing. When it is bad, it can be disheartening and painful to watch. Give it shot, or if you stopped watching, use this as a guide to help you choose what to watch. 

People just crap on it because of how bad some of the worser parts are, but overall it is a great Tv Connected Universe and, imo better than any DCEU constructions so far. But we still have time for them to catch up to 8-10 years of Tv.

Even the bad seasons have some golden gems

WhatTheFlummox,unpopularopinion,1620613363.0,Towels work better as bath mats than actual bath mats,"**tl;dr** 

>Use a towel instead. They're functionally better in every way.

I've never understood the appeal of bath mats. Sure, maybe they're soft and cushy, but they just soak up water and don't dry very well at all, especially if you live with multiple people who use the same shower and/or bath frequently. They can take extra effort to wash and dry (especially if they have a plastic base), and their quality really declines once they start to get worn out.

So you have a several choices (there are probably more than just what I've listed here, but these are what come to mind): 

1) You can hang the bath mat up to dry when you're not using it.

>I have seen people do this. It takes up space on your towel rack that you could be using for towels. Even worse, it is no fun to be next in line for a shower when you have to take an already-wet mat off the rack. Lastly, as someone who doesn't do this, when visiting homes of people who do, I've often forgotten to place the mat down before getting in the shower and then I'm in bigger trouble.

2) You can just leave it on the ground and deal with an occasionally sopping wet bath mat. 

>This is what I did all through my childhood with my siblings. Would not recommend.

3) You can wait until you're mostly dry before getting out of the shower or bath. 

>Sounds cold and boring. 

4) You can try to keep your towel somewhere within reach of your shower/bath so you can dry off before stepping onto the bath mat.

>Perhaps this works well for some people, but I know I would forget to prepare ahead of time. Plus, not all bathrooms are set up with an easy way to achieve this.

5) You can keep a dedicated towel on the floor instead.

>This is what I currently do and I love it. Towels cover way more surface area than typical bath mats; they dry really quickly, even when you leave them on the floor; they're super easy wash and dry with the rest of your laundry during regular cycles; and even worn-out towels work perfectly for this purpose. In fact, worn-out towels are exactly the kind of towels you want to use. 

  
I first used a towel instead of a bath mat after I had recently washed my bath mat and had hung it up to dry, but still needed to take a shower. I have since gotten rid of my bath mat entirely and now use only towels."

5_out_of_7_perfect,unpopularopinion,1620498915.0,Initial drug use and subsequent addiction are due to lack of discipline,"For example, I'm not going to wake up one day and tell myself, ""I feel like getting addicted to heroin"", without ever using heroin before. The choice to use harmful drugs is your choice, and your choice alone. From my experience working in rehab, the majority people tend to blame everything else on their addiciton, except themselves. The first step to getting sober is taking accountability and admitting that you have a problem. However, from what I've seen, most addicts lack the mental discipline to overcome their addiction. Becoming sober is too inconvenient and uncomfortable to them, and a lot of addicts don't like to be in mental/physical discomfort, which is why they fall back on their addiction. 

Lack of discipline, and weak mental fortitude are why addicts stay addicts. That's my cold hard unpopular opinion that addicts don't want to hear.

Rehab gives an addict every single source they need to become sober. Sobriety is not something that can be forced. It has to be wanted by the addict. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

I worked in rehab for a year. Truth be told, most of the clients who came through were generally nice people, when they're sober. The problem is, they need an authority/environment to keep them sober, because they can't do it on their own. Rehab has an embarrassingly low success rate. Somewhere around 18% or so. It varies depending on the study, but always low. 

It's disheartening when you go above and beyond to help addicts become sober, only to see them return. Some of them purposefully relapse and return because they know that as long as they're in rehab, they're in a sober environment. Some people return because they're homeless and relapse on purpose for a bed and a meal for a period of time. Some people relapse and return because they want time off work. 

My unpopular opinion is that most addicts stay addicts because they don't have the discipline to overcome their adversity.

Edit: it's an opinion. Downvote if you feel it doesn't suit your tastes.

Edit 2: there are plenty of other ways to redirect addiction in ways that don't destroy your friends or family."

ThatMakhasheyfe,unpopularopinion,1620599973.0,Companies should be held criminally liable for not protecting employees against horrible customers,"Stress kills people and few things cause people who are paid to interact with the general public as much stress as horrible customers. It is generally accepted as fair and just that when other employees create a hostile work environment, the company is legally obligated to put a stop to it. Yet, when customers are involved, people suddenly think that holding the company liable goes too far. This makes no sense. Why should it matter that the person who is creating the hostile work environment doesn't get paid by the company if they are permitted access to the premises by said company?

Companies enable karens of all walks of life by letting them terrorize the employees repeatedly without consequences. Whether or not you have protection against this abuse as an employee depends entirely on which building you work in and who the manager is. This is unacceptable.

Sure, having consequences for companies that don't take the problem seriously may not solve the problem, but it's something rather than nothing. Employees should be able to report their employer's consistent failure to act against abusive customers and see results.

Edit: I should clarify. I am making the comparison to workplace harassment for a reason. The customers I am talking about here are repeat offenders who are demonstrably, consistently abusive to staff.

An instance of a coworker being unpleasant or one report of misconduct against them neither results in their termination, nor does it qualify as them creating a hostile work environment in most cases. It has to be an ongoing problem with that coworker in particular for the company to become liable.

That's the same type of situation I am talking about: repeat customers who terrorize staff. There should be some consequences for companies that tie their employees' hands and ignore a persistent problem with an abusive customer who has shown a pattern of horrible behavior towards staff."

2. You can easily see their progress as your benchmark, instead of setting your own benchmarks and using those around you to help you reach it, exceed it and do better
3. You start to feel what they feel - e.g. Let's say, you like kanye and kanye is sad because kimk has left him, all of a sudden, now you're feeling sad, despite having NO relation to kim or kanye, but because you idolised kanye, now you're basically emulating his feelings

I understand, that sometimes changing your perspective on how you view certain things, can be a barrier, particularly if you view someone as your role-model. So, I'm willing to give you some practical steps, to help change how you view your life differently(while maximising the better version of you):

1. Start with why - why am I doing this thing? If you don't have any true why, that feels like it's bigger than you, than you likely don't want that thing bad enough
2. Who do I know? Many people, usually jump to thing -> solve. Instead, why not just use those around you to help you achieve that goal or at least start working towards that goals
3. How - Once, you've exhausted who you know(and possibly some independent resources) now it's time to see how to do the thing you're trying to do

Now, I know what you're about to ask, how does this relate to celebs. Well, with celebs:

* you might see step 1 and be like 'Ok kim k, left kanye because of lack of money .... Soooooo, I can leave my bf or gf because he's broke' - which, of course is bad, but if you somewhat idolise that celeb, then you'll feel pressured to do the same.
* Step 2 - ok... who - easy - my bf/gf
* How - just copy paste what kim k did

In as much this sounds ideal, you'll quickly realise that doing what others do in exactly the same way they did it, can come with some serious repercussions if not delivered well....

&#x200B;

That's all I have to say.

TL;DR : Always make sure, you know yourself before you decide to copy/paste what a celeb has done."

IAmLegendll,unpopularopinion,1620610761.0,Jim from The Office is a simp,"I might get a lot of hatred for saying this but the character Jim from the office is a simp. Just to be clear I don't dislike this character, this is just my observation. Here are the reasons behind my statement: 
1. Before Jim and Pam started dating, Jim told Michael that Pam had rejected him twice. But he still has some feeling for her. That's fine. But when Jim started dating Karen, Pam who rejected Jim not once but twice, became very jealous about their relationship. And confronted Jim in front of Karen (Although Pam only talked about their friendship but it was totally a bitch move and pretty uncomfortable for Karen). Because of Pam's confrontation Jim literally dumped Karen. Total simp move.


2. Athlead: Jim threw away his new position in a company he cofounded and literally gave up his dream just because his wife didn't want to move into a new city. That really pissed me off. I mean how could someone just give up his one big dream only because his significant other didn't want to move out. 

There are some other reasons too. But these two are the main observations of mine. What are your thoughts on this?"
LegendaryHusky23,unpopularopinion,1620609841.0,"Record whenever you start crying, no one cares","Not sure if this is unpopular but here we go.

I don’t care if you’re really crying or if it’s just an act, and I don’t care how good the reason is.

The fact is that you started crying, thought “I should record this” and posted it for the world to see
(Idk why you would but if you chose to keep it for yourself that would be different)

Maybe your mom died, maybe you failed a test or maybe it was a breakup. All are valid reasons to shed a tear, but posting it is just a cry for attention.

The only excepting (maybe) is if you’re recording yourself and start crying in the making. Still that depends."
LawSchools2MuchPwr,unpopularopinion,1620493436.0,Planes Should Go Back to the Days of Projectors and Screens for Long-Haul Flights,"For those old enough to remember, the in-flight entertainment on long-haul flights used to be a collective, indeed, immersive experience. About an hour or two into the flight, a flight attendant would come down the aisle and pull-down a projector screen and everyone would watch the movie.

I remember the anticipation building before each flight when you went to the flight magazine to see what would be showing on that day’s flight, and I remember the dread inevitably setting in and wishing you were on some other route. “Awh shucks, I have to watch Batman & Robin because I’m Europe eastbound, but the people on ‘Pacific Westbound’ get to watch Titanic!” 

This isn’t a tale of masochism. When the movie was great, everyone was in a better mood. When it sucked, we wallowed together. That collective spirit was worth something, more than what I gain from having my choice of movie.

It was also an exercise in discipline  and patience we all can use time to time. Don’t like the movie? Listen to the radio. Take a nap. You don’t always get what you want. Sure, you’re paying, but payment doesn’t entitle you to whatever episode of Friends you want to watch, or live sports.

Vyrnoa,unpopularopinion,1620625144.0,Album covers are just as important as the music itself,"I feel like often times some (especially small) bands and artists dont really put enough thought or effort into their album covers. For me it just ruins the experience. The music can be great, but the whole project can be ruined if the art sucks. Its supposed to be a complete piece of the whole project. That includes the music, the quality, the art, the covers, the packadging etc. 

It makes no sense for people who put in hard work for music they make then just as a final lazy step slap on a random, ugly, unfitting album cover that ruins the piece creating an incoherent mess. 
I lose all interest in a band if the music is good but all of their covers suck. An album cover is art as well. Its supposed to display the vibe/mood/aesthetic of the music. Its supposed to accompany something beautiful. Which ties it all together.

The album cover is also just art like the music itself, it has value because all of it is in the same category. And should be. 

Bad album covers suck because:

First impressions are important to the viewer

They ruin the experience and creates a lazy mess

They ruin the flow of the work

It makes me not want to buy any of the merch or the album itself because why would i want to wear an ugly pic on my clothes. 

I want to support good bands but it just makes me cringe seeing this happen.
I feel like not many people care about this and thats fine but i cant help but feel that it bothers me whenever i see bad cover art"
daphnejmorgan,unpopularopinion,1620485943.0,John Barrowman doesn’t deserve the abuse he is getting,"Contrary to what some would have you believe, flashing is not an inherently predatory act. Sometimes it genuinely is just a funny prank. How many of you have mooned or been mooned by someone else? 

It all depends on who you are with and what the overall vibe is. Most people can read the room and know when it is and isn’t  appropriate to pull their bits out for a laugh. 

My brother and I flash each other all the time but, being siblings, there is an implicit understanding between us that that there is nothing sinister or sexual about it. We literally just do it for a laugh. The same goes for John, who is gay. His female colleagues know that he poses no real threat to them. They understand and participate in the banter. Think about it for a second. If they were truly disturbed or embarrassed by it, would they really be sharing funny anecdotes about “Little Barrowman” at conventions?

SomeWh1teDood,unpopularopinion,1620438402.0,In a way it is genius to be religious,"I'm saying this from a agnostic perspective. I dont believe in x God right now. But what I do believe is what we believe, is much more likely to become a self fulfilling prophecy, compared to if we don't believe it. Look at all the athletes, or people who have ever done something. It started with a belief for most of them. You'll find few people who say they made it to X spot without the belief. Its not the belief itself, but what the belief does for you.

If you believe a God is there and is gonna help you live your best life, and that everything bad that happens to you is to make you stronger, and that you are gonna live the best life possible to due a loving God caring about you, of course it will make you more likely to take risks and try your best to overcome obstacles. It doesn't matter if its wrong or right the belief (unless theres a God that cares) it only matters that this belief helps you live your life. So to the atheists who call it fully stupid, I think they are wrong af in this aspect.

. But if you think that reality is a meaningless fluke that that theres no God, its only yourself. Sure you can do great things in life but it can be more difficult to have faith when you believe theres no law in the universe that will give you X thing. Even if being religious is delusional, its got a hint of genius on it because it allows you to have a greater perspective than many. It doesn't eve need to be a belief in a God. It can be a belief in that life is a simulation and you are player 1, or your life is a movie. Whatever. Even if it is delusional, you can call it whatever, but I still think its got some genius written all over it."

Affectionate_Hall385,unpopularopinion,1620459952.0,I think less of people who are picky eaters,"So, a caveat.  This judgement doesn’t really apply to people whose pickiness is driven by them being neuro-atypical.  I know a few people who have OCD or autism that seriously manifests in the preference for food and discomfort with trying new foods, and I wouldn’t judge them for that.

That said, if you’re a grown-ass adult who isn’t willing to try new foods, who needs to order off the kids menu because all you’ll eat is chicken fingers or macaroni, or will shut down a group’s plan to eat at a certain restaurant because you “don’t like X cuisine” it’s seriously going to lower my opinion of you.

I think there’s a few elements to it.  One, I think in many cases it leads to disrespectful behavior.  I don’t think anyone needs to *enjoy* everything, but I do think that people should be willing to *try* most things.  If someone is having you over to their home for a meal and they put time and effort into cooking for you, I honestly think it’s kind of inexcusable not to willing to at least eat a bite of what’s being put on your plate.  Maybe this is different for people who were raised in cultures that don’t value food or meals as much, but to me there’s something just really gross about someone preparing food for you and you being unwilling to even touch it.

Second, I feel like it speaks to being sheltered in a way that I find off-putting on a personal level.  Growing up, either because of limitations in terms of time and money, or because my family had a diverse set of friends and relatives, I didn’t always get to eat what I wanted.  Sometimes, you had a plate put in front of you with shit on it that was unfamiliar, even daunting, and if you wanted to eat and not offend the person serving you you ate it.  If a child can do that, I don’t see any good reason that an adult can’t.

To that same point, I feel like it reflects a degree of close-mindedness.  Maybe it’s my personal bias and love of food speaking.  But unless a restaurant is just shit, I feel like there’s going to be something that most people will find tasty and inoffensive on the menu.  If you’re writing off entire diverse, expansive cuisines based on the fact that they seem scary, or you had one dish you didn’t like, or you smelled something unfamiliar I don’t have any patience for it.

Buck up, grow a spine, and try new things.  It isn’t that hard, and chances are you’ll find something you like.

Edit:  I’ll extend my caveat to serious dietary restrictions, within reason.  You have a life threatening soy allergy, so you’d prefer we don’t get Chinese?  Fair enough.  You can’t eat shellfish, so you won’t we trying the stew my mom made?  Totally get it — no hard feelings.  You’re gluten intolerant, so refuse to let the group get Italian, or Indian, or French, or Mediterranean, or...?  Naw, miss with that."

RaptorRoll,unpopularopinion,1620627724.0,Smithers from Simpsons doesn’t deserve sympathy,"Smithers from Simpsons doesn’t deserve sympathy imo, despite the writers lately frequently now trying to make him a sympathetic character or a moral representative in eps.

I’ve seen a lot of cases where he just looks down his nose at everyone except for Burns. He doesn’t care about anyone else and he looks down at the other employees. Examples of this are:

1. The episode where Smithers tries to get Homer fired for using Dimoxonil, and takes visible delight in this.
2. The episode where they have a skiing team-building skiing trip, and Smithers gets so upset he’s not put with Burns and may get fired, not caring about any other employee.
3. The episode where Smithers needs to find a temporary replacement for him and searches for “lazy, incompetent, monstrously ugly”, showing what he thinks of the other employees. He may well have entered these comments himself. There are also many other examples showing how he looks down at Homer.
4. He also wants Burns to be completely dependent on him in this ep and in general, even if it’s not Burns’s preference, and physically attacks Homer later in the ep.
5. In the ep where Burns starts recycling, Burns is invited for a speech at the beginning, and Smithers talks back to Lisa at one point like “How dare you talk to Mr Burns that way!” Showing he will aggressively defend Mr Burns even from children.

Despite this, they’ve tried to make him some sort of sympathetic character or moral representative in the recent seasons, such as the ep where he helps Moe re-cater his bar towards a gay crowd and Moe is painted as the greedy one with no values while Smithers is the one with morals.

His infatuation with Burns imo was just a bit of a ludicrous thing and a source of silly humour, a silly joke not meant to be taken seriously, but now it seems recently they’ve tried to paint this relationship as something to actually take seriously and it’s a bit cringy, and paint him as a character we’re supposed to root for or feel sympathy for or to demonstrate morals, and I’m just not buying it."

The increase in CO2 promotes plant growth. While this can be both a good and bad aspect, I would find it hard to believe this along with the other factors of climate change could cause a large collapse in the food supply. Genetic engineering and other technology is getting to a point where we could create plants capable of adapting to the new changes pollution will cause to the earth. We already do to a certain extent. Fish and other sources of food are now starting to be farmed to a larger degree and to expect otherwise is ridiculous, you would expect these kinds of farming tech to improve over time especially by the time ""climate change becomes dangerous"".

Now think of all the effects that will occur because people are damaging industry and production by enacting laws that hinder oil and other pollution producing industries. People tend to think that hindering these industries ""saves lives"" but really you may be just saving a few at the sacrifice of many but this isn't my main point and is ranty just something to ponder.

As for weather, it won't be a linear graph of more people dying the warmer it gets. Climate change might increase deaths by hurricanes, and it also might decrease deaths from frostbite.

In general Human's and all living things are quite adaptable, i don't see disaster as the only possible future to expect from climate change.

stinky-cat112,unpopularopinion,1620577087.0,"People who are 16-17 are not ""children"" or ""kids""","I don't think 16-17 year olds should be considered ""kids"", and I'm tired of people pretending and acting like people who are 16-17 lack critical thinking abilities, don't know what they're talking about or doing, and excuse their behaviour just because they're ""kids"".

I'm turning 20 and I still very clearly remember what it was like and how I was like as a 15, 16, 17, 18 year old. By 15, I was already figuring out my identity. At 16 year old my general personality started to become more established. By 17 I was pretty much a proto ""adult"", and at 18 where I would legally be considered an adult, I honestly really wasn't any different than what I was like at 17. I didn't magically become an adult at 18, it was a process that really started for me at 15.

So I really don't understand where the rhetoric of ""16/17 year olds are just kids"" because they're really not? Sure, my highschool classmates weren't the most mature and neither was I, we were still petty as hell back then, but we definitely knew what we were doing and had a basic understanding of how to act, how to be polite, what to do and what do say. We were essentially young adults by 16.

I'm really tired of people coddling or overprotecting 16-17 year olds on the internet because they're ""kids"", or using the argument to justify their shitty behaviour i.e. 17 year olds on twitter arguing with 18 year olds saying ""how does it feel to be bullying a MINOR"" when they're only a year older?

In my experience in school (not American) we were learning about historical wars and atrocities at 15, so why do people feel like 16-17 year olds need to be protected so badly on the internet?

Obviously the growing up process is different for everyone, and I'm definitely NOT trying to justify ANY predatory behaviour towards this age group (don't be a creep). But from my own experience and from observing my peers around me, 16-17 year olds aren't kids. They're pretty much young adults at that point, if they're being a little shit that's just them and we need to start holding them accountable!"
SouthPawXIX,unpopularopinion,1620568397.0,A group like the boogaloo bois could absolutely win if they attempted to go to war with the us government and here's why,"All we have to do is look to the past to figure out how the US fairs in political asymmetric warfare. This is the key, if you fight the US head on you'll get rekt but if you skirt around the USs biggest weakness you'll fair suprisingly well. That is ROE, rules of engagement. This is the codified stands for who the military can and can not shoot at and in 3rd world countries on the other side of the planet where no one has internet or speaks English it is quite strict, imagine how strict it would be when Americans are the backstop with their instant media coverage. 

2: Now to a layman, many of these guys appear to be armed to the teeth with vests and the AsSaLT RiFlE 15s, however as someone in the business I can tell you that most of these guys are absolutely not on-par with the us military, both in equipment and in training. The Middle Eastern  insurgents aren't either but the boogers are definitely better equipped when it comes to small arms than the insurgents. The boogers also have steady access to the internet and their formal education is way better than most insurgents which leads to better tactics and communication and overall survivability. 

Where the insurgents take the win is that they have more access to heavy weapons and ordinance. To spite popular believe, it is extremely difficult to optaine explosive ordinance in the US and any heavy weapon that falls into the definition of destructive device. The fact that US soil has been war free for such a long time means there isn't stuff just laying around.

Another note, there would be a large amount of us service members that sympathize with their cause, much more so than the insurgents in the middle east. There sure are now, atleast where their current ideology stands. 

I just used then as an example but this would go for pretty much any armed US political group

Kaptin_Odium,unpopularopinion,1620558910.0,Doom Eternal just failed to be DOOM,"I'm a fan of DOOM and it's been my childhood and teen's life when Doom 2016 reboot got released it was awesome I loved it then a few years later they released a sequel called Doom Eternal however eternal just was big fuck you to me as they have completely changed the gameplay mechanics. They broke the game's original gameplay core for the sake of their rock/paper/scissors bullshit.

The story itself has plot holes and makes little sense you start on some slayer base without explaining how you got there and why is suddenly VEGA inside your armor when your previous armor couldn't power him and why you have new armor. Nothing makes sense.

Excessive platforming: I understand the devs wanted to make exploration / non-combat gameplay more creative with the platforming, but they overdid it so much that it becomes a pain and a chore very fast. This is coming from a person who loves both Mirror's Edge games - games where the platforming is the entire gameplay. However, ME's did it well; something that I cannot say about Doom Eternal. Quite often you wonder where to jump next. Some of the jumps require absolutely perfect double jump, dash, dash combo timing in order to reach ledges. Regularly, I had issues with Doom Guy either not grabbing climbable walls by himself, or grabbing them unexpectedly, at which point I pressed the Use key myself in order to grab them, which in turn caused me to let go of the walls. Frustrating to say the least. What's worse, platforming makes up approximately 30% of the whole game. This makes me miss the long, 'boring' (i.e. beautifully looking, atmospheric and full of little details) corridors they were attempting to replace.

Entire combat loop: I am all for changing the combat a bit, but Eternal's combat is over-designed and bloated with pointless mechanics that nobody asked for:

\- Why add dashes? Nobody asked for them. What's worse, in order to balance things out, they reduced the player's movement speed. What was the point then? Also, they are on a cooldown.

\- They added a super powerful Blood Punch but nerfed the regular punch so much that it barely does any damage. Also, it's on a cooldown (i.e. to be precise, it requires 2 Glory Kills to fill). You lift super heavy doors but you cannot kill a fragile zombie until you damage him???  Why do you need some predator ripoff blade to kill enemies? Why the fuck Doomguy looks like some bad parody at a predator. In 2016 you literally killed them with your own hands and that was brutal you killed weak possessed humans without effort showing how powerful you are and that only demons can face and now even a fucking small zombie is a threat.

\- Pistol is removed just why and why? I loved the pistol design in 2016, super weak but infinite ammo making it a really awesome starting weapon but noo just because some speedrunners beat the entire game with that pistol we must remove it they only see 1% of the entire player's base and don't give a fuck about the rest.

\- Flame Belch's (or Flame Puff as it should be called) one and only reason for existing is giving you Armor. The fire does not have any other effect on the enemies: they do not panic, they do not receive any debuff. I don't think they even receive any damage and if they do, it is so marginal, that it makes absolutely no difference. And it's on a cooldown.

\- Ice Bomb. An actually cool addition. Pun intended. On a cooldown.

\- Frag Grenade. Better than the one in Doom 2016, especially after upgrades. On a cooldown.

\- Chainsaw is now required to spam, in order not to run dry after firing your gun a couple of times: this is due to the fact that bigger enemies (anything that is not pure cannon fodder) are much more spongy than in Doom 2016 and you can carry even less ammo than in that game. In Doom 2016 I used it more as a f\*ck-this-demon-in-particular button and the ammo was a bonus. Here, you very rarely have the opportunity to do so, since you have to use it constantly to replenish ammo, which in turn causes you not to have enough fuel for the larger demons. Also, guess what: it recharges one pip of fuel i.e. it's on a cooldown.

See a pattern here? In order to be effective, you need to manage 6 (!) cooldowns as if it's an MMO. Doom 2016 had only one, since all the equipment items shared their cooldown.

Now, the entire combat cycle can be summed up like this:

1. Shoot at non cannon fodder demons

2. Run out of ammo after a minute

3. Run around looking for cannon fodder enemies, which die to a strong fart

4. Set them on fire, maybe freeze them (when desperate for health), chainsaw them

5. If you get damaged badly, skip to step 3.

Rinse and repeat. Add some Glory Kills during this cycle.

The combat loop changes a bit when the Marauder comes along:

1. Shoot at non cannon fodder demons while avoiding the Marauder

2. Run out of ammo after a minute while avoiding the Marauder

3. Run around looking for cannon fodder enemies while avoiding the Marauder

4. Set them on fire, maybe freeze them (when desperate for health), chainsaw them while avoiding the Marauder

5. If you get damaged badly, skip to step 3, while avoiding the Marauder

6. Once everything is dead aside from the Marauder, focus on him

7. Change your entire behavior that this, and the previous game, have taught you, by standing still and looking for a slight opening when the Marauder's eyes glow green, because this is a 1v1 fighting game now for some reason

8. Repeat step 7 until either of you is dead

Marauder's design is puzzling to me. As mentioned above, in order for you to be effective against him, you need to do everything opposite to what this series has taught you. Mind you, I'm not talking about the difficulty here: once you discover that you can use a quick SSG-Ballista-SSG combo on him, he stops being so intimidating. It's just he brings the entire pacing of the game to a screeching halt, more so than the platforming sections. You can't stay at long range because he throws axe slashes at you. You can't stay at close range because he shoots the SSG at you. You can't stay at midrange, the one designed to be his weakness, because he may still frigging use his ranged axe or SSG or spam you with wolves for no bloody reason. Oh, and you can't use any Super Weapon against him (unless you are lucky and he spazzes out), because people would just blow him away with a BFG, and rightly so. The designer's wanted to create a cool, challenging enemy, instead they created a personification of everything I dislike in this game. And therein lies the problem.

The fundamental issue with this game is the fact that it forces you play in a specific way. Previous games gave you the tools and said ""go and have fun!"". All guns were, more or less, effective. Yes, this ended up with a lot of people cheesing their way with the SSG and Gauss Cannon, but why prevent them from doing so? If they have fun doing it, why stop them? The devs wanted to prevent this behavior and changed their philosophy to ""play exactly like we tell you to play or die"". There is no experimentation, no fun discovery. You are literally told what to do against each enemy in a small tutorial screen. And if you fail to adhere to these instructions? Well, this is the reason that the bigger enemies are so damn bullet spongy when not fighting them the 'correct' way.

But you know what is the saddest thing in this whole situation? You can still cheese with the SSG, Rocket Launcher and Ballista (stand in for the Gauss Cannon), though now only to a certain extent. This is still the most effective way of fighting, especially on higher difficulties! So despite all of their effort, changing the entire combat flow, adding tons of pointless abilities and annoying enemies, they still failed to prevent cheesing. Pair this with the sucky platforming sections and you have the ultimate failure of design: attempting to approach minor issues with a frenzied exaggerated knee-jerk reaction akin to taking a sledgehammer to a porcelain vase.

Now I have buyer's remorse. I pre-ordered the $100+ Deluxe Edition. Sucks to be me, I guess. The worst of all is I know that Doom Eternal is going to sell exceedingly well and, due to this, they will never go back to their previous design philosophy. They will continue on with the current one and I will not be able to enjoy a new Doom game again. Very melodramatic I know, but this is the future I predict and accept. Time to move on."
CarelessHoliday6812,unpopularopinion,1620555000.0,"""It's better to have no friends than to have fake friends"" isn't always true.","People underestimate how hard having no friends is. They say that, but it just isn't applicable to everybody. Having no friends is draining, especially if you're in a bigger collective and are not a loner. 

I am an older teen and at school I went through both having fake friends and having no friends. I wasn't happy in either situation. But I'll say this - having fake friends was 100% better. 

Having no friends at school means you'll sit alone during lunch, have no one to do school projects with, no one to talk about the minor things that just pop out in your head, no one to go shopping with, no one to introduce you to inside jokes or rumors the class has together. And most importantly, you won't be seen with anybody. Other people will treat you like a trash because of it too - assume you're asocial, problematic, annoying and that's why you have no friends. Teachers too. 
I found it so much easier to just switch a friend group than to try to join a friend group from the position of an outcast. When trying to switch the group, people just seemed to value my presence more when they saw that I am very much capable of having other friends.

It's horrible to have fake friends, I know about that, but having no friends can be even worse. 
As long as it's not something extreme (like the friends publicly humiliating and bullying me), then I'd pick fake friends over no friends even if it means they'll talk trash about me behind my back and would magically disappear if some catastrophe happened."

I know CPS is dogshit but at the very least there are some measurements. If a kid isn't enrolled in school, misses too many days, or doesn't have insurance. Parents will end up being visited for a wellness check to make sure they are taking care of their kids. 

I don't understand why dogs can't have these measurements too and I feel like if someone keeps violating these basic requirements of making sure your dog is well maintained. They eventually will not be allowed to have an animal.

So many companies (we’re talking thousands) use it for their logo design. GM, Toyota, Target, I could go on forever. 

As I’m writing this and you’re reading this, there’s probably five different advertising and marketing firms are looking at using Helvetica, Sans Serif, or some other bland uniform trash for the company logo or design. Whether it’s bold, thin, italic, oblique, it’s got to stop. Not every company needs to be minimalistic. There are probably over a hundred thousand or more different fonts. Why are companies so obsessed with their vibe being minimalistic instead of using typefaces unique to their overall mission? For example, Monster Energy has a cool logo and a good font to match with the logo, and on top of that it works with the spirit of the company. Rough, jagged, unknown, like a monster. 

At this point, when I see a cool font on a product or on a design of some sort, it catches my eye way more than minimalist fonts.

It tastes like sweaty rubbery nothing, and I swear they know it doesn't taste good on its own because they're always adding other shit to it. If its in beef form they add buns and lettuce and tomato and onions and pickles and cheese and ketchup and mustard to make it a burger, or they'll coat it in some weird sauce and call it a sloppy joe, or they'll add 10 pounds of seasoning to it and make it into meatloaf.

It just feels like an emotional mismatch for me when there's sexuality and laughter at the same time.

IAmNotABritishSpy,unpopularopinion,1620511543.0,Being Clean and Tidy is a Privilege Greatly Influenced By If You Are Wealthy...,"Edit: perhaps i should of written “neat” instead of clean, I feel That might be throwing a lot of people

Also, I’m not in a way declaring that this is absolutely the case for everyone, literally just saying it’s a big influence. It would be one thing to say something like “poverty increases the likelihood of addiction” and then something else entirely to say “poor people are drug addicts” for example. 

—

Basic hygiene should be a given, that’s not what I’m talking about here. I feel I shouldn’t need to emphasise such a thing, especially if the last almost two years has highlighted anything. But being tidy isn’t always possible, especially if your living spaces are small. The cost to upgrade such a space is well talked about and well known. I’m also greatly stressing the clean **and** tidy. 

I am an immigrant that came to the country I live without a lot of possessions. I have never been much of a hoarder and everything I own (unrelated to emergency situations) has been used within the past two years. My place never looks tidy as I can only afford to live in rented accommodation, in a place that hasn’t been significantly updated since the 90s. 

I would love to repaint my place to that all the walls no longer have scratches and smears, I would love to put in a new kitchen and make better use of the space in it, as I don’t own the property I live in I am unable to do this. 

I’m trying to get a better job, but Covid has killed my old income stream and almost frozen progress on my visa which has further limited my options, but it’s almost impossible to get out of this hole. With more money I could upgrade my living space, expand my living space and/or redecorate everything which is run down. 

It doesn’t matter how much I wipe and clean my old furniture and housing, it will never look clean and tidy unless I have the income to replace and improve on all that I need to. 

TL;DR, being clean and tidy is significantly easier if you have the space to store everything and a consistent income to keep up appearances within a living space."

velveteenbengal,unpopularopinion,1620550475.0,Dogs low-key suck and I don't want to pet yours.,"**TL;DR:** Your dog is gross, keep it away from me.

I realize this is a variation on things that have been posted before, but I feel it’s different enough to warrant its own post.

Let me set the record straight: I don’t *hate* dogs. I think dogs are cute, lovable creatures (esp pit bulls tbh), however, I don’t want to pet yours. I’ve been bitten by dogs while their owners watch, salivated on, and jumped on. I’ve never owned a dog, and this isn’t something that I’m used to. It’s uncomfortable for people who don’t like/own dogs.

I don’t want to pet your dog. I don’t want your dog to lick me, I don’t want him to jump at/on me. I just don’t want to interact with your dog AT ALL.

This post is sparked by 4 incidents in the last 2 weeks, though these interactions are *CONSTANT*.

**ex** **#1:** Dog owner approaches me at a park, coffee shop, hiking trail, etc. with a big smile on their face. “Xyz wants to say hi,” they announce, all grins and giving me an expectant look as their dog has already superglued their tongue to my hands.

I hate that I don’t get a choice in the matter. Before I have the chance to say no, fifi the havanese is already in my lap, slobbering on my face. Your dog’s tongue shouldn’t be touching your lips let alone mine.

**ex** **#2:** A particularly offensive scenario occurred after having to evacuate my apartment. I had to scramble to get a habitually anxious cat into a carrier and bring her to a noisy place full of evacuees. A woman approaches me with her (very cute) Australian Shepard, announcing her dog wants to visit as the dog has already stuffed its nose through a hole in the carrier. AGAIN, I DON’T WANT TO PET YOUR DOG. I do not want your dog whining/barking against the cage door of a shaking, terrified cat. How can you be so obtuse? I explained that the cat was nervous, and is scared of dogs. She backed away without complaint, but I resent that the onus is on me to set these boundaries. If I wanted to pet your dog, I would ask. Bringing him to me and another animal sans my request is honestly just rude. This kind of thing happens at the vet all the time, too. *My cat also thinks your dog sucks, fuck off.*

I want to clarify that I’m not advocating for the removal of dogs in public spaces. Dogs should be free to visit trails, parks, and any indoor area where they are allowed/wherever else dogs go. I appreciate the fact that dogs are autonomous animals who may insist on approaching others, but I really dislike the pressure associated with these interactions.

To add onto that, I often catch flack for this. If I withdraw/say no thanks, it earns me glares/passive aggressive tones/comments such as, “come on xyz, you can’t please everyone”.

Dog people, please understand that I appreciate your friendliness, and that I understand your actions are good-natured. I just don’t want to interact with your dog. Please be more conscientious and recognize that not everyone likes dogs. Just as it is common courtesy to ask before petting someone’s dog, dog owners should ask before letting their dog interact with others.

NerdismOfficial,unpopularopinion,1620570809.0,“Scott Tenorman Must Die” is NOT the best South Park episode.,"It’s a great episode and it really develops Cartman’s psychopathic character arc, but it’s not the best the show has ever made. That honor, in my opinion, goes to Margaritaville.

Personally, I think Margaritaville perfectly embodies what the show is capable of. Two plots, both relating to the same issue, both hilarious as hell, and both providing insightful commentary that manages to not be tone-deaf (unlike ManBearPig and Butt Out).

The plots themselves and the gags within them almost perfectly satirize the wacky state of the economy during the great recession. Connecting virtue-signaling about economics to biblical stories is genius, and honestly one of the most creative ideas ever. The idea that a stupid frozen drink blender can be artificially worth $90 trillion because of integration with the stock market is laughable but somehow plausible, and so is the whole “the federal reserve cuts a chicken’s head off and lets the body run around on a giant game board to decide shit” joke.

South Park is known for zany humor and spontaneous ridiculousness, and I think Margaritaville represents the peak of the show."

robertobaggio20,unpopularopinion,1620503524.0,"Son of Sam documentary, Maury was an awful journalist and person","There are some obvious points. He clearly led David Berkowitz and didn't ask any questions. He didn't want to hear the truth. Some of his links were tenuous in the extreme and to the point where I even think he invented certain types of ""evidence"". Almost all of the Satanist cult part had no connection, the process disbanded two years before the killings. Charles Manson was just inserted to sell more copies of his book. There were lots of clear and obvious explanations that he purposefully ignored in order to sensationalise this aspect. 

He clearly tried to profit from interviews, fear and conspiracy. The parts of his writing that were read in the documentary were very low in quality and inconsistent (for example he'd call Berkowitz ""Son of Sam"" but then say that he wasn't and it wasn't him) . Sometimes it felt like a teenager writing in high school. His writing was also very egotistical. He wanted to be at the centre of everything. He clearly neglected his wife practically from the first time they met and was an alcoholic for most of his life. He was not interested in working with police and solving cases and was more interested in self-promotion. He took advantage of victims. The reason he kept struggling to gain credibility was because he had none. He also clearly contributed very little journalistically."

For some people it might be fun, but those can do it at home, in their free time if they want to but to tell me I have to do it and actually giving out grades for your work even if you really don’t care is just pointless. I see no Argument why everybody should be taught in art. It’s nothing like mathematics or English classes. In those classes you learn something you can actually use and that makes sense. Even though you might not have fun you still see the reason. With art I don’t have that feeling, it never helped society to progress, you can’t use it in everyday life and if you’re not passionate about art you won’t create anything spectacular anyway. 
Man I’m mad.

This part is hard to explain, but in 2d form the remastered ruv's shoes proportions are insanely weird, I mean it literally looks like he broke his ankle or something. 

Second of all, there are so much frames that they don't even look like they match up with the music, considering it's at like 30 or 60 fps. The sprites are just kinda delayed with the music. 

Third, it looks like the characters are breaking their legs. With so much movement, for example twisting, (zavodila remaster) makes ruv look like he's doing jojo poses, and not in a good way.

Fourth, eye placement (proportions reference) is weird, since the eyes are literally going off ruvs head.

Honestly the only good remaster I found was the tord remaster."
shadowpillow,unpopularopinion,1620444981.0,Why take on the weight of the world – focus on your own priorities,"Regarding social issues and caring about them –

This is probably a pretty unpopular idea, but I think one of the real abnormalities of the modern world is this need to take on the pressure of everybody's else's problems. The idea that you /need/ to contribute to society. The idea that we /have/ to keep up with all of this, or else... what?

I get that it's largely because of globalization and the news becoming so accessible. It's human to hear about a problem and want to fix it. It's good to care. But taking on the weight of the world on your shoulders... What's the point? It doesn't fix anything. You're a person too. Isn't your happiness valuable too, not just a stranger's? Why not when you're trying to make the world a better place, start with your life too? When you're happier, the other people around you will be too, and that has a percolating effect. When you start getting down and taking on the weight of everything, or feeling anxious about needing to contribute, instead you will only hurt yourself and the people around you, and render yourself less capable of actual doing anything anyway.

Focusing on one issue at a time is good. Living your life is good. There's only so much you can do as one person; decide your own priorities and what you want to do. If that means fighting for a cause to better the world, great. If that means trying to get a high-paying job so that you can support your future family and kids, great. We each have our own priorities and fights. No need to take on the pressure of the world upon ourselves; there's no ultimate meaning or reason to anyway. We are all just people, with our own lives, priorities and reasons, personal history, dreams, and goals.

So why take on the weight of the world? It doesn't do you or anybody else any good."

laddlemkckey,unpopularopinion,1620586175.0,Neither DOOM 2016 or DOOM Eternal are better than each other.,"DOOM Eternal has much stronger combat and arenas, but is ultimately a lot more flawed overall, and even has not as consistent level design, and often has more annoying bugs and mechanics. 

DOOM 2016, one could say it's much stronger as an overall experience with the superior presentation, aesthetics, atmosphere, bosses, story etc... But tge arenas and combat for the most part don't push the FPS genre as far, or has as much depth. However it's more consistent and focused and consistent. But it doesn't push mechanics or teach you to be a better FPS player nearly as much as Eternal does, so Eternal can often reach higher heights in general FPS mechanics and accomplishments in the genre as a whole in many ways. 

Eternal can often be more fun and experimental at times, but the general experience outside of the combat, doesn't leave nearly as strong as an impression. 

Overall Eternal's better mechanically and combat-wise, DOOM 2016 still having amazing combat and design has much stronger experience, vibe, and consistency to it. 

Both games have their strengths and weaknesses, and I am not really sure if either game is necessarily inferior or superior to each other. 

I like both games equally, but I might give the slight edge to 2016 because I feel Eternal's much more flawed and buggy, and I don't like Eternal's art style and atmosphere nearly as much. 

Also I AM Vega is my favorite level in anything ever."

There is also no privacy. If you buy a new house and just smash all the walls you don't need out of the house you should think twice because if you are planning to have children it is better for you and them to have a little privacy.

Skyscrapers really started and boom in the U.S but in large part because the U.S doesn't have the same beautiful landscape that Europe has.  In general, Skyscrapers should only be build in places without beautiful natural landscape or with exception in developing country.  In the U.S, skyscrapers are build in the downtown district which is often ridden with homelessness.  

Another good example of this is the middle east such as UAE and Dubai which has no landscape other than desert.  Those skyscrapers make UAE and Dubai most more exciting to visit.

HelMort,unpopularopinion,1620574555.0,We don't need schools we need travels and charity around the world,"Take a kid and he will do whatever you will ask him. Take a teenager and he/she will be always frustrated, angry, disappointed. Schools can't help him/her because they're like cages for their passions and needs of freedom. I think the best is to let them go around to world to discover and learn from other cultures and countries, they need to test real life, to learn, to touch with their own hands. They need to go in other places to see the extreme poverty so they can understand how lucky they're and if they're poor to understand how change their country in better. They need to feel nature, big spaces, experiences and not to get closed for years in a room to die of boredom. 


Don't ask why teenagers kills themselves, uses drugs, shoots or whatever because the answer is very simple: we're draining their best years of their lives.

I just think that the new versions of ASMR (e.g. the titles listed below) are just.. on another level. I elaborated that in my post. I see many of you have opposing opinions and I just want to say I read them all and I really like y'all's POVs.

My boyfriend is a huge fan of ASMR. As far as this goes, I can understand that some people need it in order to sleep better/earlier or get rid of anxiety and stress. That is completely fine. However, through him I saw some really weird and actually creepy videos which I simply found disgusting and disturbing. Some of them have titles such as ""I eat your face and turn you into soup"", ""The VSCO girl sits with you and turns you into one"" and these are only a few of the many more which have really weird narratives. I simply don't understand how people can watch these. I don't know whether they are ironic or not (at least after checking the first video it turns out not) but I find them mildly disturbing and annoying, especially because there's people even in the comments who fetishize them. It's probably only me though, idk lol."
SlipperyMinstrel,unpopularopinion,1620553920.0,Pop culture has made it infinitely at choosing nuclear energy as a clean energy source,"off my head i can name so many different games, movies and shows that depict nuclear power in a very bad way.

The Simpsons; Homer is a bumbling nuclear power plant worker in charge of a source of power at the time thought to be dangerous

Comic books: often you find a villain or even a hero radically and impossibly changed by nuclear energy into something destructive. Consider Dr Manhattan as a literal embodiment of the Manhattan project.

Fallout: A game set after a nuclear war, and though you could say the focus is not on the actual nuclear energy or anything like that, the choice to make it set in that way does impact how people feel.

Not to mention that Netflix series on Chernobyl.

As we approach a greater need for clean energy we seem to shun one of the cleanest we have. Its not perfect but trying to find perfection is costing us valuable time we can spend on using nuclear energy, and that time taken away from worrying about carbon emissions can go into creating better renewable solutions without fucking up our planet. None of these things show nuclear energy the way they do are inherently bad, but we need a shift from only viewing it as just Chernobyl, just nukes and see it as an honest way to fix our dilemmas.

They should be given vegan mylk formula that provides dietary needs, growth hormones/accelerant, muscle stimulus and V.R learning (including seeing their parents and listening to their voices) so that when they leave the womb they are not helpless babies but around two or three years old (parents choice). They could then spend a year in some sort of rearing facility being taught physical and cognitive development. Their parent could visit them on weekends or when they are free and then finally bring home a four or five year old kid instead of a helpless infant.

Illustrious-Bass-783,unpopularopinion,1620465268.0,Meghan Markle might very well be lying.,"Piers Morgan was forced to resign because he refused to believe Meghan Markle's claims and had the balls to say so on national television. But considering that several of the claims have been disproved already, is Piers Morgan really in the wrong here? And if Meghan Markle lied about certain things during the interview with Oprah, why are people not open to the possibility that she could be lying about other things as well?

To look into some of her claims:

1. She said that she was 'naive' about the Royal Family and had no idea what she was getting into. Really? She dated Prince Harry for quite a while before they got married and for a good portion of that time, she actually lived with him, so she would have had a birds eye view of how the Royal Family functions. She has also claimed in the past that she did not know much about Prince Harry at the time of their first date, but several people have spoken out and said that Meghan Markle had been asking them about Harry long before that.
2. She said that Palace officials wanted to sweep her mental health problems under the carpet because it would be bad for the branding of the Royal Family. I find this incredibly difficult to believe. It is public knowledge that several high-profile members of the Royal Family have undergone therapy in the past, including Princess Margaret, Prince Charles and Prince Harry himself. So why would the Palace suddenly have a problem with Meghan Markle wanting help for her mental health? 
3. She lied about the 'secret wedding' that she and Prince Harry had three days before the televised Royal wedding. She claimed that they had a private ceremony with only the Archbishop of Canterbury in their backyard. The Archbishop has denied that such a thing ever happened. And the fact is, if it had indeed happened, it would have been illegal.
4. Archie not getting a title because of him being mixed race. This is another lie. Archie cannot legally get the title of 'Prince' because he is not in the line of succession. As simple as that. Seems like the Duchess of Sussex expects laws to be broken for her sake. 
5. Not being provided with security. Only certain members of the Royal Family are entitled to security that is paid for by British taxpayers. Others pay for their own security. 
6. Something relatively minor in comparison the the points mentioned above, but Meghan Markle claimed that her passport and driver's license had been taken away from her. Really? She has been seen driving around London several times- was she doing so illegally, without her license on her? What about all the extravagant private jet flights to exotic locations? She couldn't have done that without her passport. 

Considering that she has lied about all of this, how do we know that she has not lied about other things too? Her most sensational claim was that a certain member of the Royal Family expressed concern over what Archie's skin colour would be, but how do we know that she was not lying about that as well? 

It seems to me that Meghan Markle has created a complete narrative of victimhood and helplessness, and while the treatment given to her by British tabloids was abhorrent, she is definitely not as much of a victim as she paints herself to be. 

And finally, her hypocrisy disgusts me. She has gone out of her way to defame the Royal Family, and yet she expects the same family to continue giving her allowances, even though she is not a working royal anymore?

junkbox0,unpopularopinion,1620609566.0,Apps and websites that collect your information for advertising are good for you.,"There are a lot of people concerned about what information is collected about them and how it's used but what they forget is that data is what pays for the content they are consuming and keeps prices down. Let me explain. 

Nothing is free in this world, you know that. All those ""free"" BBQ recipes you look up tell advertisers you're into BBQ, that makes it cheaper for a hardware store to target you for their grill sale. Common sense says someone looking at BBQ content is more likely to buy a grill compared to someone looking at baby strollers. That website can sell their ad space at a premium saying they have the audience interested in BBQ and that pays for the ""free"" content you consumed. The hardware store can keep their advertising costs down by targeting the right people. If they have to target everyone not knowing what they're into, they'll have to spend more to make the sale. Guess who pays for that additional expense? You looking at BBQ content would probably appreciate seeing BBQ related ads instead of baby strollers, am I right? Oh, don't forget, without your data that website won't get a premium rate for that ad space, guess they'll have to cut expenses to keep it live. You know what that means. 

Do certain websites/apps abuse this data, yes. That goes with everything in life. Just don't forget all those times you saw an ad based on your online behavior and saw a great new product you had no idea existed. That's what it's for.

Yes, I work in the industry. No, I'm not worried about ios update, advertising is necessary and the industry will figure it out. Just going to cost everyone more than their browsing history."

The day has become very commercialized in this day and age. It has become more about showing the world how much you love your mum. And I am tired of it. It puts a lot of unnecessary pressure on everyone around, be it kids or dads or anyone else.


( Disclaimer- Geek language ahead, skip this paragraph if you don't want to read biology stuff)

Biologically speaking, in the simplest of terms, our genes just want to replicate themselves and want a best possible way to do so. Sometime during our evolutionary history, autosomes which certain sex determining regions stopped recombing and lead to the formation of sex chromosome ( If a fellow redditor wants to know more, go to Charlesworth, 1991). It gave certain specific skills to males and females of a species to help propogate their genetic material. In this deal, females got  genetic material required to grow another human inside them, they also got the instincts to look after the baby ( again for the survival of the species). So, I don't really want to commend half of a species for doing what nature them the ability to!

Now, coming to the social aspect of it ( I think it has been said time and time again), it's nice to be grateful that your mum took care of you, but do you really need mother's day to tell her how much you love them! Had mother's day not been thing, would you have been so ignorant to completely forget everything your mom did for you and act like a complete piece of shit. Apparently, now if you don't put a post on every social media about how much you love your mum and not get a gift, you are a shitty person ( not according to my mum's standards but according to the standards of society). Even, for mother's it brings a lot of undue pressure, with their worth in the family and society being judged by what their kids or husbands did for them. Most of the mothers I know, seriously just want some peace and quiet to themselves. I think the day might have started out as a decent effort, but now it is nothing more than pretentious posts , materialistic gifts and a picture with your mum on social media.

I could still wrap my head around wishing my mother and being grateful to her, but that's not enough, you have to go around wishing every mother that has ever existed on the face of this earth. If you like the day, celebrate it but please don't make it seem like the ultimate day of Redemption for everyone around you.

Anakin: wannabe good guy master Jedi emotional lil boy that finally cracked after bottling up his emotions for 16 years.  God. Damn.
 

She could have picked obi wan, liam neeson, Samuel l jackson, or even fuccing darth maul.  They met once.  They could have exchanged glancing blows in a paralell universe then started making out lmfao. 

 I'm just trying to say that there are A LOT of inconsistencies between the movies and they go as deep down as padme choosing Anakin when in real life or even in fake life, no girl (excuse me, princess or whatever) ever is going to fall for a dude that carries a pocket pair up his sleeve. (""I hate sand"" - Darth Vader)

Anyways, yea george lucas wrote that shit up over a spring break or something.. Wth was he thinking?  The prequels were sooooo... Corny af.  For the kids I suspect.  But did george know that he threw away an oppurtunity to turn the starwars LEGACY into 3 EPIC, serious, R rated, kids would hate their parents for years for not letting them see it, movies.  

Think about it, what if you threw jar jar binks in the fuccing trash and started over from scratch. 

I say, STAR WARS: GAME OF THRONES edition.  Without all the sex but with all the blood and the fubar aspect about it.  Nitty gritty real life SHTF star wars type of prequels.  Babies getting lightsabered and Anakin has to watch his mom get brutally murdered by the sand people then he has to eat her brains after.  He later found out that obi wan knew where his mom was and didnt tell him.  And yoda knew too but still didnt tell him.

Thing is, back in the earlier YouTube days, people loved his songs and didn't have a problem with the songs or music videos. Now you got people who are saying he can't play a romantic lead in his music videos when it's his videos.

His songs aren't amazing by any means but they aren't bad. Just because someone is cancelled doesn't mean the work they did is suddenly bad. 

If Eminem was suddenly cancelled, it would be odd to say his songs suddenly suck.

mariolucario493,unpopularopinion,1620609182.0,I think the grandmother in Coco got off too easy,"First of all, I'm not talking about Coco herself. She's perfect in every way. I'm talking about Elena, Coco's daughter, the one who enforces the ""no music"" rule with an iron chancla-wielding fist.

Also, spoilers for Coco ahead:

After rewatching Coco for the umpteenth time, I noticed one thing that really annoyed me about an otherwise amazing movie. I think that Abuelita Elena, the grandmother who forbids music, was too easily forgiven for emotionally abusing her grandson.

The whole Rivera family are kind of idiots for banning music in the first place just because of one ancestor's bad decision (Yeah, I know it wasn't his fault, but they don't know that). I get that the point of the movie is that the sins of your forefathers don't shape who you are (a great message for today's audience, btw), but I feel like the grandmother's arc is a little rushed.

Take for instance the scene where she smashes Miguel's guitar. Now in most Disney movies, when an overprotective family member lashes out at their child, (Little Mermaid, Brave, Mulan, etc.) they show at least some remorse for it afterwards. In Coco, the rest of the family appears horrified at this, but the grandmother seems to brush it off. The first thing she does afterwards is tell Miguel ""You'll feel better after you eat."" It honestly comes off as some type of cult-like conditioning, and I would call CPS if I saw that.

Now I know that a lot of traditional Mexican families tend to put emphasis on ""family comes first no matter what"". As for me, a whiter-than-white American, I am of the mind that respect for one's elders should not be automatic. I believe that it is important to love and support your family, but we should understand that sometimes the people closest to us might not always have all the answers. And that seems to be a belief that is becoming more and more popular every day.

Now to be fair, the point of the movie is that family love should be unconditional, and it is made very clear that the grandmother is in the wrong. I don't mind that. What I am a little annoyed by is how quickly she undergoes a change of heart at the end of the movie.

I'm not really a fan of rushed redemption scenes. I think if you want to redeem an antagonist, you need to do it with a lot of care and take the time to make the character sympathetic. Zuko from ATLA is one of the best redemption arcs in fiction for this very reason. In Coco, however, the grandmother just sheds some tears of joy at the end, and then we cut to a year later where everything has been resolved. I'm sure there was probably a lot of emotional turmoil she went through in that one year as she tried to regain her grandson's trust, but I'm disappointed we didn't see any of it. I know it's meant to be mainly Miguel's story, but she isn't even shown apologizing or anything.

My only guess as to why it was so rushed is because it would probably come off as a repeat of Imelda's (the matriarch of the dead relatives) arc, and the filmmakers didn't want to be redundant by having two characters learn the same lesson. But other than that one nitpick, I still think Coco is one of Pixar's best movies. Though I have to ask; if the whole point of the movie is that family bonds are more important than fame and glory, why does the Land of the Dead still put the family-ditching celebrities at the top of the social hierarchy?"
heckdoggo111111,unpopularopinion,1620579873.0,18 years is not sufficient to be considered an adult,"Through Covid, I’ve realized more and more that being 18 is not enough. I’m completely helpless on my own and many other “adults” feel the same way. 

The brain doesn’t fully develop until 25. We’re not biologically adults until 25... and even then, kids need help from their parents. 

I HATE to see adults say, “only 18 years more of this” and abandon their children immediately after they turn 18. Parenthood is a lifetime commitment. Kids did not choose to exist; their parents are to “blame” for their existence. Kids being kicked out of the home right after turning 18 is devastating. Think about who you were as an 18 year old. Odds were that you needed your parents. 

Especially on Mother’s Day (and Father’s Day coming up), it’s important to address this. Don’t you want your kid to wish you a “happy Mother’s Day” every year? Your parenting duties don’t end the day your kid turns 18. I’m so lucky to have parents and a home to come back to. Unfortunately, many others can’t say the same.

Jigsawfan12,unpopularopinion,1620631808.0,Men who have blonde buzzcuts don't ALL look like Eminem!,"As someone who unfortunately looks a LOT like Eminem (Facial structure and natural blonde hair) I find myself having to hold back anger when I shave my head because of the amount of adult bullying I receive in regards to how much I ""look like Eminem"". I love shaving my head, I love not having to worry about hair and also having my jawline/head shape stick out more. But literally every single time I do, everyone from my wife to people I do business with to my own KID and his friends make fun of me and make ""moms spaghetti"" jokes. Literally everyone from elders to actual children will make fun of me for this. It's really humiliating and annoying because I enjoy this haircut, but I can't have my own identity without people thinking I'm trying to look like Eminem. I'm an author for a living and frequently have people point out how my about me photoshoots in my books are just me ""Trying to look like Eminem"". Like I'm LITERALLY just EXISTING! Dying it dark doesn't even help because then people STILL think it looks like Eminem. Oh and I can't grow a beard either, BECAUSE EMINEM DID IT! AHHHHHHH! My own wife when we lay in bed together said that she feels like she was sleeping with Eminem right now and I wanted to cry.

Eminem is a VERY generic looking man with a buzzcut who just happens to be extremely famous, why does HE get to set the precedent for all men?! It's just really frustrating."

RoyalWait,unpopularopinion,1620443738.0,Argentina has a strong claim to the falkland islands,"the british came to the falkland islands after they had already been claimed and colonized by the spanish (see note). however, neither spain nor the UK was really interested in a war so de facto west falklands were spanish and east falklands were british for a couple years.

during the US revolution, the british were pre-occupied and abandoned the east falklands, and now all of the islands were under full spanish control, although the british continued to claim the entire islands.

in the 1810s, spain was now facing colonial revolutions and so they abandoned the falklands. but they continued to claim the entirety of the islands as well.

Argentina inherits the Spanish claim to the islands upon independence, and seeks to resettle this, but it's difficult. they succeed in 1828. Argentina seizes 3 US ships for disobeying argentine fishing laws. The US, which argues that the falklands don't belong to anyone, send a warship and dismantle the government. Most of the argentine settlers return to the mainland but 24 stay.

Argentina sends a new governor to the island but he is killed in a mutiny. The british then return to the island for the first time in 60 years, and sieze control over the entirety of the islands.

note: spain and france were both controlled by the house of bourbon, and had a shared foreign policy. Spain had always considered the islands to be theirs, due to the treaty of tordasillas. a french explorer claimed the islands for france and created a settlment, but france almost immediately handed over the settlement to the spanish due to the preexisting spanish claim."

So, usually when a dog comes jumping on me, or just keep around me expecting for some attention, I most of time ignore them until they go away. If somehow I can convince myself that the dog is clean enough, I may pet it. If I know that I'll have somewhere to wash my hands properly after touching it, I may pet it.

schizonipple,unpopularopinion,1620495460.0,The majority of redditors have irrational health anxiety,"A lot of the concerns and worries they have about certain things are technically true, but I'm so sick of seeing people on this site exaggerate the smallest things and acting like you will cause permanent damage or even die if you do something harmful once in a while and won't wrap yourself in bubble plastic. You have a little wound on your leg and you aren't changing the bandages and disinfecting the wound every 3 hours and 34 minutes? You're at high risk of getting a deadly infection and dying. You have a weird pimple looking thing on your chin? It could potentially be a life threatening tumour and you should see a doctor just to be sure. You took 1 Tylenol pill and drank a few beers? The combination between both of these things can be deadly, cause you to overdose, or cause permanent liver damage. You had something slightly traumatic happen in your life? You should immediately see a therapist just to make sure you're ok and help you process the situation (you apparently don't have the ability to process and deal with bad things happening in your life on your own). All of these things are real possibilities and dangers but they are very small things and not following conventional internet health advice to the t won't magically kill you. Unneeded and irrational anxiety when it comes to your health is more harmful to your health than popping 1 Tylenol and drinking a few beers once in the blue moon or smoking 1 cigarette. Reddit can feel like those medical blog posts written by white suburban soccer moms where they act like one scratch or bump on you can be potentially deadly sometimes. Unless you are severely immuno compromised or severely unhealthy little things like taking one Ibuprofen on an empty stomach won't cause any real damage or potentially kill you. I think the fact that reddit is an American dominated site plays a role too because the attitude towards these things in Europe differs vastly."

Yes, if you were born white, middle class, in the US (and avoided being one of the 2.2M soldiers drafted to fight in Vietnam) then chances are you had it pretty easy. If you were just about anyone else, life is significantly better today.

Today, there is less poverty, less starvation, more education, less censorship, more class mobility, and more access to life saving healthcare than ever before. 

People try to point out that college and housing prices are more expensive than in the 60s, of course they were, we didn’t let minorities get home loans or go to college! 

People try to argue that everyone deserves to live a middle class lifestyle just because they can breathe and tie their own shoes. What happened to the idea that owning a home or having a degree or a career was something to be achieved instead of a universal right? What happened to the understanding that it took sacrifice, either yours or your parents, to be lucky enough to be middle class, and that you shouldn’t take that for granted.

And it goes without saying that there just aren’t enough resources globally for everyone to have live American middle class. Hell, people living on the poverty line in the US today have it better than 50% of the world.

Rumle1708,unpopularopinion,1620600746.0,Touchscreens are horrible and unnecessary.,"I truly believe touchscreens are one of the most overrated technologies. Not that normal people talk a lot about, but tech companies implement them in everything and 90% of the time it is just annoying and unnecessary. 

First of all, yes touchscreens on mobile phones, tablets and similar devices are great! That is because a mobile phone is not made for 4-5 different purposes, where you could just have 4-5 buttons. Phones have thousands of possible button configurations due to their versatility. Also they usually have a touchscreen of high quality that feels responsive. 

However I’m starting to see more and more products with touchscreens built in. This could for example be a stove. There is absolutely no reason to have a touchscreen on a stove. And the touchscreens on devices like this are the cheapest of its kind. They are not responsive at all and you have press the button 3 or 4 times before anything happens and usually with a lot of force. The lack of response means no user feedback which is very important in product design. Take a button for example you have a nice click that lets you know the button has been pressed or a dial/knob have some resistance that lets you know the knob is turning. That means you have to put all your attention to the touchscreen if you want to operate it, which is unfavourable on a stove or in a car. A knob on a stove can easily be operated without the user paying full attention. Also a touchscreen doesn’t work when having wet fingers or gloves, which often the case when near a stove.

TLDR; Touchscreens most products are annoying due to unresponsiveness and no user feedback."

Ok_Strategy_9534,unpopularopinion,1620534835.0,If someone considers watching porn a deal-breaker it shouldn't be considered strange,"people will say drinking and smoking will be a deal-breaker for them and no one bats an eye and it's perfectly valid but if someone says that their partner watching porn is a deal-breaker for them they usually hailed as a prude or insecure, maybe for some their partner watching porn makes them insecure. That's okay. To me watching porn is a deal-breaker because of the unethical practices within the porn industry and because of the misogynistic, racist, and ephebophilic themes that mainstream porn has. Personally, I think it creates toxic ideals around sex and I don't think I'd be compatible with someone who is okay with consuming unethical pornography which most free porn is. 

Establishing boundaries within a relationship is important and what some people are cool with others aren't. It's about communication, but I realize how often women are hailed as hysterical for not wanting their partners to watch porn"
2-_-8,unpopularopinion,1620533324.0,Treating one's mental illness as if it's another person is annoying and unhelpful,"I see this quite often on social media, but also sometimes in person (in the few times that I've met others with these disorders and talked about them, ha), mainly in the eating disorder and OCD communities. People go so far as to call their anorexia 'Ana' and say things like 'Ana wanted me not to eat X but I'm gonna do it anyways! Ana is such a bully', and similar things where they personify anorexia or whatever eating disorder they may have. Similarly for OCD, I often see people giving other people advice like 'That's not what you're really thinking, that's just what OCD is trying to make you believe', or 'This is just OCD wants; don't let OCD win.'

I find this frustrating and quite irritating, honestly. It seems like a form of toxic positivity to me, but judging from the volume of these types of posts, most people would disagree. It's not so simple to just completely separate a mental illness from yourself, and you can't just automatically blame all of your negative thoughts on this illness. That feels like they're just trying to avoid taking responsibility for their own thoughts by saying 'No, that's Ana, not me'. I used to lurk in various eating disorder and OCD communities, hoping to see others' experiences that are similar to my own and to feel a bit less alone, but instead I constantly see these posts or replies to posts where people just say 'Don't worry, that's just OCD, not you!', and it feels quite alienating because I really don't see how that can be helpful to most people. I find it very hard to believe that so many people are really able to accurately classify their thoughts as being 'theirs' or their mental illness'. In my experience, a mental illness is quite intertwined with your personality, so this comes off as fake to me. My mental illnesses are a part of me and always will be, although hopefully they will eventually become a much smaller part of me, and I can't possibly be the only one who sees it that way, contrary to what these posts would imply.

These types of posts/comments/etc are so irritating to me that I've stopped trying to find any sort of community for support, because all I can find are those useless kinds of statements. They seem like the kind of thing that only someone completely recovered or someone faking positivity when really they are struggling in their recovery would say, and it is extremely unhelpful for someone who is trying to recover and doesn't have that privilege of being able to differentiate their mental illness from themself."

What separates idiots from educated folks is that educated folks will see something trending on Twitter and will EXIT the app to research it. Twitter idiots just read any tweet or headline and run with it. During the election time, there was a feature implemented where if you tried to retweet something without opening the link attached, a message would pop up saying ""are you sure you want to post this tweet without opening the associated link"". That was the smartest thing to do on Twitter's behalf because it encouraged people to actually read the articles they were boosting.  Everyone gets their news from somewhere, but it's vital that you actually research what you're talking about. It's easier to type something into Google and find reputable sources than it is to apologize publicly after misinterpreting a situation or spreading false information. Twitter has also hired a team of fact checkers and heavily moderates their trending news stories tabs to help prevent the spread of false information.

It's okay to first hear about a situation on a social media platform, but don't start climbing onto your soapbox just because user366127 has a tweet with 20K likes that says the world is ending."
Killer_Queen1999,unpopularopinion,1620483908.0,Pokémon should never say their names.,"Like many children I grew up with the Pokémon games and the anime. The anime Pokémon always say their names. You could make the argument that in the anime all Pokémon are named after what they say. 

Back in the days I always wanted the Pokémon from the games to say their names like in the anime. However in recent years I started to hate this idea. 

The games are obviously for children but Pokémon has a surprising big lore. Pokémon or actual animals or monsters. Pokédex entries mentioned dark themes pretty often and I like the fact that these adult themes are still in the games to this day. 

I can totally see Pokémon games where every Pokémon says its name with no interessiert lore or adult theme to be seen. 

I still see so many people who want the Pokémon to say their names in the games even though they are suppose to be animals and the recent release of New Pokémon Snap proved that. Though I haven't seen many people say this I saw some people say that they would have liked to see the Pokémon say their names just like in the anime. For me that would have destroyed the amazing atmosphere (Pokémon Snap is the best Pokémon game since Black and White 2 fight me). Pokémon are just suppose to sound like the animal they're based on. This is just how it is. 


I think the anime toned down the Pokémon name crys quite heavely in recent years and that's a good thing. Still I see many people who want them to say their names. The only exception I like is Pikachu. Pikachu's voice actress is so iconic that I always smile when I hear her. Even in the games and Pokémon Snap"
Ohigetjokes,unpopularopinion,1620479308.0,Intelligence doesn't make you a better person,"People often mistake bad behavior for stupid behavior.

Really the only difference is how good you are at lying about it. You can convince others that what you're doing is fine even as you're clearly causing harm, and you can equally come up with rock-solid excuses so that you even get good at fooling yourself."

Apparently it's about saving water, but all it does is make tap water just worse enough to use that it becomes annoying. If I'm using a tap in my house, I'm either washing something or I'm getting a drink; I don't want a head of foam in my glass of water, and it means the glass (or, more often bottle) I'm filling up will overflow before it's actually full thanks to the foam - a minor annoyance, but one that gets on my nerves when it's constant. It's even worse trying to drink directly from an aerated tap (yes, I do that - why should I bother getting a glass at 2am when I can just drink faster direct from the tap?). And if I'm trying to wash stuff off, having decent water pressure out of the tap makes scrubbing encrusted food or w/e off plates much easier. It's not a huge thing, but having foam coming out of a tap just makes it mildly more annoying to use with no decent benefit."
Nuewim,unpopularopinion,1620595356.0,"It is mostly parents fault that they never teached kids their skills, music/movie taste/job etc.","Many people complain their kids have no idea about do It yourself/repairing, cooking, that kids don't wants to have the same job as them or that they don' like the same music. 

But they never actually introduced kids to those  things. You can't just complain  to someone that is already 16/18 or 20 years old, it is too late. You need teach them when they are few years old, not in late teens. 


If you can repair everything at home, but you never even once tried to share knowledge or teach kid how to use screwdriver what you expect? They will be unable to repair anything in adult life. If you make  sandwiches for some who is 16/18, they won't magically learn how to cook after they move out. They will have 0 cooking skills. And it took years to develop good cooking skills. If you love 80's music, but never listen to it, then how your kids can appreciate it, if they have no idea about it? Or you have some job. How do you want  kids to do the same, if they have zero knowledge about what you are doing. You are for example architect, but your kids can't even draw or can't do math... Or you are graphic designer/programmer, and your kids have no idea how to use computer. Advising them to follow your footsteps  after they graduate high school is crazy tyranny. If you want something like that you should introduce them to your job when they were in primary school. Then they would have a real choice and maybe they will follow you. For example most musicans kids do it, with their own free will. Why? Cause they whole childhood experienced music at home, it is natural for them and they want do it. Most doctors on the other hand never teached kids anything about health/medicine, not even first aid. 

I am not saying kids will hear parents, learn everything and be the same as them. No. But if parents never even tried, their kids will be basically allien people for them. They will have nothing in common. Most parents ( no matter rich or poor) actually teach kids almost nothing. School, internet and ""street"" raise those kids."

Keeping them alive while they suffer both physically and mentally, full non stop until the day they're gone. You are doing nothing but making them suffer, which is ironic because it would be better if they're dead resting in peace than being alive suffering. It really upsets me. Another reason could be that depressed people, whi will live depressed all their life (ACTUAL DEPRESSION, NOT ""I'M SAD"") and that's not a quality life. Let people decide what they want to do with their own life. IT'S THEIR OWN LIFE. If someone wants to be gone, why you stip them? They haev their reasons just like me. Let people rest in peace. If you complain that ""this person has killed himself/herself/themself/xemself"" then why didn't you try to help? The hyopcrysy. Eithanasia should be enforce because people shouldn't be forced to live if they are REALLY suffeering every single day. Please stop the pain, can't take it anymore. Send help, anything. People call me crazy, but it makes sense that if you want peace, it can be outside this stupid and hurtful anthipathetic people have created.

Magazine advice columnists wouldn't last long if they replied ""just leave"" to every question. This seems to be even more prevalent if there are kids involved. ""Leave for the sake of the kids"". NO I am not going to leave my long term relationship with children because I have one problem with my partner and we bicker! What sort of message is that to kids?

AnonPinkLady,unpopularopinion,1620509384.0,Piercings are way better than tattoos in almost every way,"1. A regrettable piercing is way easier to hide or get rid of. Other than gages, most piercings are virtually invisible when you remove the jewelry itself and look just like a small freckle. Especially well cared for healthy ones that heal properly.

2. They age SO much better. As long as you wear light jewelry they often age well and change very little in aesthetic appearance over the years. Meanwhile almost all tattoos fade to a greenish or purplish color and eventually become blurry and hard to distinguish. 

3. They're faster to get done. Good tattoos take hours, and can be pretty painful. Most piercings are immediate and the pain is very brief.

4. You can change it up. Tattoos are the color and style they are, forever. You can get a cover up but that is just as challenging and painful as getting a tattoo all over again and eventually you wont be able to go over it again and it will become a black blob. Your colored tattoos will clash with certain outfits and just wont work for certain looks. Piercings can easily be switched out for different jewelry whenever you want once they're healed, for any color theme or style.

5. They can send a message or be completely aesthetic and represent nothing at all. Most tattoos have to reference something and generally arent just for aesthetic purposes due to the nature of the artform. You can get a meaningful piece of body jewelry or you can just sport something shiny

Overall I think they're just the more superior body mod. I'm not anti-tattoo though I just dont understand wht piercings are considered more taboo. They're seriously underrated"

This might just be me but for a while now everything kind of just feels kind of bland and samey from movies and tv shows/cartoons to video games and music for example I've always like animation and comics I loved shows like Beavis and Butthead, Courage, Power Puff Girls, Totally Spies, Billy and Mandy, FLCL, ATHF, Ed Edd n Eddy, South Park, Drawn Together, The Boondocks, Super Jail, Celebrity Death Match and comics like Spawn, Spider man, X-men, Hell boy, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. I stopped watching cartoons except for adult swim and south park around 2015 and I stopped reading comics way before that like 2008 so I decided to try watching/reading some of the newer stuff and my god most of them are bland and boring a lot of them have similar designs and some off the most milquetoast ""plots"" I've ever seen.

I get why they are most likely like this easier and cheaper to create and animate and to cast a bigger net for a wider reach of audience but none of it feels like something someone wanted to create but something board members wanted to create like a lot of it feels like it's boxes getting checked than a story or just something someone wanted to create but I recently watched invincible even though it's a super hero show which I'll be honest I'm kind of tired of super hero's but I really liked it. I think we have been in a risk taking drought for a while now what I mean is everything is already known brands which isn't bad but the people making the stuff already know people are going to watch the newest Marvel/DC/Star Wars/Disney/Pixar movie they already know that people will watch the newest reboot/sequel to whatever movie came out 10-20 years ago so they don't really have to try to as hard as someone making a brand new movie. So for the past I don't know 5-6 years or so everything to me has just been feeling very mediocre not bad but not good either majority of things have just been kind of a big meh to me and cause of this I think if someone was to release a movie like Blazing Saddles, American pie, Friday, Harold and Kumar, Cheech and Chong, Demolition Man today I think it would work and be profitable because it would be different to what's been coming out for last few years this also goes for everything else I mentioned if they decided that they want to be edgy and take inspiration from the stuff from late 2000s-how ever far back I really do think it would work. 

Will there be people who get pissed off and people who will ride the hate wagon because they saw someone else usually someone they like was pissed off about it of course that's unpreventable especially nowadays when people are looking to be mad about anything but if they don't care what these people think they can't really hurt them in any way other than being mad at them. For example look at people like Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Patrice O'neal, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Eminem, NWA, Snoop Dogg, Black Sabbath, The Misfits, Elvis, Johnny Cash, Tyler the creator and a lot more people have all had people get mad/offended because of what they did or said if they listened or cared about what those people thought we more than likely wouldn't have some of their best works. I think people should go back to stop trying to be for everyone and stop trying not to offend someone because while it is a nice and noble goal not to offended anyone it's also impossible not to offend at least 1 person or a group of people plus I think the people who aren't afraid to offend people often make the best stuff and I think that's because they are more willing to take risk's that majority people won't."

svbman,unpopularopinion,1620529191.0,Kids do NOT owe their parents respect simply because their parents provided for them.,"It annoys me when parents play the ""I fed you, put clothes on your back, kept a roof over your head, etc"" card to demand respect from their children. It annoys me, even more, when people thank their parents for doing so. It would be like me thanking a taxi driver for not purposefully running the taxi off a bridge and into a river. 

It doesn't make any sense. Parents are **legally and morally compelled** to provide for their children. Putting clothes on their back and feeding them is the absolute minimum expectation. Any less, and you'd be guilty of indictable parental abandonment. It pisses me off when parents think that providing for their children (food, clothing, shelter, etc.) makes them good parents deserving of respect. Parents deserve respect for loving and supporting their children. 

Your kid doesn't owe you respect because you gave them clothes and didn't starve them. Congratulations, you're a law-abiding citizen. You honoured the contract of childbirth.

Do I go around demanding respect because I haven't committed tax fraud yet? Of course not.  But it would not be dissimilar to parents demanding respect because they fulfilled their children's basic survival needs."

tumamafea,unpopularopinion,1620501548.0,Military retirees who do 20+ years of service who are getting their DOD retiree pensions and upon separation showed up to be in nearly perfect health and later on apply for VA pension are gaming the system.,"Military people who do 20+ of service and get their regular retirement plus their retiree pension should not apply for VA benefits on most cases. Younger folks with less time in service who really got damaged should be a priority over the ones who did so many years and are just aging.

I see a lot of older veterans who have decades of military service and did 20+ of service just fine and then apply for VA compensation and use as service connected issues things are normally parts of the human aging process.  This has to be under more scrutiny.


This program should be mainly used for the younger people who really get injured in mad ways whose future earnings in either the public or private sector would be hindered due to their now debilitating health.  Not for schmos who were capable to have a good chunk of an active work life in perfect health and are using as disabilities conditions that are mere parts of the human aging process.  Many of these conditions either are nowhere listed on their medical records, were never an issue upon release of active duty (the military does a separation physical), or they show up later in life. I’m mainly talking about physical ailments in here, btw.  Now for PTSD: there are two main causes; combat and sexual assaults.  Usually, for these two, mere psychological evaluations are not normally enough.  In the past years, the VA has been requesting things like buddy statements, some sort of any existence of any possible examination that matches the dates of event (if it was a sexual assault), second and third opinions from outside providers, and other more solid evidence (not every single one of these, but more than one at least).  There are other lesser known causes for PTSD, and the same also applies.  


It’s still a somewhat broken system, but I’d say this would be a step in the right direction to fix it.  Limiting the amount of older people who get these benefits.  The VA should focus more on the younger folks who are losing useful working years due to loss of health, not older folks who managed to spend years in good health and are suddenly using their aging connected arthritis as a service connected issue."

They’re all the same and they completely miss the point of superheroes. Stuff like Invincible and The Boys is built on shock and excessive gore, and it seems designed almost exclusively for teenage boys with attitude problems. A lot of it borders on grotesque and to me feels like a total perversion of superheroes in general. 

Superheroes are supposed to be aspirational. They’re our pop culture moral compass. I want to be inspired by their restraint and selflessness, and awed by their strength and ingenuity. I don’t want to watch a bargain brand Superman take dollar store Wonder Woman by the hair and turn her head around until she vomits blood all over her own back. That’s disgusting and offensive, and that describes a lot of this genre. The vast majority of these stories are shallow, obscene, and almost never as clever as they think they are. 

Alan Moore did it well with Watchmen, and that story still deserves to be celebrated today.

Then she got mad at him a few days later because he did not want to have sex with her. She gaslights him again. Then she gets mad at him because she wasn’t pregnant from the fucking rape.

Then she turned into a cold hearted bitch until the end where they have a conversation and Daphne goes “I accept that you don’t want kids”

FlameSamurai63,unpopularopinion,1620491118.0,Parents shouldn't have any input when it comes to a sport that their child is participating in.,"My little sister's volleyball season came to an end, and her team has a losing record. One particular thing I hated about this season was how the parents of more than half of the girls on the team demanded that their child play in more games, even though they clearly have no interest in improving or playing. 

The coach eventually gave in. The better players (such as my sister) sat on the bench quite often, and the lazy girls were put out on the court and practically did nothing to help the team win. 

My sister is one of the few girls on the team that cares about improving. Most of her other teammates just stand around at practice, goofing around and doing TikTok dances. The parents of these girls don't show up to practice to watch their daughters, and yet they demand that their child gets more play time in tournaments. 

It baffles me when parents like this sign their daughters up for things like volleyball when they have no intent of helping their child improve. It makes me even more upset whenever they demand to let their kids play when they don't even try to work hard at practice.

graysond,unpopularopinion,1620596696.0,"Disc Golf involves too much luck to be a ""sport""","First off, I know this is an unpopular opinion because of some of the angry blowback I have received sharing it elsewhere. The reason I hold this opinion is that there is  way too much randomness in the flight of the disc's themselves. While one can get better at throwing, there is never full control over an entire throw and there is a great deal of luck in the mix. Any random gust of wind can highly alter a throw and if the disc lands and rolls its all luck if you get a favorable roll, absolutely nothing to do with talent. I like to refer to discus, which is a sport that I have experience with. Due to the weight of the disc and the way in which the trajectory, flight and even landing is based on a good release and technique, its a sport. This however, is not the story with a disc used in disc golf. The weight allows for vast alteration of any throw due to wind patterns, which can vary at different altitude the disc is traveling through. This can highly alter the distance, stability of the disc, weather the flight path is straight or curves, and how the disc itself lands resulting in either a smooth skip or a roll. There are too many random variables in the flight of a disc in disc golf to be considered a sport."

However, in any other game it just either serves to annoy the player or to stress them out. 
  
For example, in Animal Crossing: New Horizon I really hate the crafting mechanic as it feels to pad out the game with unnecessary junk that you may eventually need and cause you to constantly lose tools and constantly be forced to rebuild or rebuy them.
  
Then in other games you have to craft ammo or healing items, I just don't like this cuz then it always has an extremely restrictive inventory system so that I have to constantly stress about what I need and what I can spare to craft item A or what I can toss to hold item B.

I'm really happy to be honest that Breath of the Wild doesn't have a full on crafting system, I liked just finding new weapons and not worrying about having to find unnecessary junk to combine into weapons or ammo."

clamchowder383,unpopularopinion,1620646442.0,Social platforms like reddit and twitter are echochambers for certain beliefs and are as dangerous as any other type of censored thinking.,"Places like twitter and reddit are socially moderated in a way that limits discussion. With the censorship of certain beliefs on some of the biggest social media platforms, I feel we are tipping the scales for future generations. To be clear I do not agree with the freedom to spread hate, but by censoring it like we do I feel we may be doing ourselves disservice. I believe being able to see real world social and political discussion online uncensored is important for people to see the entire spectrum and truly decide what they believe in. 

Reddit in particular is dangerous in the way it moderates opinion inconsistently. With mods pulling comments and posts the way they do it teaches an ideaoligy that peoples opinions of what you say matter more that what it is you are saying.

I know this post seems politically based so I feel the need to state that I do in fact vote blue. I just feel that echochambers in any capacity are extremely dangerous to society."
leaguegoderino,unpopularopinion,1620508128.0,Talent shows like America’s Got Talent and anything similar are immoral and dystopic the more you think about them.,"Let me start off by saying that this isn’t a completely original thought. I re-watched the black mirror episode “15 million merits” recently and ruminated on the prospect of talent shows a bit. I recommend watching this episode to anyone who’s curious about societies ailments today. It’s unsettling watching it and comparing it to our reality. Anyways, here goes nothing.

First off, the premise of talent shows are sinister. You have a few very wealthy and famous individuals who judge and dangle that same wealth and fame in front of you. It’s a power imbalance where they have all the control. It only upholds itself on a false premise that the contestants one day can become rich and famous too. Most of the contestants on the show don’t achieve that, not because they’re not talented, but because they weren’t fortunate. Also, there’s barely any people who got their starts from these kinds of shows. Even when they win or make it very far. I know there’s a few, but it’s very much the exception and not the rule. 

Another thing is the psychological warfare that goes on. The judges can be as rude as they want and the audience will always side with them because of the power imbalance shown above. It’s in humane and very classist. People in the audience who are working 9-5, some just barely getting by are supporting this? Sounds backwards to me. Not to mention that a lot of the contestants who audition have to perform several times off camera. So the abysmal people they let in from time to time? All for entertainment and being the butt of the joke. There’s been many contestants who speak out against this kind of stuff, but they’re shunned, ridiculed, and shamed."

Yukariioi,unpopularopinion,1620443729.0,IzuOcha isn’t a great ship despite it being Canon.,"

I know I’m going to get nailed for this, but please hear me out.

Izuocha isn’t a bad ship, however it sadly falls into the category of a ship which had potential to grow, but for obvious reasons it didn’t.

To start it off it is a very rushed ship. Even though they are technically not together yet Horikoshi definitely rushed an opportunity to make their relationship together grow like in the way he did with Izuku and Bakugou.

Unfortunately, this ship falls in the category of a overuse shounen anime trope. For example, the nice and kind typical anime school girl who supports the main protagonist throughout his journey, yet at the same time has little to no importance other than being a love interest to him.

It’s canon, but in my opinion very predictable and not original.

Uraraka Ochako isn’t completely a typical anime girl. She is smart, determined, and strong, however do to how her character in a whole is being handled she just faded into the background. Nothing plain about her, but just is a character who doesn’t stand out much even when the spotlight is on her.
 
Technically speaking she does have some Character development, but it is so subtle it’s not really enough to be acknowledge. 

The ship overall is good, but not anything new. In a way kind of plain do to the lack of actual character development between the two, and as I said before overusing character themes. 

Overly blushing and stammering when someone mentions one of them can get a bit to much from time to time. One of the best ways to develop a character is to have interactions with the two characters, but as the series goes on their interactions get less.. and less... and.. yeah.

There wasn’t even enough discussion with the two when Uraraka all of a sudden confessed she may have a crush on Izuku back in season 3. In my opinion this was way to early to be developing this type of feelings. I feel like it should’ve been put of until later in the series like in season 5. 

It’s like the two don’t even talk anymore, and when they do it almost always has something to do with school, work, exams, training, e.t.c.
 
I am aware that since it is a shounen anime it will not have many romance happening, however when it does in this anime it is filled with useless pinning, and constant tropes.

I am not trying to bash or go after Horikoshi for doing things that particular way, he is a great manga creator, but he could’ve given a little more thought into creating a different situation for the two instead of going with the cliché scenarios used by hundreds of animes. 

That being said I hope you understand my perspective, and have a great day!"

AConcernedTaxpayer,unpopularopinion,1620436254.0,The pear is NOT a pretentious fruit,"It goes without saying that the pear is one of the most, if not THE most, stigmatized fruit out there. As such, people will usually judge you for buying pears and assume your intentions for doing so are shallow. Though few people might actually do it just to show off their wealth or establish dominance in the fresh fruits aisle, I think it's fair to say that most just like pears. And so, how is it fair to treat us like that, and more importantly, is there some basis to that stigma?

The underlying principle is that particularly expensive food items are not usually considered essentials, even though they fulfill a basic need. Since you don't specifically need them, they instead fall in a different class of product broadly known as luxuries. Then obviously, the economics of it causes a perception biais towards the people that can actually afford it, and the whole thing is fueled by a cycle of envy. Here's the thing though, I don't think this applies here, because the price is actually fair. In fact, pears usually sells for about the same price as apples, which means the only two cheaper fruits are bananas and oranges. Furthermore, it is widely available, and so it doesn't make sense to include it in the slightly uncommon fruit category along with kiwi and whatnot. It is not even an imported products in most countries, thanks to its forgiving growing requirements. And for these reasons, I think it is a highly misunderstood fruit. I strongly believe that the pear is actually a humble working-class fruit perfectly suitable for middle income families. Anyway, just my two cents, thanks for reading."

This opinion might be unpopular because whenever one tries to question a cryptocurrency, all the people who are bullish on (believers of) crypto start a rant about how people just don't understand cryptos and whatnot. I am actually concerned because people are putting stupid amounts of money into this, without realising that there is no fundamental problem that Dogecoin was created to solve, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum. It was created as a joke and should be treated as such. Many finance YouTubers are aggressively covering it on their channels and their Instagram, without realising that it is causing people with not a lot of money to take notice and invest money into it, money that they cannot afford to lose. Sure, they slide a disclaimer in which says that what they're covering is not financial advice, but come on, it indirectly pushes more attention to it anyway.

Back in the good old days if I misspelled a word, it would have a red line under it, telling you to go fix it. Annoying but safe.

Now if I misspell a word, it fixes it, great except in many cases I have no idea it happened and I'll keep making the mistake and one day auto correct won't be there to save me like on paper or a whiteboard.

It's not so bad on a phone since you can see the change in word happen in real time. The movement makes you look at it and notice.
On a computer (espically if you aren't good at typing or unfamiliar with the keyboard in case you use multiple devices) it's very easy to miss.

It's really bad when you spelled it correctly (maybe a name) and the genius computer changes it a commonly used word with similar spelling. It pats itself on the back and doesn't even show that it made a change without your explicit input.

Either autocorrected words should be highlighted so people can check the correction later or just give me back my spell check and red underline."

I don’t really buy into it. The British empire had curbed slavery in their territories (I know the still did really evil shit but they did a bit less of it) whereas slavery was rampant in America. Also, the argument that the colonists wanted “representation” is kinda BS cause only a fraction of them would actually get it (property holding men). The British just wanted tax revenue back for the war they just fought to defend the colonies. The brits weren’t the good guys either obviously, but I think it’s a tad naive to think the colonists were the objectively good side. It’s just two groups of people fighting, there wasn’t a clearly good moral side like in WW2 or the US civil war.

On the aggressively pro-life side, I fear that the woman is likely to carry a baby to term while risking her own health, which would leave me as a grieving single father; OR she'd carry a baby with a genetic defect to term instead of terminating and I personally can't handle the idea of having a severely disabled child, but I'm not the type to run off, so I'd spend the rest of my life taking care of a disabled child I don't want and being miserable.

I've come to the conclusion that with the technology of today, it is much easier for teens and young adults to shut themselves in, and only interact via social media and text messaging. This is all before the pandemic, so I won't use that as a factor. My theory is that these people who shut themselves in and don't interact in person as people did before the internet was a thing, greatly deprive themselves of building the social skills needed to cope with stress. The stress that comes from problem solving in person scenarios that can happen on a whim. These people aren't able to just close out their Facebook, or not respond to a text message, thereby ceasing interaction. They have to respond in real time, and only in the face to face encounters will developing children, adolescents, and young adults learn to cope with events that may be unfavorable to them.

I believe the internet has played a huge part in the rise of mental illness, giving those who are still mentally developing a way out when things get too tough for them.

SilverHillz,unpopularopinion,1620642601.0,"Excessive violence and torture in film is boring, unnecessary, and adds nothing useful to the experience.","I have never seen a movie or show where excessive gore or torture scenes added anything whatsoever to my experience of watching it. Even “shock value” moments don’t hold any shock anymore for me because they’re so common. I just find myself going “oh, the guy is begging for his life. I guess the bad guy’s gonna shoot him now,” and then he does. Okay. Yes, the bad guy is very brutal. Good job writers, his personality is that he likes hurting people. Just like every single other one-note bad guy in every single other movie and show. Very original! Can’t wait to see our hero defeat him or whatever. Yawn.


Writing your villain as “guy who likes to hurt people—see? Here he is being super violent!” is lazy as hell. If you’re going to write a villain, make them interesting. Let them play psychological games with people or something. Give them a beating heart, not just a thirst for evil. It sucks to be so desensitized, but physical violence is frankly boring and uninteresting to watch. It’s 2021 and the world deserves cooler villains."

For those who don’t know, the Expanded Universe was al the novels, comics, video games, cartoons, and made for TV-movies released between 1977 and 2014 made up the Star Wars Expanded Universe, in April 2014 Disney said that was all non-canonical (except the Clone Wars, that still canon) and this outraged the fans. But I think what Disney did was necessary.

Fans of the EU often say that if Disney was more creative they could have made a sequel trilogy within the boundaries set by the EU, but it would have made the trilogy even worse. The EU went up to at least ~130 years after Return of the Jedi and they basically told the entire life story of Luke Skywalker. If Disney made a trilogy set within the EU they would have almost no creative freedom and could only tell a small scale story because, again the EU basically told tons of story in every time period. The EU even bright the Emperor back to life I a trilogy for comics, if Disney made a movie set in the EU it would have to be so small as to create plot holes."

CynicalDemon33,unpopularopinion,1620509027.0,YouTube needs a competitor,"I feel like YouTube needs a competitor. I know that Vimeo and Dailymotion exist but these are barely used compared to YouTube.

Lately, I feel like YouTube has gotten kind of stale and 'complacent' as a video-streaming platform. I still use YouTube and have a lot of channels I enjoy watching, but overall, I think YouTube is getting kind of boring and unoriginal.

I think YouTube needs a bigger rival/competitor because then that would push them (and maybe even force them) to improve their company more, improve their features, and be less complacent overall.

For example, Netflix has its competitors (Amazon Prime, Hulu), which push them to do better and improve as a company. KFC has its competitors (Popeyes, Chick-fil-A), which push them to do better and improve as a company.

But, I don't think YouTube has ever really had any major competitors (except maybe during the first few years when they started out), and due to YouTube's severe lack of competitors, I think they don't have any big incentives to improve as a company, and thus are becoming more complacent in their features and design."
KindOfScruffy,unpopularopinion,1620640816.0,Being 'so desperate' to go away on holiday because you haven't had one for a year is extremely dramatic and very priviledged.,"Since lockdown restrictions are lifting slowly here in the UK. I'm sick to death hearing about people saying that they genuinely feel 'depressed' or 'can't carry on' without going on holiday. All because they didn't get to go to an all-inclusive trip to Spain for a week.

Just because you can't go abroad or holiday parks, doesn't mean you can't enjoy the time off. Thats what annual leave in work is all about, booking time off to decompress and recharge your batteries. If you physically cannot do that without spending a good £1000+ to go away for a week. I don't believe you. You're just not trying to relax.

I know its a little different when you have kids and its a time for everybody to have a change of scenery, but you can still do that in your own country, just go for a drive to anywhere new for the day. Drive to the coast, hills, countryside, mountains, forests, rivers etc... There's a lot of possibilities you can still do without the ""NEED"" to go abroad.

EDIT: Let me say this louder for people not getting it. I'm not resentful, jealous or whatever towards people that want to go on holidays, you do you. This is specifically about the annoying people who pipe on and on about how they are 'suffering' or 'desperate' to get away."

Someone is not a toxic person if they don’t text you back every 2 minutes. Likewise, someone is not a toxic person if they *ask* that you text them back every 2 minutes. Those are not toxic traits, those are preferences, and differences in personality.

That's completely fine.

Especially babies cause they can't help the way they are. They're quite literally helpless. You were a baby too. So what if they scream and cry? They're completely helpless, can't walk or talk or feed themselves. Wouldn't you freak out?

Even though little children can think a lot more, they're still young and developing. They really can't help it. Sure they can be a bit annoying, but still... I find it very immature to hate kids honestly.

But that's just my opinion

Note: There's nothing wrong with hating it when kids cry and scream. But to hate an actual child? Come on...

Note 2: The point in, You were baby once too is:

1. they'll grow up.

2.They can't help being a baby.

So I don't see why you would hate something for existing and being what it is.

Not trying to sound like r/iamverysmart haha but by like episode 2 I was convinced that >!Viltrumites were not benevolent and actually world conquerors<! . 

I feel like the show could’ve done a way better job of obscuring/building up to this, considering it was the major plot point for the first season. I love plot twist series/movies but if they’re done poorly it leaves a vacuum in the shows narrative as the viewer is just waiting for the characters to get up to speed for the entire programme.

All this is not to say I didn’t find the show entertaining, I’m a fan of the shows secondary themes (a protagonist that doesn’t curbstomp everyone he faces, robot’s kinship for monster girl, the more gritty side of super powered beings etc. - though as a sidenote I’ve seen a lot of parallels/comparisons drawn to “The Boys” which I think is leagues ahead of “Invincible” - but that’s perhaps another unpopular opinion haha.

TLDR: The main plot point for the first season of “Invincible” is underwhelming and over focused, devaluing what could’ve been a great show to just a good one."
andres991027,unpopularopinion,1620585329.0,It is unfair for organizations and developed countries to give crap to developing countries for exploiting their natural resources,"Most developed countries have gotten to the point that they are at by exploiting their natural resources to the point of almost complete depletion and with really bad effects to animals and plants that used to live their.

So in this era of sustainability I find it really ironic that many people, especially those of developed countries, give crap to developing countries for wanting to use their natural resources to the max. Some examples of this are Brazil and the deforestation of the Amazon forest. Projects like this will result in more jobs and a bigger influx of money to the country which is sorely needed. More sustainable projects are either too expensive or may require work that is too specialized to be as profitable. In my opinion it is a countries duty to prioritize the happiness and economic stability of its citizens over environmental issues. (I do think the environment is extremely important but I believe other issues take priority)

If developed countries and organizations really want to conserve natural areas they should be paying this countries some type of fee for not using their natural resources. This fee should be based on approximately how much money would have been obtained if the natural resources were exploited. Another alternative could be providing cheap and easy access to machinery and technology necessary for more sustainable yet profitable work. 

I am unsure if someone has said this already so sorry if someone has."
BlazeWolfEagle,unpopularopinion,1620552245.0,Honestly kinda hate GTA 5 at this point,"Just saw an article about how GTA 5 RP has taken over Just Chatting as the most popular category on Twitch, and a thought came up that I think I'm starting to hate GTA 5. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic game, as GTA games have become known to be, and it's definitely one of the best open-world sandboxes you can buy. 

But I honestly really hate GTA Online. As a game mode, everything about it is very strategically designed to get you to play a very specific way (get money for properties for more money for more missions that you can do). It's very much centered around the properties to buy, most of which are heavily unbalanced economy wise. This itself wouldn't be bad, the problem is that by function of sheer player counts a lot of the times, the only properties that matter are the really super expensive ones. GTA Online DOES have other missions and activities to do, but for the goddamn most part, it's just grinding missions to do the Doomsday Heist, one of the single most annoyingly long heists I've ever played. I could easily turn this into a rant about specific areas of GTA Online I dislike, but my more focused point is that GTA Online is boring in a way that feels intentionally designed so, as a fault of it's core gameplay loop of the economy. That's part of why they've made such a big effort in subsidizing in game stuff (1 mil used to take literal months to get as a new player, now you just get it for logging in if you have Amazon prime or PS plus). 

But a boring game is not something to rant about. My issue is that it's fucking GTA, meaning it literally can't be unpopular or die. And Rockstar fully knows that. People are still relentlessly hopeful for GTA 6, and that's honestly pretty good, but I personally have lost hope that GTA 6 is something Rockstar is seriously considering, and if they are, it will have entered development VERY recently. GTA 5 continues to make infinite money with zero effort and Rockstar knows that. That's why they're porting it to PS5. They don't see a reason to continue serious development of singleplayer titles or new titles, GTA 5 is the last GTA. And seeing this annoyingly boring game get infinitely more popular just serves to exemplify in my eyes a notorious bad practice in the media industry as a whole, and maybe even late-stage capitalism. In creative industries, the goal is not always to create the best thing to build up a reputation for making good things so that you sell more. A lot of the time the goal is simply to get to a point where you can make one infinitely sustainable thing that just generates money. 

I would argue this is the area a large amount of major franchises lie, which I realize is not at all a hot take. Everyone has memed on the endless assassin's Creed/call of duty sequels since like 2014, I get it. But still. Warzone is similar to GTA Online in this way, I'd argue. Warzone... Can't die. It's too big and too popular. Now, unlike GTA 5, Warzone is part of the battle royale trend and will probably eventually see it's insane popularity start to dwindle similar to PUBG Fortnite and Apex, but those games still pull huge numbers. And just like Rockstar, I think Activision knows that, which is why they made Warzone standalone. Just like GTA 5, no one actually wants to play Cold War or Modern Warfare, they just like Warzone, just like how Rockstar has neglected the singleplayer for so long that it's not worth playing again for most people. And also just like GTA 5, Warzone's devs do things that it's core players give feedback on that goes ignored. 

Anyway, sorry, rant over, I just wonder that if enough people felt the way I do, we'd have GTA 6 by now, and maybe we'd start to see more examples of ""evergreen"" games that still have significant active development, like Minecraft. 

Oh, and a little addendum, I have NOT played the Cayo Perico heist, I lost interest completely in it when they revealed that the area is only accessible WHILE you're doing the heist. I agree with NakeyJakey's video essay in that restriction is one of the major design flaws with Rockstar games. 

People have said that it's a really good heist, and I believe them, I just can't bring myself to do all the leadup it will inevitably require, like spending way too much money on buying the property or vehicle or whatever that even lets me start it, waiting through absurdly long queue times only to have someone leave and be forced to requeue, failing the mission over and over again for stupid reasons because matchmaking pairs you with bad players, potentially doing hours and hours of shitty ""drive here and do this then drive back for 10 minutes"" setup missions, and then finally being hugely disappointed when the payout is only like 1.6 mil (to be divided among, at minimum, 2 people) for something you wasted like 20 hours on."
MangoSouthern,unpopularopinion,1620645220.0,"Dogs dumped at Kill Shelters are there for a reason, and the average person should not adopt these dogs.","I think this is unpopular because anytime I’ve expressed this opinion I’ve been met with snide looks.

So, this isn’t me saying that these dogs *deserve* to die. It’s not even saying that they are lost causes that could never live with a normal person/family.

What I AM saying is that most dogs dropped off at a kill shelter as say a surrender are there because they had behavioral difficulties an average family couldn’t handle and didn’t think made the dog an easy to handle one or else they would have taken care to drop it off at a good shelter, OR the dog was taken from a bad family situation which created hardwired behavioral instabilities or problems the average family will not be equipped to handle; Or they were picked off the street and aren’t socialized at all in which case someone trained to socialize strays needs to work with it.

Basically unless someone is just a cruel and heartless bastard you’re getting a reject of some sort. These rejects could be made into proper dogs with proper training and socialization but this is about the average family and the average family as far as I can tell isn’t willing to put this work in. If you’re not a trainer or are not willing to put time in with a trainer it’s best to stay away from shelter dogs. Of course there are unicorns or very young puppies simply born on the streets but 98% of these dogs in these shelters should be avoided.

Go for a no kill non profit because they have something of a vetting process and you can bet with a higher degree of certainty that you are getting a dog that is worth a damn and could live a normal family life."

DrunkHemplar,unpopularopinion,1620636810.0,Psychopaths are the WORST and need to be either eradicated or permanently quarantined,"I know this is an EXTREME opinion but hear me out; Psychopaths are basically the worst thing to ever happen to planet Earth.

Let me list the crimes committed by psychopaths to varying degrees.

* Cigarettes being harmful to people but studies being buried
* Salem Witch Trials
* Spanish Inquisition
* Multiple crusades
* Fossil Fuels fucking the world over
* Corruption of the Vatican **MULTIPLE TIMES** over the centuries
* Genocide from so many evil-ass humans it would be hard to justify naming one over another.
* Denial of climate change by people who know WTF they're talking about
* Fixing the price of medicine
* Fixing the price of basic food items such as bread and water

I can keep going...the list is unending...

Basically psychopaths, active ones are the WORST thing to happen to humanity as a whole and these people need to either be executed or quarantined permanently so they can't hurt anyone else.

Now, psychopaths who decide to not hurt others, especially on a mass scale are OK. If they just don't feel things, provided they don't hurt others- fine! But the moment they cross that line they become an existential threat to humanity they need to be removed from humanity in whatever method is efficient.

Now who decides who is and isn't a psychopath is another argument - one that is susceptible to extreme problems but ultimately; would the world be better off or worse off if psychopaths were just shipped off to Antarctica; the world's newest penal colony or outright executed; depending on their crimes? I think so.

I think people who don't give any shits about who they hurt in their pursuit of whatever they peruse with no remorse in a realistic situation are not fit for life; they are an extreme threat and have already caused extreme damage to society as a whole.

With the mass execution or extradition of these people; they may not develop empathy but they would reign in their worst behavior as the only person a psychopath cares about is themselves. It would be in their best interest not to be evil bastards at the expense of everyone else, especially when lives are on the line.

Now, do I believe this is a policy that could ever be implemented? No. There's so many issues with this that boil down to 'subjectiveness' that this is a nightmare of an opinion logistically but if we could magically bypass those issues and make sure that active psychopaths were the only people who get bopped with death or exile to Antarctica; I think the world would be much, much better off as a race.

Evil exists and it doesn't care if you believe in it or not. The only thing evil cares about is itself."

Most of the time I read this online it's either that they did and the person doesn't remember, that they did in a slightly different format and the person is too dumb to realise (i.e. ""They didn't teach us how to do taxes"", open an algebra book, please), or that there was no need to teach that in school. 

> ""When am I ever going to need that?"" 

Everything taught up untill highschool is so elementary that just knowing it for the sake of knowing it is reason enough to learn about it. Plus even if you won't use it on a daily basis, what is the alternative, making people choose majors when they're 15? Often times these are the same people that complain they have to choose majors at 18.

First of all no you can't. Plus even if you could there is nothing that can replace an academic setting and teacher, not yet at least.

but then i feel in the same breath, don’t condemn or shame people who chose to bleach their skin? after all, there are lighter skinned people of every race so even the whole “you don’t want to be [insert race here] and that’s why you bleached” isn’t really a good argument 

and even with the whole “bleaching your skin can cause x diseases” i mean yeah, cosmetic surgery can also be botched and risk lives  frequently in fact 

idk just something i feel relatively passionate about i guess. because ultimately the reason why people surgically or procedurally change their appearance for aesthetic or cosmetic reasons is generally based in Oppressive Beauty Standards, so why do we condemn some but not others?"
genius-swan,unpopularopinion,1620481239.0,It's gross and extremely rude when people over-share their medical problems unsolicited.,"I don't know if this has always been a thing but I know too many folks who wear their medical history like a badge of honor and flaunt it in casual conversation without realizing how rapidly they are ending said conversation. 

And i'm not talking about cancer survivors or disabled folks, I'm specifically referring to people who feel the need to over-share minor medical concerns that don't affect anyone else whatsoever. Popular topics include:

- Allergies and food intolerances (yes I need to know if I am cooking but I do not need to know the specifics of how bad your diarrhea gets when you eat strawberries)

- That ""mysterious illness"" you were hospitalized for 12 years ago. Don't care. 

- Diet and weight loss. Keep it to yourself. You never know who is struggling with an eating disorder. 

- Anything gastrointestinal tbh. Just saying ""I have IBS"" is more than enough. 

- Pregnancy, childbirth, breast-feeding. Just because I am a woman doesn't mean I care about your vaginal tearing or cradle cap on your nipples, Barbara. Keep that to yourself. Again you don't know who is having trouble conceiving and also, it's gross and personal. 

- Whatever you diagnosed yourself with on the internet. No I won't endorse your self-diagnosis. See a doctor. 

- Whatever you diagnosed your CHILD with on the internet. See above.

- Side effects from a common drug or preventative. I'm referring to something specific that we are all getting right now. Yes Tom, you and millions of people got a headache and fever after. You'll be okay.

- Any childhood injury or surgery or illness. Cool, I don't care. 

If it isn't directly relevant to the situation or conversation, or if no one asked, keep it to yourself. It's rude and can make people feel uncomfortable or even sick."

PurpleGodandViolet,unpopularopinion,1620539910.0,Unnecessary positivity is some of the most annoying behavior out there.,"Sure being positive is fine.

 ""You can do it""

""Youre beautiful""

""That's the best I've ever seen""

This is nice and all but like most other things in the world there is a place and time for it. If someone is trying to get over a mistake they made aggressive positivity can really be harmful and push them deeper in to their problem.

 It can also make people develop complexes about having to always be positive which can manifest in to mental instabilities. 

People also use it as an excuse to not deal with problems. Instead of arguing and discussing a situation they dismiss it because they don't or can't deal with a fight or being wrong leaving the problem unsolved and the dismissal that is fluffed up with a ""kind"" comment just adds fuel to the fire.

I mean seriously people grow up, read the room, accept that life sucks sometimes, let people fail and be sad for a while. Stop with the unwelcome and often times hostile positivity."
EdwardBliss,unpopularopinion,1620506327.0,Tawny Kitaen's was symbolic of what music is sorely lacking right now,"Tawny Kitaen, the star of the Whitesnake videos, sadly passed away. This hits me just as hard as an Eddie Van Halen or Neil Peart. She represented a certain time in music---in culture---that we're sorely lacking right now. Decadence, danger, controversy, irreverence, sexuality, authenticity. Good times. Sleazy times. Fun times.

Music has become complacent. Sanitized. Watered down. Predictable. Corporate sponsored pop and rap has dominated our culture for so long. Most people now would argue we have all those ideals I mentioned above. Sorry, a commercial pop artists version of ""danger, controversy, and sexuality"" is a little different than what it was for hard rock bands in the mid to late 80s. They're all pansies now.

It's time for a change. Something different. A reset. It would be nice if rock and roll was central to our culture again when this shitty pandemic is over."

It could be a cultural thing - I've lived in Ireland for most of my life and most of these viral videos tend to come from the US or the UK, where it seems a larger population will just produce a larger amount of potential Karen videos. I understand some people can just be outright unpleasant and hate everything and still be mentally sound but I think most of these Karen videos are showing more people in the world need help with mental health problems than ever before.

It is an terrible trilogy, the first book started out interesting and grasped my attention but near the middle it got boring extremely quickly, like seriously? ""Oh no kiss me peeta we must lIiIiiVe!"" The second book was ok but i feel like it was just pushing the line on the GALE OR PEETA line like JEEZ KATNISS JUST CHOOSE ONE it aint that hard. And the last novel was rushed and ended on a bad note. Katniss made me want to slap her in the face throughout the books like 1000 times. Peeta was always portrayed as a weak defenseless lover boy until he lost his mind and katniss tried to get him back. Katniss barely changed near the end of the series and had little  character development. Overall, sorry hunger game fans but the series is just not for me, half of the series is about a fake then real then fake then real love story between two characters while there's a frickin' war going on. Snow was an interesting character along with all the characters but katniss and peeta."
WitheredBarry,unpopularopinion,1620543873.0,"I feel part of the reason that the male exit rate is so high is because when a man makes a mistake, like hitting a woman, it is far more likely to haunt him for the rest of his life.","Exit = S-word

I think it's safe to say that society is more apt to forgive women over time than men, especially [according to criminal sentencing data. ](https://journalistsresource.org/criminal-justice/courts-lenient-sentencing-bond-women/#:~:text=Scholars%20have%20found%20that%20women,women%20shorter%20sentences%20than%20men.) 

If a woman hits a man, it's usually not treated as a big deal. Sometimes it's not even acknowledged, or even celebrated, as seen in the Heard-Depp debacle. 

However, if a man hits a woman, everyone who knows about it ends up holding onto that event for the rest of that man's life. The circumstances and actual level of violence don't matter. For example, my ex and I were shopping and a customer in front of us was being belligerent to the cashier. My ex shushed me and tugged on my arm to be quiet when I was about to confront the person. I gave her a *light*, hidden jab in the side, as a silent implication to please stop shushing me. According to her, it was a harder hit than I thought it was. 

The point is, no matter how well I explain the situation, apologize, admit responsibility, or reference the amount of therapy I've had since then, I'm still an abuser to anyone who knows about it. 

Similarly, I've had a former sexual partner spread rumors about me that have tarnished my reputation with a lot of people. It's like I can't escape any negative accusations and it's driving me insane. I don't want to lose any more friend groups. So now I hide everything, share nothing, and trust nobody... and surprise, I wanted exit too, at one point hospitalized. 

I feel like society doesn't give men a chance to grow or redeem themselves, and so they end up trapped in a cycle of depression and hopelessness. People make mistakes, but men seemed to be judged a lot harder for theirs."

aStrangeCaseofMoral,unpopularopinion,1620602211.0,It's the wrong people having less children,"This will definitely sound like a douchy thing to say, but honestly it's true. Overpopulation is a massive problem, both regarding environment, as well as socially, nonetheless it isn't coming from French, Germans, Dutch, Italians... While these are the ones choosing to reproduce less while being able to provide with more stability to most children they decide to bear.

Overpopulation is coming from countries that will exploit children, leave them to starve and unfortunately even die, while promising them that if they migrate life will become better. These children could've been spared of all the suffering were these the countries to reproduce according to their own means.

Let's face it, overpopulation is the biggest humanitarian problem worldwide, but the discourse is hitting the wrong people (although obviously no one should be striving to hit the 10 kid mark in these countries either)."

I've spent over a decade using the platform and watch dozens of hours of content weekly. However I don't use the YouTube home page or recommended videos. I'm very specific about how I curate my subscription feed and keep it to less than 100 channels at any given time. I have hobbies and interests and find specific channels about them. I'll find out about other quality channels either through searches or hearing about them. Even the generally higher quality channels I follow have started experimenting with the shorts format. This sounds fine until you realize that's a lot more videos spamming your subscription feed. I use a browser addon to hide videos I've already seen. Now I've even gone as far as finding way to filter out the shorts completely. I'm not going to claim all of them are bad, obviously I've seen some great ones. However in general I feel as though if something is worth seeing or finding out about it's worth going into more detail in a full length 8-10+, sometimes 20+ minute video."

Equivalent_Judge_307,unpopularopinion,1620463285.0,It's perfectly normal to let sexual history weigh in when choosing a partner,"I know this is, especially on reddit, very unpopular but hear me out. This post is in no way about slut shaming or hate towards people with a large or small body count. I'm talking about the choice of a partner, which is a pretty important decision in someone's life. Excluding people from that choice is no insult to those people in any way. 

What I'm saying is it's very normal to have a preference for someone with a small, or in some cases large body count. This can have various pwrsonal reasons, but for me it's about the view on sex, which I think is important to be on the same page with. Someone with 10 times my body count probably isn't on the same page as me when it comes to this topic. Selection on this is very normal and I know that a large percentage of the guys(can't tell for girls?) take it in consideration. This doesn't mean it HAS to be a deal breaker for everyone of course, but there is defenitely a preference for many people. 

These days it's normal to have a preference for haircolor, length, criminal history, how athletic someone is, age, job etc etc. But when you have a preference in terms of sexual history, you're suddenly called a slut shamer and a hater. Many of those things aren't even based on someone's choices, like hair color, while body count is purely based on choices. And someone's choices tell you more than the genetic color of one's hair. 

Also, I think gender in this matter is no point, it works both ways obviously."

Recently I came to a strong realisation: we humans can only love those who are willing to live.

When someone gives up on living (aka depression) we just stay by their side if we expect them to recover. Once we conclude that person can't be saved, we walk away from them. That is, unless we are forced to stay by their side by moral, social or legal circumstances; in that cases we stay, but facing it as a burden.

I gave up on living a long time ago, but I wouldn't say I'm depressed. My life is pretty ok, I'm just really not interested. And the idea of suiciding doesn't attract me. So I guess I'm halfway. I do the bare minimum just so I maintain my material conditions and then distract myself, waiting for my end to naturally come.

But it would be nice to have some company, y'know? I do have nice friends and family, but they're all busy... well... living. I wish I could have someone to live this no-life with me.

But as I said before, no one is able to love someone who gave up. So I guess I'll have to pretend I didn't. Or accept my lonely fate instead."

NationalPersimmon878,lonely,1619838748.0,I am at the worst pint in my life. Idk what to do anymore.,"This feels really awkward and embarrassing but I feel so shitty. I’m going to just rant about how I feel and my life even if no one sees because I need to. 
I am a 16 year old girl and I am a junior I’m high school. I am usually one of the best in my classes and I always got my work done. I have always worried about school and I have always gotten straight As. I currently still have straight As but I have really been struggling mentally and I have never felt this way before. 
I have repeatedly had depersonalization and derealization around 4 or 5 times in my life. It is honestly the worst thing to experience. (I feel like I am just watching my life through my own eyes but it doesn’t feel like me. I feel detached from everything.) it’s terrifying and I am pretty sureI have anxiety (I don’t want to self diagnose) which when my anxiety heightens enough I get depersonalization and derealization. Well lately, I feel isolated and lonely. My depersonalization, derealization, and anxiety has taken over my whole life. Even when I did get this in the past, I could always bounce back and continue with all of my responsibilities. Although it has never lasted this long (it’s only been around a month, which is not too bad) but in the first two weeks, everyday was a constant battle to fight my depersonalization and derealization by being going outdoors, reading, hanging out with family, etc. (Although it is extremely difficult to hang out with family because of my mental block to talk due to my dp and dr. So friends is out of the picture.) I was still getting work done, and I still was until right now. Although the last two weeks I have lost motivation for life and just stayed in my room and watched anime all day long. I did not realize the extremities of this until a few days ago, I realized that I wake up, watch anime, log into my online classes, and then watch anime and eat for the rest of my entire day. It’s so shitty and I barely realized that I sit for literally 10-12 hours without moving watching anime because I have nothing better to do, no motivation for life, no more motivation to do better or get better. I don’t really have any goals, and I never really knew my purpose in life. 
All that being said, I have already told my dad about my depersonalization, and he said that he will look into therapy for me (which I am excited for, I think that it will benefit me a lot, although I am scared to open up to someone). I don’t know what this feeling of not caring is. Idek what life is tbh lmao, I started to think that life you just do what makes you happy, and that enabled me to think that I could sit alone all day and watch anime bc that makes me happy. But i think it causes anxiety, because my dp and dr started to get better last week, I started to feel better, and now it is coming back. I am scared again. 
There’s a lot more that I could explain about my background that would explain a lot of my self doubt although this has been long enough and I am surprised if anyone will read it. 
But if they do thank you. I don’t know what to do. Tomorrow I will try to unplug but I have attempted that multiple times and it becomes a repeating cycle of trying to get my life back every day. 
I do think that staying indoors has negatively affected me as well, I am always in my room and lost all social skills (even though i already lacked them). I have gotten far more insecure and don’t want to even be seen by family anymore 

Thank you"

Magoush,lonely,1620098611.0,I’ve been thinking about how my fucked up genes led me to become a failure. I want to share what happened in my life up till now (18),"Growing up I was just an ordinary kid but was born with Ventricular septum defect (VSD) which has made me physically very weak and led to my parents being overprotective. I moved to the USA in 2011. I got my surgery. I was an ordinary kid. When I got to middle school I reached puberty and my face became uglier and I got fat and started getting bullied. For 3 years from 6th to 8th grade, I didn’t have a single friend and the bullying permanently damaged me. When I got to high school I was afraid of talking to people thinking I might get them mad at me or that I might do something wrong. I was afraid to try anything. I was a loner my freshman year. All I did was watch YouTube all day. I remember my family being pissed at me for being a loner and antisocial all day and compared me to family members my age. Made me feel worse but I wanted to break out of my shell. I joined track but once again the bullying returned because I sucked at running. I was always short and skinny. I was 5’5 and 100 lbs. I remember feeling I’ve had enough and wanted to become someone ppl will respect and admire. My dad really wanted me to go to an Ivy League and become a doctor. I was the youngest in my family, shit happened and my siblings never got the chance to go to college so I was the only one left. I thought that was my chance. I spent the entire junior year of high school studying for the sat and looking to boost my application. I retook the sat 4 times and still got a lower score than some kids taking it once without studying. I took the subject tests and was so burnt out I scored bottom 10%. I thought if I could get a good SAT score ppl in my school and my family wouldn’t see me as a loser. Ofc I ended up just applying to a state university. I wanted to experience social life before I graduated so I tried so hard to get invited to parties but ppl just didn’t want me. My school was very sports focused and I didn’t really fit into any group and it was too late. Even the nerds didn’t want me. I ended up just staying home all day and watching YouTube videos like before until pandemic hit and graduation was socially distanced. I didn’t even wanna go to graduation. Now here I am done with first year of university. Ppl say first year is the best but I lived with my parents and online classes so I didn’t even get the first year experience and made 0 friends. I don’t even know what I will become in the future. I tried to improve my self in every way but I’m just shit at everything and stuck with my ducked up genes. Sometimes I wish I could swap places with someone from my country of origin because I don’t deserve this opportunity in life. I don’t know if anyone is still reading this but those of you who think ur a failure just know that ur not the only one"

Ihats1,lonely,1620091542.0,I Still can't get over her...,"It's been about 8 months, i don't know if its even her, or the feeling of being that close to someone emotionally. 

Ever since then its been a culmination of things, my 2 extremely close friends getting jobs which with school has made it impossible to hangout with them. The other friends I have are good and they are friends, I just don't feel the same hanging out with them anymore as well.

In the beginning stages of quarantine I at least had an outlet sort of. I had discovered staying up till 3 in the morning and was using it to break down for hours on end. But with 3 days of breaking down at night and crying, I would have 1 extremely good day where I would feel amazing.                                            Now I can't even cry, no matter how hard I try. At best I just feel despair and regret in my chest. One night I drank a Bang and it made me feel horrible, I wanted to cry in the shower like the pitiful husk I have become but I ended up just standing and staring into the wall. The warm effect from the water did little to make me feel better. 

I have no motivation now, my grades are kept good just because I know Its something i should probably do but i have no will to do so. I don't want to go to college or anything, i would rather Work a retail job and live in a 1 bedroom apartment sleeping in my free time. Because that's just how bland my life has become. I can't smell either so the world seems even more grey (deviated Septum, not corona related).  

I lay in bed at night, thinking if my future will be lonely forever. Corona has sucked adding to this. Majority of people stay home at school or just don't go out that much so its been very hard just finding more friends over the course of this year. Honestly i don't know if it will get better. It's puzzling, I've never felt anything like it before, the true void of nothingness.

Since I got so many messages, I will have some criteria that help me save more time instead of replying to all:

1. I prefer if you are American because I am fascinated with your culture (but this is just a small preference)
2. You are serious
3. You are fun loving and laugh a lot/like making others laugh :)
4. You dont care much about money
5. You like to forgive.

If this looks like you, please send me a message!!!!!!! I prefer long introductions because that means you r serious! I will find someone one last time then just focus on that person.

And if we talk well, maybe....OK, lets talk about this later!"
Jonkk_,lonely,1620289353.0,I miss my old friend. Why does the healing process feel like an emotional rollercoaster,"I recently had a falling out with someone I considered my best friend. He cut me off entirely without any real explanation. Its been tough tbh. For self care and acceptance, I had deleted our photos together and old conversation threads so I don’t go back to the sadness and initially if felt amazing. I was motivated and glad to accept that we weren’t in each others lives anymore. 
But recently I’ve been missing him a lot lately. I find myself checking their socials every few hours (though I’m blocked on some). It sucks that one day im perfectly happy moving on with life but then some days I just wish things never ended. 
I don’t really have much people to vent to about this situation and I really have so much to get off my chest. he was my friend that I could chat to. 
I want to add that when we were friends he helped me out with getting started at the gym. We motivated each other and he really helped me get the ball rolling with my gym progress. Now that he’s gone, i still go to the gym but I don’t have anyone to celebrate with when I hit new goals or am happy with my progress. No one to hype me up or push me further. It’s also my birthday coming up in a week and I’m kind of dreading the feeling of not having someone to wish me a happy birthday.
I just keep remembering the last time I dropped him off home not knowing that was the last time I’d see him. 😔😔😔"

Enviroscidancesing,lonely,1620158069.0,"Tears running down my face, Im so scared of loneliness","I write this as I have tears running down my face, alone in my bedroom, laying in bed, trying to fall asleep so this day ends quicker

Im so scared of loneliness. For almost 6 years I talked to my ex boyfriend every single day, we talked about everything and shared even the littlest of things. We broke up more than a year ago, and since then its been difficult to adapt not talking to someone every day. I know this might seem bratty of me to say, but I cant seem to cope not having someone to share my day with.

I want to be able to find someone who is excited to talk to me, who wants to share with me, someone that always has me on their mind. Someone that can love me unconditionally. This makes me seem so needy... I acknowledge that immensely and I cant seem to shake it off

I wake up, go to work, come back home, work out, have dinner, take a shower, and go to bed, all while constantly checking my phone to see if someone has messaged me back. I recently moved to a new country and with the pandemic its been very hard to socialize. 

I want to be someone’s favourite person, and I want that someone to be mine"
BattleRadiant,lonely,1620334991.0,"""A relationship won't make you happy"" is the basically the same as ""money can't buy happiness""","Everyone has heard these basic platitudes, and of course they are true to an extent. There are a lot of people in dead bedroom/lonely relationships, as well as people who have climbed the corporate ladder and are left unfulfilled. However, a complete lack of romantic relationship experience or financial stability is almost a guaranteed way to mental anguish.

There is clear evidence that earning more money does increase your happiness, up to a certain point. Once you can comfortably cover your living expenses and some luxuries, adding additional income won't add much to your overall happiness. Likewise, being broke and struggling to even make ends meet adds a significant amount of stress and anxiety to peoples' lives. 

I  would argue that relationships are very similar. Having very little to no dating/relationship experience, despite desiring it, is almost a guaranteed way to depression and stress. Just look at the Foreveralone and Incel groups; depression and suicidal ideation are common in nearly every post. There are some people who can live fulfilling lives without a relationship, but it is definitely not the norm."

throwaway1234719,lonely,1620360731.0,Everyone in my life but me.,"My intense feelings of loneliness stem mostly from my inability to get into a romantic relationship. 
I know I know it’s not everything and I shouldn’t base my self worth on it, but when you spend all 24 years of your life trying to find that kind of connection and only being met with rejection, it hurts. 

I do have a couple of friends I consider close. I met them way back in school and have managed to hold onto them despite my tendency to fuck up everything I touch. 

We were all single, and I took a weird comfort in that. It helped to have people in my life that struggled the same way I was. We would always complain to each other in that dumb meme-y “hell yeah brother gonna die alone 👉😎👉” sort of way. Maybe it wasn’t the healthiest way to deal, but it helped. 

Over the course of the last month or so, they’ve all managed to get into a relationship. Everyone but me. And it makes me feel like a terrible person because I wish I was happier for them, but I can’t help but feel jealous. And now whenever I try to talk to them about feeling hopeless in finding a relationship, even if I’m reaching out to them in earnest, they’ve started hitting me with the usual “hey don’t worry there’s someone out there it’ll happen when it’s meant to happen :)” bullshit. I get angry at them cause we used to jokingly say that to each other since we all knew how fake it was. But now that they’ve actually got somebody they think it’s suddenly legit advice. So now I just get to silently watch from the sidelines as my closest friends get to experience something I never will, while they treat me like every other “relationship expert” does. 

TL;DR all my friends suddenly got into relationships and now I’m even more alone than ever."

So anything people say about me being too young to worry or think about this stuff ain't making me feel better. Too many people have told me that and I'm stubborn. Feels like I've lived 30 years with how slow time is crawling. I can't go a single night without thinking about my exes. I can't go a single night without getting a reminder of how lonely I really am. Everyone keeps telling me it'll get better, BUT IT SURE AS HELL DOESN'T FUCKING FEEL THAT WAY. Then there's that one side of me who just wonders if I should be feeling this way, cause obviously people got it worse, at least I got a family, at least I got shelter, food, etc. I don't know if should throw my feelings away, in that case. I can't stand it. If life was a person, I'd punch it repeatedly. And very hard. Like I said, if it gets better it certainly doesn't feel that way. I'm trying to stay positive and tell myself that it won't be a bad ride all the way, but I don't know what to do anymore. Can't go one day without thinking how the people in my life have someone. But me? No one. At least no one to have a loving bond with. I'm starting to sound like a bitch, but I can't hold it all in for too long. Don't get me started on people who give you advice, but they themselves are in a relationship. Ah yes, I'm totally going to heed what they say about how it's good to be lonely or how they were in a dark spot just like me. Well good for you, because at least you don't feel alone anymore. I might have brought up the worst possible excuse, I don't know, but I can't stop thinking about it. Yeah, I distract myself with other things, but it's not gonna make the feeling go away. I've done so much shit and it makes me wonder if I even deserve one in the end. Complaining about it only adds to that theory. I think I'm incapable of loving someone in that way. I used to want to not feel shit, because at least I wouldn't feel all the bad. And now, I regret it. Surprise surprise. Maybe I don't deserve to be with someone after all. Then I'm only 16. It's gets better from here, right? I don't have to go the next 40 fucking years by myself, right?!?! I'm probably exaggerating, huh? If you read through all of this, then thanks. And no, I don't get mad at a chick for not liking me. What's the point of going through this anymore? Most nights I feel horrible.

I deal with so much disrespect through out my day and I have no one to turn to.  

The only “peace”  I have is the imaginary scenarios I make up in my head where I am liked, wanted, appreciated, successful. 
Or the stories I make up in my head, fictional people and their lives, I’m not involved in these stories. 

Do I give this up for my health? Or do I indulge in these made up worlds to break from the monotony. 

It’s getting sad. I have a playlist for these “people”"

There are over 210,000 users on this subreddit and the weirdest part is that we all feel so alone despite the fact we're not alone. The Internet is supposed to bring people together but it's it's done is highlighted how isolated we are.

Dismal-Bowler6987,lonely,1620602885.0,Why am I so unlikeable,"

Why am I always the lonely one, the one who is left out. Why do people not like me, am I just unlikeable or something? It’s like how my friends get 50 messages from different people that who are their friends and they don’t even care while I’m over here getting none a day and only sometimes I get 1 and even then I get so happy but it’s normally something like someone asking for help with something or someone sending a random video. Why can’t I be liked like them. Why can’t I have loads of friends. Like when one on my friends doesn’t get invited he could just go to his other 100 friends and if my other friend didn’t get invited he could just go to his other 300 friends. Why the hell am I so unliked. Why the hell am I so lonely. I just wanna have as many friends as they do so I can start getting better at my social anxiety with more people and have somewhere or someone to go/play with because I have to wait for one of my closest friends to get on all day and Me and God knows that all the rest won’t talk/invite me any time soon. I just wanna be comfortable around people. Even when I meet their friends they pay no attention to me or just make fun of me. I just wanna be loved I wanna have someone to talk to about my problems but I don’t. I hate my life so much."

Take me for example, I'm a 24-year-old male and I only have 2 friends one of them is a genuine friend and the other is a casual friend (yes they know each other); so basically I only have one real friend but guess what my situation is not extraordinary because having only 1 or 2 real friends, especially as a male, is the norm."

Have you used to beeing lonely? Used to nobody texting you? Used to nobody to have fun with/Nobody that wants to have fun with you? Nobody that loves you even tho you love her/him? Nobody caring about you having mental problems? etc. etc.

Were all humans - A human can get used to everything/nearly everything. But after all this time I haven't gotten used to my life beeing like that. It still hurts my soul (if there is anything left like that inside me) and I still ask myself questions like ""why me?"".

Like literary no one. The whole day I just sit in my room doing nothing. I watch some videos on the internet and that's it. This has been going on for 5 years now. The whole day I don't talk to anyone. I have never been in a relationship always wanted to but never had the courage to speak up. I always isolate myself. I am so afraid to talk to people especially in groups. I hate myself more than anyone. I can't look myself in the mirror anymore. I think I deserve this. This world is not a place for someone who is so afraid and has no ambition. I want to give up. It's so painful. It's just that I am afraid that there is nothing after life and after I die I will just stop existing. I just don't wanna feel pain anymore. 

Edit: I wanted to say thank you for everyone for talking to me and commenting on my post. Sorry I didn't reply to your comments. Got some messages too sorry again if I haven't replied to your messages. I actually hide some of the  chats thought I would talk later not realizing I can't get them back and don't remember the usernames. I was just having doubts of talking to everyone cause I have talked to some people here and after some time when they find out how depressed I am they leave. I feel more sad after that.  Don't feel bad if i didn't respond to your message. I am not that interesting to talk to. And thank you for taking time and commenting and talking to me. It means a lot to me. If you are going through the same thing or something alike you can always get better and try to be happy and have fun. Never give up and keep on fighting. It's going to be hard unbearable sometimes but just keep on fighting and moving forward.

Beginning_College292,lonely,1619896405.0,People generally dont like being around me,"Im a quiet person, socially anxious too, whenever a conversation presents itself im usually awkward but i genuinely try to respect people, but that is never reciprocated, people are nice to me from the start but then they start getting irritated by my presence for no reason,  their body language says it all, im annoying them in someway.
Is it that i have nothing to offer? How can i fix that? I was thinking that i have no deeper layer to me and that i am really boring which sucks, even my ex gf told me ""dont take this personal but nobody likes you"". This really sinks me into depression cuz ik its true, i have such a hard time making friends and establishing relationships with people, its my biggest insecurity, everybody knows me at school but nobody likes me, which is really sad, im the guy with no friends, and not even just school, outside too, at my work, public gatherings etc, im obviously the problem and im okay with that but i want to change.
That thing i mentioned of people getting irritated by my presence for no reason, yea i have that same feeling with my older brother whos also socially anxious, so im trying to be open minded and see why i feel that way about him, hes quiet too and such a fucking nice person, but maybe he falls into that ""boring"" category too cuz i get annoyed whenever im around him, even when hes not doing anything, i just want him away from me cuz im irritated, i obviously know how he feels now and im trying to redirect my feelings and try to incorporate them to help myself too, but how can i change?

Dismal_Orchid555,lonely,1620141914.0,I'm tired of titles ....read if you want to,"Today I ended up having a long conversation with this friend (let's call them F). I was expressing my concerns about some tests and my friend was not having it. F's attitude was why are you worrying? relax. what's the point now?. I expressed  in agreement that there was nothing I could do about it too  but her unwillingness to understand that sometimes concerns can linger was off-putting.  I told F that while she may not care, I did because it was my responsibility to. F called me out for being hostile and rude. She really dug into me and claimed that it was the main reason she was rarely inclined to just talk to me. My blunt and 'hostile' attitude was quite a turn off on multiple occasions whenever there was a difference in opinion. This wasn't the first time F has called me out for being rude. To add to that I'm too dull for her. Anyways....

 The whole point of narrating this is to admit that I may be passive aggressive sometimes. When I'm crucified for something that doesn't strike me as deeply rude/offensive I'm hurt but even more so since I've let myself become that way. This incident is important to me because I opened up to F  about a serious personal issue a year ago....something that my own family members have struggled to voice to those close to them. So F became really important to me from that point on. But now I feel regret and confusion. Everyone has baggage but maybe it's gotten to me. Maybe I have cracked a bit. But now I look at myself and wonder who would empathize with my attitude. I think back on those who are worse and have no control and let themselves run free with their aggression.....I think about if I'm one day going to become like them. Now I wonder if I would be able to empathize with them......because I too am asking for that type of empathy........

anyways I feel better articulating everything in this form....so that's one positive take away......I guess"

jimmieabes,lonely,1620120169.0,How to cope with being average?,"I’m gonna start with some narcissistic background, then go into some pity afterwards. I’m 27 years old, I have a 6-figure job, a waterfront home, a big lifted diesel truck, yada yada...I can sing, work with my hands, play piano/guitar, hunt/fish, haul trailers, and a bunch of other random things. My friends and family think highly of me, and people I meet always end up saying things along the lines of “I like you, you’re a cool dude.” All this being said, I know in my head that I have a lot to offer. The problem is, I’m 5’9” (average), maybe a 6/7 in looks (average), have the personality of a piece of cardboard in that I don’t really have a lot of cool hobbies, and introverted, and get overwhelmed in crowd settings unless I’m piss drunk. I only have 2 friends, both of whom have moved away for work recently.

I have 2 brothers who are better looking than me, one is taller in addition. But the 3 of us have all suffered being single our whole lives. Not one of we have said that we love anyone romantically - nothing has worked out for us yet. I haven’t had a relationship last more than maybe 2 months. I love being alone and I thrive this way, however I’ve always wanted to get married to someone I enjoy spending time with.

This, in my head, all boils down to the fact that I’m painfully average compared to the 6’5” Chads that girls are looking for nowadays. I don’t stand out that much physically, and that’s why I can’t get the girls that I actually want to be with. In the past, with the exception of one girl, I’ve always been left for someone taller.

I’ll take any encouragement I can get, because most people find someone eventually. But I also need some tough love because I want to live as objectively as possible. Does anyone have advice or words to offer?"

The thing is we’re best friends. Which might sound good, but she also has a bf currently. And if that wasn’t enough she had a two year long relationship with one of my closest guy friends before.

acgkt,lonely,1620484126.0,Feeling uninteresting,"This is pretty random, but I feel lonely most of the time, most of the day, have been for a few years now, and I have on and off depressive episodes.

I got only (1) online friend that I have met almost a year ago now on twitter. They don't really want a close friendship, which is what I crave. They care, I know they do, I do too, and they often try to be here as much as they can, but they need a lot of space, are scared of close bonds, and I am often frustrated and sad because I feel like I'm always the one trying to get to know them, which doesn't seem reciprocal.

And on top of that, I have attachment issues and fears that make meeting people and making friends very painful, panic inducing and confusing.

I don't want to be alone so that's why I try to still talk to them on the daily - but it feels very lonely, and they know I'm lonely with them, but they don't know what to do even if they wish they could, and I don't want to make them uncomfortable either.

What made think of this so I felt the need to write a post here - is how I have a ""public"" twitter account with them following me among other people, and they never interact with me. My private twitter where nobody even follows me feels less suffocating because at least I don't have expectations there, I can ramble, be sad, lonely and talk to myself there. I desperately wish I had someone who wants to talk to me, who likes sharing things with me, who wants to be close - but I don't and it hurts.

I just needed to get that out, I guess.
Take care people."

When I love it’s brutal and I become unhinged and I can’t deal with how it makes me feel like I’m going to die or I’m going crazy. It’s bad because I get tunnel vision and can’t focus on other people which is cold and uncaring. I don’t want to be this way. I want people who don’t even have the capacity to love me back. I know better but my emotions will overrun.

I'm stuck in this cycle of talking to people for a couple days and then they realise how fucking stupid I am and then ghost me. Then while I'm riding this high of talking to someone, I say something stupid in a group chat and it makes me want to.

It's not hyperbole, it has happened 4 times in a row now. It is clear the problem is not with the other people, there is something wrong with me.

Every time I talk to someone, it always starts with them being interested and fun and as the days go on, their 2-3 texts turns into 1 words replies. I just failed my maths exam and said something stupid in some group chat and someone has left me on delivered for 2 days. I just convince myself somehow that I have something interesting to offer or funny to say when I just fucking don't.

I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I've tried everything, let social media go for a week, let everything wind down and none of it fucking works. I have suicidal thoughts anyway and these do not make them easier. I don't know what to do anymore."

DecipheredEnigma,lonely,1619921547.0,I had to breakoff a friendship with a girl whom I had feelings for while she did not feel the same way. Here's the very last thing I said to her:,"This girl was the kindest person I've met and it's also the reason I feel it might be a trait of hers that holds her back in a way because she's too afraid to let people's feeling get hurt.

We developed a friendship and to keep the story short, I fell in love with her and she kind of picked up on that. I had never talked with her in depth about this but she gave me clear signs that she is not interested. Nothing wrong with that. I understood and we continued to have conversations, give each other advice, share big moments in our lives, check up on one another regarding our physical and mental health, things like that. However, I suppose these feelings never went away and over time they yet again started to interfere with our friendship.

Below is the very last thing I texted her. Please note that she has already responded to this and acknowledged my feelings but has again made it clear that this is something she does not want to pursue but wants to keep talking with me and be friends. She reserves the right to do so and I respect that decision but sadly I had to make the call to end it.

&#x200B;

>I think I'm in love with you. I just have these feelings for you that is hard for me to explain. I think about how kind hearted and smart and lovely you are and how I see beauty in that and it makes me find you attractive. I don't know why I feel like I should tell you but I wanted to be upfront about it to you and I feel guilty for having them because I don't want to have you think about me in the same way because I think you deserve better than me. I also want to keep you in my life because you mean so much to me and despite how late or early it is you always found a way to take the time to message me. You always ask how I am doing. You give me advice and you compliment me whenever you can. Those types of things make me have these love feelings for you. And if you don't want to talk to me about this or if you never want to hear from me again I don't blame you if you don't have the same feelings. You deserve the best of love and I'm afraid that I think I am not capable of giving you what you desire in a relationship. I don't know where to go from here but my intentions was to share these feelings and not try and take a friendship to the deep end. What I mean is I still want to be your friend but I feel ashamed and incredibly stupid for wanting it to be more than that.

I know this was the right thing to do. Her fear of hurting other people's feelings forced her to want to care about me, but it's been very apparent that she does not want me any more than as a friend (it's a lot I don't want to get into). This made me feel like I was holding her back and it seems like I can't hold back these feelings. So this was the best call to make and I stand by that."

PizzaBoy2086,lonely,1620614547.0,I am in pain,"I've been feeling pretty shitty for a while now. I would like to blame it all on the quarantine but if I'm being honest to myself and everyone else I've been feeling like crap ever since high school graduation three years ago. That night it sort of hit me that whatever goals and aspirations I had for my life were too lofty or too meaningless compared to the goals of all those people I saw walking across that stage to get their diploma. In high school, I was coerced into taking AP courses and AP tests because it was what my older sister had done when she was there, and of course she had done exceptionally well in all her courses whereas I, a supposedly smart AP student, had to get tutors for courses that everyone else in my class seemed to breeze through. I had my moments to shine in English and history courses, but I fell flat in all the rest even though my aim was to go into STEM after graduation. My hopes rested on that, that I would be able to breeze through the sciences to achieve my career goals. By the end of high school, those goals were out of reach, made so by my abysmal scores in those courses. I want to stress that I had planned out my whole life around those goals, and now I was utterly lost. 

I decided to follow my sister's route, apply for a scholarship to our local community college. I was rejected, probably because it was the first interview for a scholarship I had ever been in and was extremely nervous. She got a full ride while I got to work 30-35 hours a week at minimum wage at a Little Caesar's (the raises stopped at $8.25, by the way, would not recommend). But I powered through. I still had no plan for my future, but at least I had work and school to distract me from that rather large enigma. Of course, I fared no better in college than I did in high school, and I had to delay my graduation by a semester because I failed a Calculus course. But the final semesters were pretty okay, and I had some classes that I actually enjoyed. Y'know, until Covid reared its ugly head. Those few classes I did enjoy were snuffed out by switching to online course curriculum, which left the classes a shadow of what they once were, and I learned absolutely nothing from them for the rest of the semester. It was around this time that my dad began pestering me about the next step in my life; now that I had an Associate's, what was the plan? There was none, and for the rest of the summer last year I hemmed and hawed trying to come up with a new goal that would satisfy him. I kicked the can down the road saying that I would take a few more courses at the school to get some credits under my belt for a bachelor's degree, as my newly found career idea was to become a history teacher, the inspiration for which came from my sister of all places. He seemed satisfied with that answer but once those classes are over, I would need to apply to colleges and look for better job opportunities as my current job won't cover the cost of a single semester of any four-year school in our area, let alone room and board at one further away. 

That being said, I did hold for a long time a great joy in my life, that being my book. I had written about 70 pages of the book itself and maybe 30 or 40 more pages of stuff related to the book. Me being the goddamned idiot I am, I kept all of this on a USB stick which I lost this winter. I had poured almost five years of work into it, and now it's probably sitting in a landfill somewhere in midwestern PA. It has been hard to cope with and find the energy and tenacity required to rewrite all those pages. I might as well be putting in as much effort trying to remember what I'd written as if I were writing a dissertation. If there were one thing I'd have done in my life that was worthy of remembrance, it would have been my book. 

Such as it is, these things have weighed heavily on me for some time. Tonight was a particularly hard night. I am plagued constantly by my thoughts, and even among friends I feel ashamed and lonely. I try to convince myself that if only I had an S.O. that my porn addiction might wear off and that a relationship would satisfy most of the needs in my life. Sadly, they aren't so much ""needs"" as they are desires. I should be thankful and grateful not to be in the situations so much of the world faces. But my thanks and gratitude are nothing, they do not fill a void. I am consistently pressured by my family and my church to espouse our beliefs from the rooftops and to act Christian to those who don't return the favor to me. But if I am genuine to myself, I cannot put on a face or a front of patient loving kindness and mercy. I believe it, but I cannot bring myself to act it out, hypocrite that I am. I live in sin yet I profess the word of God. I stopped asking for forgiveness a long time ago, because I found myself returning to God every night to repent. In my mind, I justify it in that asking for forgiveness usually means you'll try to change your ways. I've tried, God knows I've tried hundreds of times. But I Just. Can't. Stop. So I stopped repenting. And my guilt is all the heavier for it. 

I'm very sorry to anyone who forced themselves to read to the end. I tend to ramble and carry on with these things forever. I very much wish there were a way to stop myself from explaining my whole life story, but I wanted to explain why I felt the way I did, what caused myself to be in my present predicament. I hope that anyone who reads this knows that I wish you well and I hope that you escape or conquer any feelings or predicaments that are weighing you down, whichever comes first."

BongyAh,lonely,1620214148.0,Ever felt...”Different” from other people?,"I’m wanna open my mind and also not feel so alone in this aspect, so feel free to drop what has sort of separated you from other people. I’m gonna be very vague and not delve into the specifics just a brief run down but I’ll start.

I have a very small, close group of friends that I handpicked from high school to keep as friends. However, as we graduated and began to develop our lives independently, I’ve realised I’m kind of the odd one out now. When we hang out and have discussions I realise...I’m nothing like these people around me. Their hobbies, their life philosophies, their beliefs, just them as people, I don’t really match up with at all. And so after a hang out or even during a hang out, I just sit and realise, “Wow, I’m just different from these people. Completely. Nothing like them, and cause of that I can never truly be apart of them.”I’ve noticed I’ve felt this way about a lot of groups or people I’m with. I feel so radically different from a majority of groups or people that this has made me feel alone. I like my time alone, it’s probably because I feel most comforted around myself but it’s started to make me feel lonely, and truth is, I’ve been a sort of “lone wolf” or “outsider” all through high school and the only reason I “hand picked” my group of friends was because they were the only ones at the time who made me feel not alone. That’s changed however. 

Anyways, I’m curious about the other “outsider” or “lone wolf” people out there. I know I’m not the only one ironically. What truly separates you from other people? Is it a mental or physical ailment? Different mindset or personality from normal? I wanna open my mind to how many “different” people there are and what kind of “different” there are."

Metalback72,lonely,1619882851.0,"21m, so tired. I don't want to exist but i don't want to hurt my family.","Little bit about myself. Im 21 yo male, been doing sports and martial arts since i remember myself. I was always the quiet kid but never been bullied and disliked and i believe its probably because of physical appearance and people knowing i can stand for myself if needed.

I just don't know what the problem is. I can't talk to people. Just can't. I'm always coming out as the cold/no feelings guy everywhere new i go. I had 1-2 people in my mandatory military service that i could trust and they're pretty much the only people that actually know me. But now that im discharged after 2.8 years im back to being completely alone. I found a job and already fucked every chance i had on finding friends (especially women. Many show interest but quickly realize there's something wrong with me).

My day to day life now goes like this:

Wake up 5:30am, work 7-4, lift weights when i get home 5-6pm, practice boxing in a gym 7-9pm.

I have big dreams. I want to be a champion and i truly believe i will achieve it. All those years of being alone got me working like crazy. I never quit in anything i start. Never. 

I just don't see how can i go through life living in misery inside my head. I feel like i go through everything on auto mode. Completely numb to everything. I'm just very tired..

I sometimes love to believe i was destined to be alone in order to develop the work ethic and discipline that i have and that it's a matter of time before i get everything i ever wanted. Thing is, i noticed that almost everything i want and desire eventually happens if i put my mind into it. The reason it's almost everything is because i never managed to make friends or get a girl by my side. 

There's those days when i feel unbeatable like im the best person ever. I work the hardest. I'm trying to help people with everything i have because i truly love it. Kinda fooling myself that everything is alright and maybe i can enjoy life completely by myself. And then the realization that im already 21 and haven't done anything in my life. Wasted my teenage years crying at home pretending everything is fine. Never had a friend. Never had a relationship. Touch starved. 

Thing is I'm the kind of guy who on the outside looks like i get it all easy. I've been told so many times that im good looking (from men and women, or women that told me their friend is interested). I'm very conscious about my appearance. It's important to me to always look good, be clean and smell good. When i tell people I've never been in a relationship they laugh like I'm joking with them. 

Never been handed nothing. Never asked for help with ANYTHING. Everything i have is earned with sweat and tears. It's the only reason i still have self respect. I know what I've been through to get to where i am.

I don't know how to continue from here."

luckyviolet13,lonely,1620269864.0,i wish we never met,"when i was 12, i met this boy online. we ended up getting really close, for a long time. after years, i found out he was a bit older than me. nobody had to know that though. when i found out that the person i fell hard in love with for the first time was actually not a boy, i was scared. but i told myself it was okay anyway, i really liked who i was talking to, and i understood why they may not feel comfortable in their skin. i get that. every day, we texted from sunrise to sunset, slept on skype, said goodbye into the webcam before i headed off to school. we'd be like, put the microphone on your mouth so i can hear you breathing. it felt like love. 


we planned our very first in person meeting when i was 15. she would fly from maryland to come see me, she'd rent a car, pick me up from home, and we'd spend the weekend in a hotel room. i was madly in love. she let me drive the rental truck. someone came all the way here to see me, how lucky am i. when my parents found out, the feds became involved.


shit hit the fan. it's been almost ten years, she's still in custody waiting to be deported. for so long i thought it was love. spent my savings on defending her. they added more time to her sentence when they found out we were still in communication. apparently we weren't supposed to talk. i had a burn phone from cricket. they had tapped phone lines. i hired a lawyer, dropped the no contact order. i couldn't quit her. 


we wrote letters back and forth, so many letters, confessing so much love, for so long. i'd fill the pages in my best words. i thought she was the one, that i'd move to another country to be with her. leave my family behind. this was all a mistake, i wasn't a victim. i wanted her. in the worst way.


piles of letters, filled with words i spent so much time swooning over. stamps, my name, so lovely written, sometimes with hearts decorating the envelope, sometimes with a scent i can never forget. she was proud of me and my accomplishments out here, she wasn't mad at me, she didn't hate me, it was her fault. she was doing well. she was becoming an electrician. in jail. you can do that. i know that because of her.


my heart broke when she told me that someone she had known during her stay got the letter ""R"" tattooed on their finger. that meant that someone else loved her in the way i loved her, all the while i thought her love was solely for me.


i've been depressed for almost ten years straight, bitch gave me ptsd, tried so many different meds, therapy, ketamine injections straight to the fucking vein, just trying to get her out of my head. lately, i see her in my sleep so vividly, doing so much better than me, and it hurts every time. to see her with other girls makes me so jealous in my dreams. i miss her in the worst way. i loved her something fierce."
DangerDaskov,lonely,1620355392.0,"""Join the military"", they said,"" you'll meet lots of people"", they said","The title is not wrong yes I did join the military. Was it the best decision? Maybe... could I have done better things in life than being all the way out here? No I couldn't this is my step towards a better life but right now I can't seem to see that. Right now I'm a young 19 year old with a bright career and a broken heart. In less than 10 days I'm supposed to graduate tech school, which is like a college where you learn about your job but you march and wear nice uniforms, and make it to my first duty station. I've fallen back many times here because this course it's hard and it's made me rethink whether sometimes I'm really happy in life and if would rather be dead. Not just that but just how damn stupid I felt when I first started all the way back in January of this year. I've made it this far but right now what's making it seem to make it hard these last 2 weeks I have left is cause I feel hard for a girl in my class. I meet her back in February and although we rarely talked she was the first one to mess with me with what I call a ""Oreo diplomacy"" in which she gives me oreo's and I don't bully her simple. Over time I grew closer to liking her for a moment in believed I would make through if I stayed with her. Although I never told her that I never dated anyone else in my life and that I've secretly been dealing with depression,stress, anxiety, and a bit of suicide I kept smiling in class,making her laught, learning about her life back home, and over all finding out how much I love her for who she is. I was willing to sacrifice everything and I mean everything to be with her. She lives in another state no problem I'll move were that way her parents don't kick her out and she becomes homeless. Like God I though why do I love and care so much about people when I don't care much about myself. Why did she have to be the only girl i liked here and why did I messed it up.... Last week I was struggling with anxiety over a test we had last Friday which I passed but the whole week I was scared I wouldn't pass and I wouldn't be able to be in her class. At this point im.only here cause of her and when I told her I liked her on Sunday it was out of desperation. You see she has never dated anyone before and her first relationship was her with some Navy cunt. She was hurt when he basically left her and all she wanted was friends to help her get over. But nope.... I had to come around and put my feelings into her. I'm not sure how long she dated him or how long ago was their breakup probs 1 to 2 months ago. But she was still hurting and it makes sense I would too if I ever dated anyone. But already last weekend I wanted to see her tell her how I felt but time and time again the weather and God were against me. Not just that but her best friend who knew about my crush with her told me to just tell her how I felt but not be surprised when she rejects me.... I'm a dumbass of all proportions instead of hanging out when she wanted to on Sunday I ran off from the group of our friends and going back to my dorms I cried off in text how I felt about her... everyone worried about me and ever her telling me they are scared I might commit suicide, which wasn't true I was heartbroken and upset at myself cause another girl rejected me. I've never told anyone about my depression or my plans to commit suicide until that day they had me sit in front of my Sergent and explain to him and my friends why I was upset. I hate them they betrayed my trust and had me send the rest of my Sunday in a hospital for mental health check up. That whole evening I spent texting them all how I didn't want to be here all I wanted was to fix what I broke and now look what I get for loving people for caring for people.... I always cared treated others with respect.... why God treats me this way. On Monday of this week I met with a physiologist but they make an appointment cause I'm about to leave. That same day I went to class no expecting much but all I saw was her all damn day she looked upset and alone... I stupidly walked up to her and tried to just ""talk"" like nothing happen and she just said she was busy... since then all week I've been feeling worst and worst I don't want to go back to that hospital or be sent there. I act normal to those friends who reported me so they think im ok when truthfully I'm not ok all week long in the same class as her pretending like we don't know each other giving her space when I want to tell her in person that I'm sorry. Fuck I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry please I wanted to just make this friendship last beyond the time we have now so when I can I can visit you or you can visit me. Fuck everyone else is tired of me saying how much I liked her and no one wants to listen to me anymore.... now it's Friday today my buddy who reported me is basically getting a position here at the dorm and so is she as like assistants to the Chaplin which I'm happy for sorta but mad cause it's like God somehow gives them both everything and I'm left here crying, vomiting for no reason cause I'm just sick to my stomach with how shitty my life is right now. My mind plays tricks on me all week we ran into each other, accidentally looked at each other, and everytime she came over to sit with our group of friends she would just sit alone or I would.leave and she would join them.... fuck I though for once in my shitty life where I grew up poor and in the ghetto fatherless and motherless. From domestic abuse to domestic abuse and to a damn homeless shelter I could finally feel proud I made it here I'm wearing this uniform but no I have no one that cares about me and those that do soon turn on me. And all did was respect others kept to myself and prayed to God I would give a better life to whatever family I could have someday. But here I am watching my buddy and her almost talk to each other and hang out like they like each other even though he says he likes someone else the way they are with each other is like they've forgotten what I went through and how I'm dealing with this is not ok. But they could careless about me they are almost like meant for each other and I hate that cause why couldn't it be me? Why did you bring them both in my life God? So I can just watch every girl that comes my way get snatched up by some other guy? So you can laugh at me for believing in true love and that I can be accepted by someone? Why why why why why why am I so horrible why couldn't she accept me what did I do wrong where did I go wrong. I want to finish my classes but it's hard when she's the one thing on my mind and everyone is just tired of seeing my gloomy face yet she pretends its all ok. She says she's an introvert and she enjoys being alone and all that but I seen a side of her where she has lied about everything.... she enjoys the company of her friends... the friends I used to have... now I dream where she us happy with someone else and me a loser who would have given up on his dreams would have gave her my whole heart and all I asked was that she became the one I deserved to have in my life the one God sent to be with me but it won't happen. Like everyone of my crushes she is special and i like her for who she is and seeing her go away from my life hurts me cause I messed up I messed up my life and every opportunity to do great things it's gone from me. This week I'm full of tests and shit so I need to focus yet with every look that gives me when she turns around and looks my direction and with every pass by and with every memory I've had with her I wonder did ever really liked me or she played with my feelings even now...
I don't ask for much but to blessed one day that someone may like me before I die that I'm not a bad person and I've never done anything bad and never will so why am I such a loser and a loner....
I don't want to date anyone in the civilian side most of yall won't be understandable when your love one is away for so long and I'm scared ill get cheated on so I have nothing in my sea of opportunities just a career that I'll do a great job at and a future with no one to share.....
Cause she feels like the last person I could ever dreamed about created a bright future with someone I would have loved unconditional if only I wasn't me and my life was normal it could had worked out....

If it matter at all I joined the airforce on November 9th graduated btm December 31st so I'm basically still fresh in..."

She’s the only one that actually listens, and seems to care. 
I trust her with my life. We share a ton of interests. We just click. And so I’ve recently come to the conclusion that I do in fact love her. Now, we’ve BOTH said that we love the other, but just platonic. At least that’s how she intended it. When I responded back with “I love you too” it’s really wasn’t platonic. 

Now I know what you’re saying. “Why not just tell her”. And I’ll tell you why. 

Firstly: she dated my longest time guy friend for 2 years.

Secondly: She currently has a new bf whom I don’t know personally. And she seems happy with him

I don’t want to look like a snake that waited for my friend and her to break up just so I could get in. And I definitely don’t want to wreck her relationship with this new guy
I just want her to be happy. And if I tell her things will change between us, and I have a feeling it won’t be for the better.

Or has given away because there no longer is a promise and then I realized something , we all have one person that we want to love us and we want them to promise so they won’t leave us because of this some people exchange jewelry ( I would know) but when that ring was given to the other person they weren’t thinking about selling it at a resale shop or giving it away they were thinking about keeping it and sharing that love with each other.

May 8th, 2021

I met him yesterday. It could have been earlier, had I applied to that job. Of course, they required two more years of customer servicing that I never could have fulfilled in the six months before they opened. Still, a part of me wanted to say “Fuck it!”, and apply anyway, but I never did.

His eyelashes were so long and beautiful. I considered telling him telling him that, but for some inexplicable reason, the thought was tossed away and disregarded, so I simply thanked him for selling me my joints. When I flashed my debit card he asked me what I thought of my bank. I resorted to hating it because that's who I was in that moment. I liked doing that. I turned into a caricature of myself; taking a strong stance about something and playing it up. It's like a little conversation game, a little bait, to see if the other person bites. Keeps things interesting.

He did bite, and we talked about how shitty our mutual bank was for a few minutes. This was one of those moments where my adult life was beginning to cement and I could feel it hardening with every word. I’m turning 21, and now I'm talking about how shitty the credit union I was signed up for by my mom when I was 11 is. What’s next, dunking on the awful state of the roads we drive on? The price of meat at Costco is a solid contender as well. 

As someone who works with customers every single day, I can tell when somebody is customer servicing me, or just being themselves. In this instance, it truly felt like we connected as two individuals. Truthfully, it didn't occur to me until on my way home, that there was even a chance that he was just customer servicing me and enjoying it. These types of people are near invincible and should be regarded as psychopaths.

Now, I used to be very friendly to people in public spaces. Very accomodating to the chatty people on the bus. I could probably write a Bus Excerpts from my life, which would ALSO be a love excerpt if I'm being honest. But then, in the last stretch of the pandemic, I regressed. I no longer invite or facilitate these kinds of interactions, and I have purposefully drifted away from socializing with even the closest people in my life. But that’s not the focus here.
As we were chatting in this tiny apple-store-esque smoke shop, to my own reluctance I was slowly backing out, turning away, rocking on my feet, until eventually, I inched out the door with a meek “Thank you”. And I didn't have any thoughts about it again.

Until I was across the street and about 60 steps away. ‘I should have asked for his number!’ Ten more feet away… ‘I would never have asked for his number.’ And thus my guilt dissolved. I'm not the type of person who asks for other people's numbers. That is incredibly, momentarily, vulnerable. So I told myself I would visit the store and try again. I realized I had forgotten to buy my usual 10 pack for the week anyway. And what, exactly, was I even “trying again”? If you had asked me right after the thought, I wouldn’t have had an answer. I just knew that I needed to try.

I was, give or take, 100 feet away from my house. Absolutely winded from the climb, and a little irritable now. The last part of the journey always ends like this. I have this little set of rules for myself too. I’ll spare the details, bar this important one; Never be the first person to stop and rest. I knew there was a person on their bike trailing up the path behind me, so naturally, I knew I had to flex on them by showing them how in shape I was. I don’t smoke every single day, look at me go, I’m never absolutely winded from that two-minute uphill trail. Good job, me. 

I was doing great, less than 100 feet from my house now, when the person on the bike swerves up in front of me and yells, ""Hey! I think I just sold you weed!""
I let out an honest “HA!” and I can’t help but grin. He laughs too, and somehow we slip right back into the conversation. Much like the shitty bank, there was nothing special about the topic. But I felt us connect again. It was so easy, so uncaring and so, so vulnerable. It was like we both couldn't help but be anyone but ourselves. My cursed brain finally relieved from the thought of how much I wanted to see him again. Less than 30 seconds later, I got to the front of my house and said, ""Well, good luck riding up the rest of the mountain."" 
He gave me a shy smile and replied, ""Right, I'll leave you alone now."" Instantly I felt a pang of guilt in my chest.

I was already turned and had taken a few steps up my driveway, when I heard him say, ""Oh! You live right here."" I gave him an awkward smile. ""Yeah, I- Yeah. It was nice meeting you."" 

And as if I had imagined this entire interaction, he was gone. In all likelihood, he didn't think much of this interaction. Maybe a little, ‘Wow, such a small world!’ incredulousness, but nowhere near as monumental as whatever was going on with my brain. Or, maybe I’m wrong, but I don't think the emotions behind either of our motivations mean much of anything at this moment.

If I’m being honest with myself, I couldn't help but project my own disappointment onto him. That split-second moment where I left him feeling awkward - or unwanted- I recognize like it was my own reflection. He told me just how far away I had drifted from myself. I needed to let Bike Boy know that I can be vulnerable, that I love other people wholeheartedly and unconditionally. I needed to try.

Saturday morning was perfect. I woke up at 6am, loved the fact that I could sleep in more than I loved sleep itself, and reveled in that until about 10am. I needed an outfit conversation-worthy, I needed to smell great, and I absolutely needed to be myself. Which meant no writing down conversation beforehand, no self-conscious actions, and no expectations. Notice I said self-conscious actions, and not thoughts because that is a ridiculous demand if you are someone like me.
If this guy was working today, I had no doubt in my mind I was going to reel him in. The weird part was that I was being myself, presentation and all, but I felt like I was watching it happen. Like a director crafting each and every movement of an actor on set. Didn’t matter, helped with my confidence anyhow. 

Each step towards the goal was invigorating, I would even describe it as beautiful (I swear I wasn’t high). No hero’s journey can be complete without conflict and as usual, mine consisted of man versus self. I wish I could say that the near panic attack in the coffee shop was eye-opening. But I don’t think there’s a force on this planet that can crush my hope when it comes to romance. 

I wish I could say I ran into him on my way there because, damn, what a story that would make. But it was just a peaceful, sunny walk. I had been listening to music that was in hilarious contrast with my personality, and my style, but it made me feel like I was someone important. That’s a good tip if you’re someone like me; listen to music that makes you feel like the main character from a slice-of-life movie. 
The door to the tiny shop was opened, I slide into the room and around the wall blocking my view from the counter… and there sat a short, adorable blonde girl smiling down at her phone. I greeted her kindly and swallowed the bundle of social anxiety nerves I felt arise in my throat. It wasn't until I left the store that I felt the disappointment. Even after I had told myself not to be, and to just enjoy the act of doing this in the first place, I definitely knew how this particular ending would turn out for me. 

The thing about my pitfalls, though, is that most of them come with hope, as well. It is maybe my most unfounded, illogical feeling, but I think that's the point of hope. So really, I don’t think there is such thing as a “hopeless romantic”. All love is intertwined with hope. Not in the way that, like, you have hope in seeing the person again, or having hope that they’ll fall in love with you, but more so that loving them (even against your own will) is an act of hope. Your body, your brain chemicals, they have that shit built in whether you like it or not. It’s annoying and it makes you do dumb shit, but sometimes that dumb shit works out. Sometimes it does not.

The closer I got home, the more I wanted to wait for him. I had to sit somewhere he couldn't miss me if he were going to work, or even just into town. I don't think I've ever been happier to live in such a small place. And, yes, I realize how weird and creepy this was. It was romantic to a desperate and lonely mind. There's a two-lane road in a school zone that leads towards the way into the biggest part of town. Perfect. This is ridiculous. 

But it was the only way to repent for betraying myself. I still don’t fully feel like I want to be so open again, but I know it’s so much more natural to me than whatever I am doing now. It's the only chance I have to let this guy know I think of him as a person. I see him and I've thought about him. I want to be vulnerable, with everybody. I want everyone to be able to bear witness to my self and to judge me. I want them to know that I am my own internal source of power and no external value can be my fuel (Okay, now I was high). So I wait for him. 

It's cloudy and windy now. But the sun will also shine through occasionally. Sometimes tiny leaves blow into my face but it doesn't bother me enough to move. I sat there, writing all of this down and occasionally smoking a joint until I can bring myself to look at the time. 1:32p.m. I don't remember what time I sat down, but I left my house around eleven this morning. I’m not even disheartened by my efforts though. Whether I sat down to see Bike Boy again, or if I sat down for a different reason, it doesn’t matter. I just sat on wet grass, for like, 2 and a half hours on a Saturday by myself. It was time to head home. I could always try again when I run out of smokes.

When I think of Bike Boy now, I can see what he represents. I said he was a reflection of myself and that still rings true. But he is an example of how my past relationships have failed, of my own wrongdoings and miscalculated steps. I have a lot of thinking to get done, most of it too raw to share, but thank you for reading this far."

ForeignJones,lonely,1620300168.0,"Funny or not, I don’t know.","You know, I guess it is kinda funny in some way, to me at least. Seeing how people have come and go throughout my life. I’ve gotten used to it. I’m not sure if people really get the opportunity to keep friendships or if they also come and go for them as they do for me. It’s a crazy mystery to me. 

Regardless. Whether this pandemic has affected the very little social life I already or if I’ve just simply become a complete loner, it’s all beyond me. I used to talk to people, now they’re strangers to me. We used to share music with each other, now they don’t even send me a text back. We used to send memes to each other, now the only person sending me memes is myself. And saying that out loud makes me laugh. 

I’m not sure if I’m sad, depressed, indifferent, or happy and comfortable with myself anymore. But at least I do get a laugh out of it."

Luckily, I am moving to uni in a couple of months but it just hurts to know I’m probably going to be spending this summer alone and not able to hang out as much, because apparently they’re too “busy” or “broke,” despite always seeming to be together and spending hundreds on matching tattoos.

starzwillsucceed,lonely,1619849815.0,Beware of fake users that claim to be a young women looking for a good man.,"Yesterday night I(35m) was contacted by a user(27f) on reddit that claimed to be a young woman in the army. She consoled me with her opening remarks about my posts of being lonely she found on this sub r/lonely. I was suspicious from the start because the profile had 1 karma and was 1 year and 4 months old. 

I decided to just go with it since I am by myself most of the time since I live alone and if this user was who they claimed to be, then cool, I made a new friend. 

We talked for a bit and I then moved on to ask if she wanted to exchange pictures. We decided to use Google hangouts for this (her ask, not mine). She was really really beautiful and I was surprised that she would resort to reddit for attention from a male. But I just kept the conversation rolling while still being cautious. 

I then asked if she wanted to exchange social media such as Facebook or Instagram and she told me she had no social media at all. I was kind of surprised of this so I just wanted some way for her to verify that the pictures she was sending of herself were of her. I simply asked her to send a selfie on hangouts of her holding up three fingers while touching her nose with her middle finger. I even sent her one of me doing the same so she had something to reference. If she sent one back of her with the desired pose of the same woman in the selfies she sent earlier, then I would have been content to know that I was talking to the person she claimed to be. She said okay, but then ghosted me quickly after. 

I digress. The internet is full of people trying to get attention from us or trying to find ways to prey on lonely men AND women that will most likely lead to them asking for money or support when they aren't who they say they are.

This woman was very forward with how much she wanted a good man and had long prepared statements that seemed to be copied and pasted of her desire for a long, happy life with a man that would treat her right and love her unconditionally. I was very skeptical with this. I'm glad I've always had a sense to question everything until certain because for someone not prepared for seeing these things, someone else could have easily been taken advantage of.

Be careful men and women of people who message you on Reddit. I would suggest always questioning everything until you know for sure who you are talking is the person they claim to be."
Mattthew261,lonely,1620180104.0,Trying not to be an incel,First this is my first Reddit post so I am not sure how this will play out since I am new to the whole reddit community so please just bear with me. I am 44 years old and worried that I am turning into an Incel. I know there are two types of incels: One who is just involuntarily celibate and one who is involuntarily  celibate and is a bitter and angry person toward women and men who are sexually active. I really do not want to become a hateful incel. I have serious confidence issue due to repeated rejections and weight issues. For a long time I thought that only assholes get the girl and that nice guys don't even finish. I no longer believe that is about being nice or an asshole. I think it is about confidence. And that is my problem. The good news is that I have began a journey of self improvement. I have began lifting weights 2 times day and bike riding 3 times a week. I have also cut down sweets and snack to a bare minimum and are starting to see results at the gym. My hope that if I  work my appearance that maybe women can look past my lack of confidence.

It’s the only source of joy or anything resembling happiness. Other than that I get up, go to work, come home, light one up and sit alone in the dark pretending everything is okay.

Never-a-Boyfriend,lonely,1620103047.0,"cant say this to any irl fam, sorry to dump it on you guys but i felt disingenuous not to","Someone I really respect took me to task recently, and one thing that they said was I needed to ""be my best self"" rather than the person I had become.

I love this person with my heart, no doubt but in that moment I nearrly lost it, ended up telling them that opinions were like armpits, just about everbody had one or two, and a lot of the time they just plain stink. Left the house post haste, befor I said something else stupid and regretted it nearly immidiately. I wasn't wrong, just lacking in tact, as ""my better self "" would say. 

My Better Self

They did what better selves do. Stood by the ones they cared about, no matter what, right or wrong. Loyalty was one of the few things that no one could ever take away from you, or force from you. Like respect, it is earned, and when it is mutual there can be strength like no one could comprehend. They took it to the mat, took punches took time, and and hits. They did all of the things that a better self is expected to do, and really more than that sometimes. Giving of themselves until, sometimes there was so little left they would fall into bed just long enough to start to fall asleep, when the alarm clock would remind them of their promises. Suffering in silence is the better self credo, as I'm sure you know. 

They did the thing that makes a better self into a Best Self. They gave everthing that they had, or were ever going to have. Stepped in front of the bullet with a smile on their lips. 

At least thats what I have been told. Usually just before asking why I can't be like that again. 

If I could, don't you think I would? God, I fall asleep every night begging the Universe to please, just let me wake up him. PLease... The light is gone, though. and all that remains is the shadow. I can remember most of what made him, me, me. It's just not automatic. It's studied. Out of sync with my new sense of perception. I have to work hard as hell to be kind. I cant slack up a bit, or I don't know what will happen. The worst is the feeling that I'm letting the people I care about down, just by being alive. Like I fail them every day, just by existing, but I can't blame them. 

I blame me. Him. That goody-goody sonofabitch. Who the fuck did he think he was, fucking Jesus? Asshole. ASSHOLE!!!! Evertime I watch a vid of him or see a picture, I wish I could reach through the damn screen and punch him on the damn nose. This is it.

I can feel the grudge and annoyance that my friend group feels towards me when I speak a word. I’m just the 3rd wheel that tries to get in on the conversations but they just push you back out.

Every single friendship I’ve been in has ended in hatred against each other. It starts off with feeling like you’re settled in, but soon enough it allll turns to shit. And I know and feel that it’s all my fault, my personality, my ugly-ness, my body, my presence makes everything worse. My presence annoys everyone, not just friends, annoys my mother, my brothers, myself.
Sick of being a socially inept, fat, ugly, dumb, stupid, piece of shit thing. I deserve nothing more than a cardboard box on the side of a road, no one would notice a thing if I was gone.

InconsequentialMike,lonely,1620112089.0,Today I realised that the ability to cry is a form of mercy.,"There were days where I wish I could just cry and let these pent up anger and confused emotions out. But I can't. I just can't force these tears outta my eyes even though I really want to.

When I was in my 20s, I used to joke with my friends that ""I've forgotten how to cry""; To show how tough I am.

But now, I realised... I lost my way a long time ago. Crying is mercy. Mercy for yourself. If you lose that mercy, you lose your compassion towards others. 

And that is why I am now I am friendless. I suppose if I had been more open with my ""feelings"", I'd be able to bond with people better and still have friends around who genuinely cared for me.

Abusive ex rubs it in my face to top it off.,"Posting this on a backup account for some reason.. well, I left my emotionally abusive boyfriend in february he really took a toll on my mental health im 17 and have no job idk how to get into therapy without my parents judging me. Im just tired. My ex reached out to me and sent me a picture of his new gf sitting in his lap. I blocked him and I started crying im so alone. I dont understand how he gets to move on and be happy and i sit here alone crying in bed being depressed because of all the shit he did to me. He hurt me in every way possible any interest i had he judged, whatever clothes i wore he judged me for, he never supported anything i wanted to do. I was ready to marry him as soon as I turned 18 because he wanted to go to the military and I wanted to be with him. I was willing to do anything to be with him until he started abusing me. I feel like I will never be able to be happy. Im not the hottest girl and im asexual no guy is going to want me. I just want to be loved properly but im just a shy girl with social anxiety. I want to feel a connection with someone, hold hands, have someone be in love with me and do romantic things for me but whatever..

Thanks everyone who commented!"
Rasta-Grandpa,lonely,1619917073.0,Has anyone here ever seen the other side from a very dark and sad place?,"I'm going to try to keep this short but like many of us the only friends that I ever really had never were there for me and ended up just taking advantage of me whenever they had the opportunity. I've never really met another person who wasn't mainly interested in themselves. I used to be in a band but that fell apart because my bassist ended up being one of those toxic people.

I utilized COVID for some personal self-development, I've landed myself a pretty cool job but my co-workers are mostly remote.  I am in a much better position in my personal life as opposed to my social. I am basically a quiet monk and nobody ever notices me. I am even involved in 2 volunteering organizations and even that hasn't granted me any friends or relationships either.

Everyone including my therapist just tells me to just wait, and that my time will come. I don't believe that. I think removing myself from my social circles before COVID has doomed me forever.

I'm starting to see a lot of things changing and people getting vaccinated, being excited to party in the summer. What am I doing? I take a step outside and it's just as shitty as it was on the inside. I still don't have friends. I still haven't dated anyone in 2 years. I'm 25 and I only make $15 for now, but I'm busting my ass at my job and trying to be creative.

Just because the vaccines are out doesn't mean we're returning to any semblance of normal anytime soon. The lingering anxiety will remain there for probably the next couple years to come, as I don't want to bother anyone or assume myself in anyone's personal space. I just want good for everybody. But I've only ever gotten taken advantage of. No one has ever had my back or loved me unconditionally besides my mom maybe. My sister is back home from her first year college and she hangs out with friends EVERY DAY while I stay inside. God fuck it's kinda hard to write this.

This is probably one of the darkest and most depressing periods I've ever experienced in my life. The isolation is actually killing me, and I think I can feel it in my body. Every day I carry death close to me, right by my side. It's always on my mind, and I don't want to die, but I feel like I'm going to die very soon. I'm in a place where it doesn't feel like my life was cut out for this, and that I need to either burn out slowly like a candle or just end it ASAP.

I'm willing to wait if the summer makes things any better, but I'm not expecting anything. Whenever any semblance of an opportunity appears (its never the ideal one) I never allow myself to let it take place in my mind. I'm stuck in the all-too-familiar rock-bottom depression for me to actually feel happy. It feels almost like an oxymoron; I can't possibly feel happy, because the world is full of suffering and misery. I'm probably somewhat sabotaging myself here, but I want to make friends, I just don't know what else to do next. I sob to myself every other night. I seriously just want to be free again.

I just wanted to ask, has anyone ever taken themselves out of this even temporarily and was able to feel happy again? Does it just take time to get used to or is it something that just hits you and then suddenly you're ok again? Why is everyone so excited for things to go back? It'll never ever be the same."

_Cheeseburger_cake_,lonely,1620146715.0,Rather long boring story of lonliness,"Ok, so first of all I am not the best writer and I apologize for any grammar issues and spelling errors. I am also not the best at getting my point across or sharing my feelings and this will be a long read. Feel free to read or not. Just felt the urge to vent / share and figured I would post it here. NOTHING I am writing is an attempt for pity. I just wanted to share my experiences and maybe it can help someone else out and maybe it will help me a bit to share instead of keeping it bottled up. With that out of the way let's begin. 


Currently I am a 36 year old lonely male.

When I was 17 I watched on TV the events of 9/11 as many others did. Up to this point I had no idea what I would do with my life. As I watched something clicked inside of me. It was a resolution. I would bring the pain they gave us americans that day to them. My naive 17 year old self thought. Promptly I reported to the closets USMC recruiting depot. Not long after I was on my to Paris Island. (not going to indepth here) After basic training I was quickly sent to Iraq in 2003 for my first combat tour. After this tour I came back and was given 45 days of leave which I used to go back home. At this point I was blissfully unaware how this war would effect me and my relationships. While home on leave I met a southern belle and we dated long distance for about a year after my leave ended. At which point we got married. Soon after that I was deployed to Iraq a second time. 

During this deployment I was involved in an ied explosion which it seemed I escaped relatively unharmed except for some back pain. Once my deployment ended I spent the last of my time with my wife before finally moving back home. 

Once back home though our relationship fell apart I started to have night terrors etc and on top of that I was having a hard time finding work and going to college. Our relationship ended in a divorce for no true reason that comes to mind. Which is funny because we still talk to this day. It just didn't work out. 

Finally I finished college and got a decent job. While working this second job I met my second wife. We fell in love quickly (I am a romantic for better or worse. I once bought out an entire restaurant for a private date. ) We got married and had two kids. Life was good. I had good job, a stay at home wife a picket fence etc. Only thing is my back was hurting more and more and the night terrors continued. (25 around this time)

One year after our second kids birth died in their sleep at night one week before Christmas. Unopened presents and full stockings etc... Death certificate listed it as unknown and this is where everything started to go ""wrong"" my life. my wife and I  grew distant. I ended up getting hurt at work. Badly. I was pulled from a utility pole by a logging truck not paying attention. They never found the driver. I was in the hospital for about three weeks. 

It took another 9 months to recover enough to get back to work. Now I noticed my back still hurts and I'm getting this weird tremor in my right hand. I would ignore it another year or so. At this point I am still married with my second wife and we still had our one child. 

Soon after I returned to work I went to see a back specialist at which point I'm told after an mri my back has a crushed vertebrae that looks like it's been that way awhile. After some investigation we concluded it happened when I was in the ied explosion. After some surgery my work laid me off / fired me for being absent from work for so long. My wife left then too the day after Christmas. A really hard time of year for me. (30 around this time)

Now forced to sell my home and deal with a second divorce I move in with my friend from work paying him very little in rent. Meanwhile my ex is now dating again and looks extremely happy it's soul crushing. I also work odd jobs like delivery etc as looked for more stable work. 

The hand tremors I had start to get worse by 32-33. So I start to go see nuerologists at which point I get diagnosed with early on-set Parkinson's the doctor says it's likely due to chemical exposure in iraq. (burn pits. Ewww)

Which brings me to today. 36 haven't dated since my divorce. Haven't worked in 4-5 years due to the Parkinson's and left over effects of back surgery etc and worsening ptsd (6-7 years ago) Living a lone and occasionally seeing my kid when able too. 

Even though I feel very lonely often and my body is slowly losing control of it's self I can't sleep more than a few hours at a time, can't really exercise like I would want to, become a shut-in and am keenly aware no women would ever want a man with my issues I'm still thankful and strive to make myself happy. 

I'm thankful I get to spend time trying to learn new skills, I don't get nagged, I have a beautiful kid,ore time for hobbies, got lucky and don't really have to have a job, and I am still alive

I guess my point is life can be very cruel and very hard but if anyone out there is drowning in despair and lonliness find something to make yourself happy don't rely on a boy or a girl to make you happy. Make yourself happy first so if you do find someone your not super reliant on them and can also make for a better relationship. In my opinion. 

Then if that boy or girl leaves you can coupe with it. Try to make a few friends even if it's just internet friends.  

I still hope someday I may find someone to put up with me and my issues but if I don't that's ok too. 

I just felt like sharing and venting a bit. If you read all of this thank you and have a great day. I skipped over a lot of details and events but if I covered everything this post would be a book. Lol.

Edit: 

Also my dms are open if anyone feels like talking a bit or whatever."
bigbjosh,lonely,1620599853.0,Dumped,"Dumped couple days ago cause she fell out of love with me. Relationship had been rocky and i could tell we were drifting apart so i was hurt but i kind of expected it not to work, just thought we'd last longer. I was flirty by nature and continued to in the beginning of the relationship. I hurt her and so and id done alot to make her feel secure, saying things to my female friends, telling them to basically leave me alone and id lost contact with male ones id said nothing to. Its true that i cut people out that looking back i needed to but currently i feel like i have no one. But at the same tine thats not true...I have people that care for me parents, fellow athletes but i don't have what id consider true friends.

is it unfair for me to try and rekindle friendships that i told to fuck off now that its convenient for me?"

Echo-Blank,lonely,1620546199.0,My computer screen and I,"My computer is never off anymore. Every minute I’m home, I’m going from Discord server to Discord server, google tab to google tab. It used to be video games but quite honestly I’ve grown bored of all my games as of late. They’re just— not fun. When I’m not on the computer, I’m watching Youtube, researching random shit, or browsing Reddit. That’s my daily life. I’m not saying I regret it, or don’t enjoy doing these things, but...

I want friends to go play sports with. Go on little adventures, eat out every once in a while, or just go somewhere nice to talk and hang out. When your only interest is computers and you have bad social anxiety your environment becomes very familiar, very quick. I would say I care more about my desktop environment than I do my room, because that’s where I spend the most time looking. My PC is customized more than you’d believe. Most of the programs on startup, I’ve written the software myself. I enjoy employing automation in every way I can.

Right now one of my main goals is to learn everything I possibly can about computer hardware and software systems. I just want to be really really good in one area of expertise. I read paper after paper, article after article, just going down the rabbit hole, taking notes until I’m satisfied with my understanding of the subject. As I learn more, I also find myself going back to previous notes and refining them through another rabbit hole. Sometimes I’ll have projects in mind to keep my rabbit holes somewhat on track and to have a clear purpose, but it’s usually not going to stop me from sidetracking laterally for god knows how long lol

It gets really difficult at times to keep my motivation to learn. I yearn for someone to talk with about something I made or learned that day. I want to swap ideas back and forth. I also want to be introduced to new interests every once in a while. Loneliness is probably the most efficient way to keep me in bed, or idly listening to music and watching my custom-made audio responsive background, or have my head on my desk, wondering what I’m doing all this for anyway."

EggsOverOzzie,lonely,1619938431.0,Random lonely thoughts,"Every night while I'm in bed trying to sleep is the worst part of my day. I can't help but let my thoughts wander. 

I think of the people I used to have in my life, the people that didn't make me feel alone, and I wonder if they think of me when they're trying to fall asleep. 

I try to forget about them, find new people, but since I have yet to find someone to make me less lonely it's hard. 

The other day one of the people I'm trying to forget followed my Instagram. I texted them and never got a reply. It keeps me up wondering what that was about because they clearly stated that they wanted nothing to do with me. 

Tonight as I lay in bed hoping to never wake up again I stumbled into the reddit about of someone who I have not thought about in a month and now I can't help but think about them. I was already having a hard time because I'm about to celebrate the loneliest birthday I've ever had and that just plunged me into the depths of he'll. 

Here's hoping tomorrow never comes. Cheers"
13547USERNAME,lonely,1620074678.0,"The reason depressed, suicidal or lonely people don’t get help is NOT because of the stigma against depression. It’s because nobody gives a fuck about their problems","Every time a person who is depressed or lonely tries to get help, people trivialize their problems and gaslight them and teach them comforting lies and false hope, only for us to realize in the end they lied. 

Every time we talk to someone, they minimize our problems. You are 30 and never had a gf/bf and never could date or lose your virginity. They say “tHeRe’S mOrE tO LiFe tHaN sEx aNd dAtInG” and these are the people who get depressed over a breakup or who won’t date a virgin because they cannot handle teaching you or who get dates regularly and don’t know what it’s like in your shoes

You tell them you never made friends and are socially isolated and others have pics of them doing fun stuff online they say “but but those are just the highlights” even though their highlights are far more exciting than anything that occurs in your life and then they say “BuT yOu dOn’T kNoW wHaT gOeS oN iN tHeIr LiFe hOw Do yOu kNoW ThEy’Re hApPy?” And how do you know they’re just as miserable? Some might be miserable but a majority I’m sure are pretty happy and definitely way happier than an extrovert who is socially isolated with an uneventful life.

They tell us that friends, social events etc aren’t that fun and we aren’t missing much even though people throw these events to celebrate special holidays or their birthday. For example, if parties are boring, why do people go them all the time including after trying them out for the first time? If they sucked they wouldn’t go over and over again? Why would they throw them when celebrating a holiday or graduation or their own birthday? If hanging out with your friends isn’t so fun why do people do it so much? If concerts and bars aren’t fun why do people go to them all the time? 

Instead of helping you make new friends or find a partner or go to a fun event like a concert they just trivialize your problems.

These are the same people who went insane under quarantine. At least they had friends and a social life prior to covid while a lot of people here never did. And despite being unable to handle the tip of the iceberg of what socially isolated people dealt with they gave the audacity to trivialize our problems 

This is why depressed or lonely or suicidal people don’t get help. Even if they knew you won’t stigmatize them for being depressed they still won’t talk to you knowing you’ll gaslight them or trivialize their problems. 

This is why the suicide rate and depression rate has skyrocketed despite campaigns and people “trying” to prevent suicide/depression."
Dry-Bit5150,lonely,1620534466.0,Having a birthday on or around mother's day is so lonely,"Maybe I just suck but I like to beleive my birthdays are always so lonely because they fall on or just before mothers day. I've been okay these past few weeks I'm vaccinated and looking at apartments. I'm on the right track but my birthday just happens to fall on such an inconvenient time for someone who loves having a bunch of people around for a good hang. 

It's hard to not be in my head about it, especially since last month I had a hard break from a friend group and just not seeing the few people I did like being around. it's just been on my brain and like how we are so far from high school but yet I'm still stuck on this feeling that if I stray from a group I can't just talk to the individual(s) that I resonate with or they feel they can't just talk to me. Maybe they just never liked me. Hard to tell and hard to deal with at this point it's all still so fresh.

MessiahJohnM,lonely,1619975283.0,"If you had a new neighbor, how would you want them to try and meet you?","Hey all (TLDR at end!!):

I’m moving to a new complex in a few weeks and really want to get to know my neighbors...and even make friends with one or two if I get lucky. There’s no way over 100 people can live in one space and  none of them will be both friend worthy (and open to a friendship). 

Anyway, I’ve always been happier at poorer complexes, as the people were more often smokers AND open to friendships. I was a smoker for a couple years (half a pack a day) and when I quit people who smoked were still just as open to friendship.

With smoking being banned at most places these days, when people would likely be healthier smoking a bit and having social bonds (loneliness is worse than smoking like half a pack a day according to science), I don’t know how to meet people. I’m very open, friendly, and when I am in spaces where talking to others is encouraged (the climbing gym for ex), people like me very easily and we get along.

Making friends with neighbors is crucial for my own mental health ((probably most of us tbh)), as every time in my life I’ve felt truly happy, there was friendship and connection with people who lived close to me and/or with me. I feel like many people are depressed now *because* we lack connection with our physical surroundings and the people closest to us physically, as this is something extremely important to being a social mammal. The closer the physical proximity to a friend, the more likely that relationship is to be maintained.

TLDR:
If you had a new neighbor happy to get to know people, how would you want them to say they genuinely want to get to know their neighbors?"
Toxicman001,lonely,1620208451.0,I just want be alone with my music 🎶,"I'm 15 (still in school btw) and I hate being around most of my friends or anyone. It's not just because I hate them, it's because everyone is so loud and have no respect for others. Then they try to help by seeing if I'm ok and not leaving me alone after me telling them multiple times ""I'm fine, im not mad or anything I just want to be alone"". Normal I would deal with people and my anxiety by listening to music but my school doesn't allow us to have our phones. So we have to give them to the teachers and collect them at the end of the day. 

Anyone have advice on how to deal with this situation?"

I am miserable because the only person ive truly wanted in 37 years of life never wanted me. Ive never been able to have a relationship because no one else came close.
Im sure i sound like a creep to a lot of you and thats ok. I can assure you id never hurt anyone or mean harm. Im just tired of life . I wish i could let go but ive tried therapy multiple times, distractions etc. Idk what to do. The feeling of rejection from the only person you want is awful."
_staralfur_,lonely,1619829221.0,I cut my arms 16 times today. I want it to end. I'm tired,"I'm trying to just stay sane for a minute. but it's getting me, so badly. the scent of blood is suffocating me, I'm shivering and soaked in blood

I just want to die. I'm almost 22, and I never knew what happiness and friendship ever were. I am, without a doubt, the most unwanted person alive. I've been stacking lethal doses of different medicines for 2 years, but couldn't do it, just clinging onto any glimpse of hope. but i can't do that anymore. I'm tired. I'm tired of being shunned away by everyone so violently. I'm tired of being silent all the time. i'm tired of thinking about past trauma, and how the future won't be any different

it hurts how others can simply just be loved, and I hate myself for thinking like this. and here I am, again, one step away from ending my non-life, thinking about who could possibly care. and there is absolutely no one, outside of my family. I'm trapped in my pile of misery, disfigured by my own blood, and I have no one to even turn to. not that I think I deserve a friend, I never did. but why do I have to go through all of this unloved and unwanted?

all I'm thinking about is this quote:

""When the world hates a body, it just throws itself away to a place where our hands can't reach."""

Reddo96,lonely,1619994618.0,Any tips for when you feel like loneliness is pretty much slowly killing you?,"Being an outcast isn't really your choice sometimes.. and I don't hate it to be honest.. I believe in most cases it happens because you're someone who has boundaries and preferences you can't overlook.. in addition to being naturally weird and socially awkward.. I prefer it over spending time with people I can't find any connection with or people who are toxic and those who make you feel uncomfortable just because you're different!

it's just that sometimes loneliness gets to you on a deep level.. especially when I see groups of friends having fun or couples and families who look very happy and compatible.. there are moments where I would avoid any and every social event or interaction just to avoid having those heavy feelings.."

Just alone like I have no one to even express my emotions with, like I’m just in a loop of the same thing over and over, constantly over thinking things,checking my phone to see if anyone texted knowing no one did. 

I just miss the feeling of having someone there, someone I look forward to hearing/seeing.

I didn’t used to be like this, matter of fact you’ll never guessed I was like this by looking at me because I do a great job pretending to look happy in front of everyone and I’m also the type of guy to be the life of the party for most part.....

LordJameson7,lonely,1620356177.0,I feel like I'll never find anyone loyal,"A little background: I'm a 26 year old guy that lives in a somewhat rural part of Pennsylvania, a small town about an hour away from the big city, but very little in terms of a local dating pool. I can't find anyone local willing to even go out with me, so I've been dating girls about an hour away, thinking they'd be better, but it's the same old 2 dates, take advantage of my wallet, then ghost me. I'm honestly tired of this ghosting game, I'd rather someone honestly tell me they don't like me/hate my guts than pretend to like me and *poof* gone, at least I'd have some closure or an idea of what I did wrong/can improve upon, but when I get ghosted I have no clue, I'm just the same old me that isn't getting anywhere with dates, still feels lonely in the presence of others because I have yet to form a true connection or bond with a date in recent years. I know it's 100% my fault, I'm somewhat short, don't have ripped abs, wasn't a jock in high school (still am a nerd). I'm just a geeky computer guy, girls naturally never really took an interest in me all throughout my life until after college, and I was so God damn lonely, mentally broke down and had to go to the guidance counselor so many times just because I felt so alone and frustrated, still go to therapy today, but I'm no less lonely. I've been with 2 women officially, and 2 unofficially, I have very little dating experience for my age, most people get their first sweetheart at like 12 or 13, I lagged 10 years behind, and think I still do socially/dating wise, I'm now at the level of a high schooler, but am dating in an adult world, I'm guessing 99% of everyone has more experience than me, I have no game and it sucks. I just wish I could find my ""soul mate"" and get over all this dating shit, it's tiring, I'm lonely, and I've been alone way too God damn long for my liking, something about myself needs to change, because I'm obviously repelling women away for some reason I'm oblivious to, and I'd like to know what it is, I'm pretty good looking (aside from the height) and mostly well mannered, though can be a hothead sometimes, but I've made a lot of progress in therapy with my anger problem and it's rarely an issue anymore. Something else is hurting my game, or maybe it's just the lack thereof, but I have had sorta successful relationships before and I did it just fine back then. Thanks for reading this long ass vent, if you have any thoughts feel free to leave them below. Hope you all find someone that takes your loneliness away, just as I'd like to. Best wishes everyone."

AFatPandasaur,lonely,1620448032.0,I used to love the weekend,"I’m almost 30. I used to love the weekend. I’d get to spend my time with my friends and do whatever we pleased. Early on it was video games or being out at night playing crazy hide and seek games in the dark. Later it was going the bars or going to concerts or festivals or just relaxing in our own apartments doing whatever we wanted. I’ve had multiple relationships with girls whom I’ve truly loved. With a special someone it really didn’t matter what I did, I was just happy to be with them.

My “friends” were very toxic and abusive. It took many years before I realized that and we were no longer in each other’s lives for various reasons. I still kept one best friend though from that group. He fell to drugs and chose shittier people over me. Those same people treated me like shit and he always said “it’s just a joke man, you gotta lighten up.” If that’s how they always treated me, then it wasn’t a joke. He never got that. 

I became friends with others and was in a couple different groups of people. All of whom were also very rude to me and abusive but again to me it seemed like being picked on and treated like that was just how it worked, even though no one else in the group would ever get it as bad or as consistently as me. I couldn’t believe it was happening again. 

There was a girl who I used to have a crush on in high school and we became life long friends later. Recently she has completely stopped being my friend over something so petty, it just leaves me dumbfounded.

Oh, the relationship thing? Every single girl besides one cheated on me or lied to me or abused me emotionally. I haven’t been on a proper date in a very long time. I’ve tried online dating and it’s awful. Nothing is real. There is no emotion and no one cares. Men are a commodity for women on dating apps and thusly we are expendable and replaceable. 

I’ve been called handsome and very good looking. When asked, people have said “oh, afatpandasaur? He’s one of the nicest and kindest guys I’ve met.” I genuinely care for others and their well being. I want people to be happy, even compete strangers. I will go out of my way to help someone if I am able, no hesitation.

Yet, I have no friends. None. They all have left me. I stood up for myself and people didn’t like that. I’ve tried reaching out and nobody cares. As I said before I’ve tried online dating which seems to be the only avenue for dating and it’s demeaning and leaves me feeling so much worse. 

Due to life issues and my depression and anxiety and stupid financial decisions I’m currently living with my folks since living on my own would be so expensive I’d never be able to save money and get ahead in life. I tried and that was awful too. I’ll eventually have enough to buy a house for myself but even now the market is getting worse and worse.

My job doesn’t care if I live or die. They are awful. I work in the trades and my only coworker I see in a daily basis is a selfish racist bigoted asshole who encourages civil war. I can’t leave yet cause I don’t have another’s years worth of experience under my belt.

I’m writing this because I guess I just want my story to be heard. I want it to be heard cause maybe you know someone in your life who may be lonely. Someone who used to love the weekend. If this can spark the light that someone sees to save them, even just one person, then I feel my pain was worth it.

It’s actually something I tell myself to make myself feel better. “I’m going through this pain, this hollowing and numbing loneliness, these betrayals of love and friendship, so that someone else doesn’t have to.” To me, that makes this worth it to some degree.

This has devolved into the ramblings of a very very very sad and lonely soul. The pain has hollowed me out and I feel my strength waning. Therapy and medication didn’t help. My previous passions are lackluster. They only serve to hurt me more because I can’t even enjoy them. I ache. It won’t stop. The pain won’t stop. Not even my mom can make me feel better. 

Please please please, if you have gotten this far, fear not for me. Do not feel sad or sorry. Do not apologize or try to understand more. I have accepted my fate and while I’m still angry, I’m slowly making peace with it.

This is all I ask. 

Be kind. It’s quite literally the easiest thing you can practice. If you see someone or think someone is lonely. Reach out. Try. You may save a life.

Every single person is fighting a battle that you know nothing about.

Be kind. Enjoy your weekends."

Medical-Implement-91,lonely,1620435210.0,Storey of my life,"I've felt lonely my whole life. Every small up - not that there have been many - has come with a big crashing down. I can't trust people and haven't been able to for many years now.

OK, I'm going to give my life storey because I need to get it off my chest. If at least one person takes the time to read it, it would mean alot to me. I'm 37 by the way. 

When I was a child, I could never make friends. I was shy and awkward, and I would cry at what most people would say is nothing. I was very lonely. I was like this right up until I was about 15. I know right? A little old to be so sensitive. I felt excluded and bullied constantly. Then I snapped one day and decided to start giving people crap. Anyone that came my way got it. Not a healthy choice right? But there it is. Why is it people only respect selfish assholes? I just want one person in life I can share things with and be myself.

This harder but disrespectful attitude led to me forming a few relationships (friends). I hung around with them. We went out cycling for fun and shared our interests. But then my true sensitivity and quietness eventually started to show, and they left me to hang out with other people. I was devestated. I felt lonely again. I would call them to hang out and chase them around like a fool. And if I pestered them enough, sometimes they would. I couldn't see that they had me dangling like an idiot. Then I met my girlfriend through one of my so called friends.

I was 17 and she was 15. After a couple of weeks I very stupidly accidently told this girl I loved her. I guess I felt desperate to have someone in my life that would not leave me. She said it back and I promised her I would never leave her. We stayed together for 12 years... Out of obligation to a promise. Until I was 29. We didn't really love each other.

At the start of the relationship we started smoking weed. All of my so called friends smoked it and a couple of years after I got with my girlfriend they all got married moved away and had kids. Lucky them. I felt abandoned. I still do, and it's been 20 years. I remember each and every person that has ever hurt me like it was yesterday. None of these friends ever bothered to contact me again. I assume they stopped smoking weed. I guess I only smoked it for so long because psychologically it was the only thing getting me by. I know that's not true but I was mentally addicted. It makes you think you're happy at the time, until it wears off and you need more. It just adds to your depression. 

The girlfriend never once again said she loved me during our entire 12 year relationship and again, like the fool I am, I chased her around and kept trying to have conversations that actually meant something to me for 11 years. She would say all the wrong things and repeatedly broke my heart. So we argued. The whole time she just got high, avoided talking about anything that mattered to me, and slept constantly. She wasn't in the relationship at all. Not caring. Like always, I felt alone the whole time.

Near the beggining of the relationship we moved in together and I met a guy who smoked weed too, but he had anger issues, got into fights all the time, and actually spoke proudly of it. I pretended to be like him so I could have a friend. We got to spend the next 11 years sharing our problems with each other. In a way I feel lucky to have had that, but it was at the cost of my integrity. I was being fake and all I wanted to do deep down was quit smoking weed and be myself again. Truthfully I'm gentle. So I still felt alone inside the whole time.

During this relationship my girlfriend would constantly slag off my family and actually turned me against them. I was a fool. Then in 2007, my father died of lung cancer. He was only on his late 50's. It was a two year battle with two operations and in the end he suffocated. He was honestly on my side in life. My girlfriend was not supportive about his death at all. You always have to deal with your problems yourself. Nobody really cares. 

Just before my father got lung cancer my mother left my father for someone else and I could not understand why. I watched as she visited the house every day giving him false hope for two years and all the while he was deteriorating with cancer. My father would beg me sometimes not to let her in the house anymore if she came, because she was wearing him down. But the house was half hers and I couldn't stop her. My father was so strong and I watched him become so weak. I hated her for it. 

After my father died my younger brother was left in the house alone and was obviously devestated at such a young age, so I pushed down my own feelings and moved in to take care of him. I never even cried. My girlfriend was not happy despite the fact that she got to move from a tiny flat into a largish house and the bills would be alot cheaper. She just hated my family and I hated my mother for what she had done to my father. 

I argued with my mother for the next few years while I lived there. I wanted to move out. The same thing all the time. I would say. 'You have to move in with your son, so I can have my life back. I've given up my life for you.' She flat out refused the whole time acting like she was doing me some big favour. 

Throughout my entire life I had no money. The debt piled up and in the end I declared bankruptcy. Me and my girlfriend never had any money despite us both working full time. I've lived on the edge my whole life. This only added to the pressure between us. I started work as a delivery boy and met a guy that worked there who would bring weed to the house. 

Then when I was 29 my girlfriend finally left me. All the misery and loneliness in my life hit me at once, and I cried uncontrollably for weeks. All day, every day and in my sleep too. Yes, it's possible. I would wake up with the pillow soaked with tears. Everyone leaves me and I leave everyone.

Then one day I found an app filled with quotes from Buddha and one stood out to me,

""If you find no one to support you on the spiritual path, walk alone. There is no companionship with the immature.""- Gautama Buddha

This got me thinking how I had lived my whole life in service to others and got nothing but misery and loneliness for it. So I stopped talking to people. I mean everyone. Even the people at my workplace. I thought if no-one could get in my head and control me, then no-one could hurt me. Believe it or not I didn't speak to a soul for the next two years or three years. And guess what? I got stronger. That's right! It turns out you DON'T need people. I finally stopped crying and I stopped smoking weed and I took care of myself better and my confidence increased. I took my life back. But it didn't come without any downsides.

You see, because I wasn't speaking at work they started bullying me. Some of them would call me a bastard, some of them let the air out of my tires, and the guy that used to bring me weed burgled my house twice. I had evidence that it was him. They even employed a prostitute and tried to trick me into dating her. It was awful.

Then one day out if the blue some police officers suddenly showed up at work and arrested me. Apparently the boss there had told them that I had gone insane and started busting the place up and intimidating all the staff. It wasn't true of course. The next thing I know they are taking me to a hospital and accusing me of having schizophrenia when I was really just trying to protect myself from people.

They put me on a two weekly injection. What they thought it was doing I have no idea, because I still refused to talk to anyone. You see I felt so much stronger alone. While I was like this my emotions were stable as a rock.

Work fired me and I could not afford to pay the mortgage on my mother's house anymore. She would send me big abusive messeges blaming me and saying 'now I have to sell the house because of YOU' even though her house should have been her own responsibility. 

The house was sold and I had nowhere to live. I slept in my car for  a while then my mother decided to take me into her spare room even though she was not allowed because if her landlady. I supposed it was nice of her, but I did not trust her after everything and I still did not speak a word to anyone. I felt peaceful inside. For the first time in my life I didn't need people.

The next thing I know my mother gave me £38,000. You have to understand throughout her entire life she always tried to buy my affection. She even stole me away from my father when I was young by bad mouthing him, and buying me sweets and toys. I was grateful for the money but I still didn't speak to her. You see everyone around me, including her, acted as if I had something wrong with me. Like in was sick in the head. I can assure you I have always been fully aware of my surroundings and actions. The more you tyy to defend yourself against people, the worse people accuse you, and the worse things get, so I continued my silence.

I used the money to settle my new debts. I redid my school leaving qualifications and finally got worthwhile grades. I got my big motorbike licence and enjoyed a 2013 Suzuki bandit for a year or so... But I became depressed and felt alone again because of it all. I must have felt like I didn't earn it or something, and everyone was putting the pressure on me because of not talking and giving me dirty looks. It seemed to me like the whole city had heard shit about me... So I came off the medication and skipped the country. And everything was fine. 

I lived in Japan for five months and learned some Japanese in a school. I felt right at home since most people there are too shy to talk to each other anyway. I felt strong again. I began to speak to people. I trusted them. They were considerate of my feelings, they never did a thing to inconvenience me, and they never once hurt me. I got along with all the people I spoke to. For the first time in my life I felt at home and peaceful. Seriously, it's like they did something to instill my heart with strength.

Then when my funds started to get low I moved to a small town in northern Spain for two months and sent for my qualification certificates through the post. I planned to try and get a job in Spain. When I couldn't get one and all I had left was airfare back to the UK, I realized I would need benefits to survive.

But I didn't want to go back to my home city. I decided to go to London instead and live in hostels until I could get a job. The second I applied for benefits though the police found me and put me straight back on medication and straight back in a hospital again. For this reason I don't trust shrinks, and I don't trust the police. They can't see the truth. They don't comprehend. 

I have explained everything as calmly as I can to these people on more than one occasion. As far as they are concerned me trying to defend myself means I definitely must have schizophrenia.

I would blame my country but it couldn't be that right? It's because of my so called, friends, family, and coworkers from my hometown. The people who only pretend to care about me, and only pretend to have my best interests at heart.

Anyway after coming back, my emotions had been fortified, and because of the medication, I went on benefits... Which have turned out to be more than I ever got on a minimum wage job. That's totally not right is it...? But it's true. 

I have felt stable for the last couple of years and been doing better than ever living in a flat alone, up until about two months ago. You see, the medication I'm on has brought me a variety of negative mental and physical conditions. Depression, foggy mind, liver damage, incredibly stiff and inflexible muscles, weight gain, and high cholesterol.

Also,my mother's boyfriend had been pestering me saying if I didn't make friends or get a girlfriend I would become miserable and lonely. After a while he started to get into my head. Then one day I joined a couple of new groups on Facebook and suddenly started receiving hundreds of friend requests every day. I don't know why but when I started getting hundreds of message I thought maybe this is a good opportunity to try and find some trustworthy friends.

I fell for it again. Trusting people. I spoke to dozens of people and they all tried to scam me out of my money. One girl, from China, gained my trust by being really caring and loving, but at the same time asking me for really expensive gifts off a really specific website. And the worse part is, I actually love her because no-one has ever treated me so well. I think she'll leave me when she figures out she can't get anything else out of me.

For the past twenty four hours I have just been crying again and I'm afraid I'm going to become like I was before when I felt so lonely and cried for weeks.

Why is it that if I don't talk to people I feel strong? But when I do I can't stop crying? It's people themselves that make me feel alone and depressed, not people that help me! Is that normal?"

1mJust1mbtw,lonely,1620578291.0,I turned 18 today and i wanted to commit suicide,"Hi everyone, i’ll try to make this short.

I turned 18 today, and nobody remembered about my birthday. None of my classmates, none of my teammates. Literally nobody, cause I have nobody. Never ever had a single friend. Just one, and he turned out to be toxic for me... because of his looks, every girl that saw him instantly wanted his number, or at least stared at him. Last summer, we spent 1 month at the sea together, and i couldn’t handle it after a week, cause every time i was the ignored one. 

Now, he found a perfect girl and they’re planning to go on a cruise for 2 weeks this summer. He’s got it all. That’s exactly what i’ve always been looking for: a serious relationship with a girl i like too.

Regarding me:

I definitely don’t look good. Also because i’m rapidly balding and because i look odd

( and no, shaving it off and going to the gym is not THE solution, it needs to be accepted and it’s not easy now ). 

The only partially good thing i got is that i’m fit and tall.

I’ve tried to open up more... get to know new people... but every time, i ended up being alone anyway. Everyone is in a relationship, or has some friends... i don’t think i can go on anymore"

sirhc0223,lonely,1619863249.0,I'm(32M) in the mood to cry. Actually...I am.,"It's so strange.  I have people to talk with, to message, but I don't.  I have my own discord server with 90+ people, yet I have been gone for over a week.  I have been feeling dead, so I just sent a short message to them saying that I won't be there for at least a couple of days.  I find myself on reddit...seeking attention.  Yes, I'm not alone, but feel so lonely none the less.  I don't know what it is that I'm going through.  I guess it's because certain unfortunate things had happened with 3 people in the server that hurt a lot.  It's also not as active as I would like it to be and I've spent so much time on it.  I guess it all had drained me, although I had gotten pretty close with the people who are active.

I have gotten so good at wearing a mask and I don't even have to think about it.  I feel dead on the inside, yet I don't project it unless I get vulnerable with someone.  When I have been vulnerable with someone, they're usually gone.  I try my best to pretend that things are ok most of the time, but I want to be honest with myself.  I want to feel accepted.  I don't want to sound all chipper, when I truly want to cry.

I've finally admitted to myself about what I want and what I'm looking for.  I feel like I've been denying it and trying to run away from it.  Now that I've accepted it, I feel even more lonely, even if it's such a normal thing to want.  I want a girlfriend...to be there just for me...for us to do cute things together.  Like watch things together, read to each other, etc..  

But...I was called a bad person by someone I got close with late last year.  And all I can see myself now is a bad person.  Although everyone seems to say otherwise.  I try my best to be there for people, yet I can't seem to be there for myself.  I just want to feel loved.  But as I was having a nervous breakdown, she said I was a bad person and cut me out.  I wasn't ok before that point, and I have been worse ever since.  I was trying so hard to focus on the silver linings, because good things had occurred since then, but...It feels like more like I'm running away.  And.....Using people to cover up how I'm truly feeling.

I'm 32, yet I feel like I'm still in highschool.  Like I haven't grown up...Like I'm stuck in the past.   I don't physically look my age, my voice doesn't sound like my age, and my behaviour doesn't reflect my age either. This isn't to say that I'm immature or anything like that. It's very hard to describe. I have so many internal contradictions.  Although this isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just...feel like everything else is passing me by and I'm left behind.

I'm not looking for compliments.  I don't really take them well...I don't believe them when people say them to me.  I just want to be held and have that person say something nice to me and not ever leave.  I just want to be loved and not feel insecure.  I want someone to understand me...accept me for all of my faults.  And not leave when I'm hurting..

If anyone is thinking that I should be seeing a therapist...I am.  After what happened late last year, I made an effort to start seeing one again.  Just...Please don't say anything like that if I'm contacted.  It's triggering.  Also, I don't want to be contacted by someone acting like they have it all figured out...Again...triggering.  I don't want to feel like a lesser than.  And um...If I'm contacted, please don't suddenly talk to me well, and then gaslight and/or suddenly tell me why you won't talk with me anymore..  It has happened...It hurts and...Yeah...triggering..  

When I talk with someone new, I usually try to make them feel safe, welcomed and comfortable.  It's so strange hearing that come from me considering I have social anxiety issues, but...People think I'm outgoing when I'm not.  I did make a conscious effort to get better at using my voice, so yeah.  Anyways, I guess the way I act with people, puts me in a very vulnerable spot.  I take everyone seriously and not treat them like a joke...When...I shouldn't be expecting the same from them.  

Sorry, this ended up being longer than I expected.  I was crying throughout it.  Just sniffling now.  Thanks so much for reading this.  I was debating with myself for a few days whether I should post something here, but here I am now...doing so.  Thank you again.

P.S. If anyone wants to talk with me, I prefer to voice."

My last real relationship was 3 years ago and ever since she left I've just been feeling empty, and everytime I fail to get a relationship, not just a romantic on but just friends in general, I come up flat and sitting alone. Maybe it has something to do with me still holding my V card at 21 or maybe that im somewhat of a crazy person that rambles on for hours about conspiracy theories but I cant help it, the government is full of lizard people.

mrsaturn513,lonely,1619929517.0,"I lost my two closest friends, because they started dating each other, and I had feelings for them.","Title pretty much says all, as complicated as it sounds... or maybe it isn't. I'm not sure at this point. To be honest I felt like I should make an anonymous account for this but I guess I don't really care anymore.

So Person A (29), Person B (27), and I (25) met in an mmo 3 years ago. I've never really had any real friends before, but we ended up getting really close pretty fast. I never thought that I'd ever find anyone even remotely similar or like minded to me, never mind even feeling comfortable being myself around. We hung out with each other everyday on discord voice and played games together. I even got to finally play dnd for once instead of just hearing or reading about it... I was happy. Of course it wasn't perfect, I know nothing truly is. There were plenty of times where I would end up feeling left out with the two of them even when we did things together. My self esteem was always really low...

Still, I ended up falling in love with the both of them. Not at the same time mind, Person A was pretty much shortly after we first met. It was the first time it felt like anyone outside of my parents ever truly cared about me. So a few months later, I confessed. I was fully expecting him not to feel the same way though, and he didn't, So, It didn't hurt as much. Soon After I ""moved on"", and by that I guess my feelings ended up moving over to Person B instead. More months pass, maybe even a year, and I end up confessing to them as well. They didn't feel the same way either. I should have gotten over these feelings after but I didn't this time.

Maybe it was because I was desperate to be in a romantic relationship, since I never have been, or maybe it was something in the back of my mind telling me that I'll never find anyone else in life, especially now with covid, but I ended up stupidly holding onto these feelings hoping that maybe someday they'll change their mind. There was just something about B that I kept pining over. Almost as if they were this long lost childhood friend that I've never had. We played a lot of the same games growing up, we had similar interests and ideals, even similar experiences in life... Almost like we shared the same brain cell as some people would say. They were like me, but more outspoken... but also more abrasive... which I should have been wary of all these years.

Despite that and pushing my feelings on the backburner, The three of us still grew closer. Or so I thought. These last several months, it felt as though I was drifting away from them despite how often we hung out everyday. And to them there were a lot of topics which I expressed being okay talked about in front of and enjoyed even, but they would still only talk about it without me. There was a lot of miscommunication. It ended up leading into a huge fight between me and B in December because they were going through something, and only told A and decided to shut me out of it. Which while I do understand it's their decision on who they tell, It felt as though I wasn't needed, and it hurt... The whole time during the fight, which pretty much lasted the whole month, It felt as though Person A only wanted to be there for B.

Regardless, we still made up in the end. But it also led to me confessing my feelings again for B because of what was said in the process of reconciling. I realized that part of the hurt was because of me still being in love with them. They still didn't feel the same way. Even then I thought it'd be okay, because we were still friends and that it'd be okay that A and B were growing closer together believing that it was all purely platonic. Even if they did end up being romantically involved together I tried to convince myself that it'd be okay anyway. That Illusion all shattered in March.

I was on my way home from work when Person A had messaged me on discord telling me that he wanted to talk to me about something. He told me that he and B had been dating for the last couple of months long distance, and I lost it. I was already depressed about a lot of things at the time, and they knew that, and I didn't have the emotional capacity to handle the news. I was so heartbroken and hurt and I started bawling on the spot in my car. It hurt even more because for the last few months, I could already tell something was going on between them based on how they acted towards each other. and I felt betrayed somehow because I had also confided in A about me falling in love with B.

I couldn't be around them anymore with how they handled things. My emotions were all over the place and I couldn't think straight. The next thing I knew, I told the both of them that I hated them, I lashed out, and hurtful things were exchanged between the three of us and I left. We shut each other out. I know I could've handled the whole situation better, and I should have but I didn't. I know I didn't handle the situation well, but to be honest I don't think they handled it well either. Again, lack of communication... I wish they could have told me beforehand that they had feelings for each other so I could finally push mine aside and make way for them. I know they were trying to figure out a way to make it hurt less or so they said, but they knew that this was gonna hurt me regardless, and the outcome just hurt so much more. Especially now that they think less of me. The last thing B said to me was to get over myself about this. It cut deep.

This all feels like something I should have experienced when I was younger. And now I'm sitting here all alone while the two of them get to have the relationship I longed for... It's only been a month since everything happened and I feel empty and depressed. Like there's this gaping hole in my chest. On the worst days, I feel like I'm drowning or suffocating and trapped... Every time I think I'm over it something reminds me of our time together and I just get kicked back down again. Sometimes I even dream that I'm still hanging out with them like nothing happened. I even ran into them again in the mmo we met in because there was a new update... It fucking sucked especially since, at least from the surface, they really have moved on without me.

I don't know, maybe I just deserve all of this in the first place for not being able to be a better friend to the both of them. I highly doubt they'll see this, but if they do, I'm sorry I couldn't... At the very least, I'm glad that I was able to experience what it felt like to have friends for once. even if it didn't last. I don't think I'll ever meet anyone that I can be close to ever again, but maybe it's for the best that I don't get attached anymore. I really wish I could convince myself of that..."
RoughBrick0,lonely,1620631916.0,I have been lowering my expectations for decades,"I loathe Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day and my Birthday. I have a not so great relationship with my own mother so we just send each other cards and move on with our days. With my own family,  every single year I always have to “plan” the day with my own kids and husband or they end up saying “what should we do today” while driving in circles until I finally “suggest” something. A couple months ago, I even text my daughter and husband a picture of some cute cookies that said MOM on them in pretty pastel colors with butterflies on them, saying this is all I want for Mother’s Day is cute expensive cookies and maybe a day at the beach. What I got, my daughter saying “oh you wanted cookies or something for Mother’s Day, right?” last night and them running to the store to buy generic cookies while I was in the shower this morning and then a late lunch (no beach). Every birthday and Mother’s Day always makes me feel like complete sh!t and like nobody can be bothered to put 5 minutes of thought into anything. I lower and lower my expectations every year (and I’m 44 with a 16 and 11 year old), to the point that just some personalized cookies actually excited me and they couldn’t even do that. I end up feeling lonely and like nobody truly gives a crap about me on these types of holidays. It’s tough feeling lonely and useless and pretending to be fine."
LettuceLucky,lonely,1620233745.0,I'm scared of losing my friends and don't know what to do," Hey guys!

I've been struggling with the thought of losing my (only) group of friends. It's going to be a little long so there's going to de a TL;DR at the end.

During high school I spent pretty much every single moment with this group (btw, we are five 19F right now) but now I'm starting to feel like I've grown out of them. Or that they have grown out of me. I don't know.

Last year, in March, we started uni. We were still close, not seeing each other very often because of a very long lockdown our country had, but we spoke regulary on the group chat, we watched movies together, played games, etc.

Everything was going pretty well until around July. Like I said, my country had a very long lockdown. My mental health started to suffer, and, as a consequence, my academic performance. (I forgot to mention, but I have a very important scholarship for the best engineering school in my country. The rest of my friends go to the public and free uni and study non-STEM degrees. I have to do really well in school in order to keep my scholarship). I was thinking of dropping out of school. I thought I wasn't as smart as everybody thinks I am. I was also suffering from Imposter Symdrome, I didn't think that I deserved that scholarship.

This went on for a couple of months. At this point, lockdown wasn't as strict as it was before so I met up with my friends a couple of times but I never mentioned this. Like I said, I didn't want people to know I was struggling. Only my parents knew. I've always struggled to communicate when I'm feeling bad.

Around october, I decided to change. I started taking my studies more seriously and I actually ended up doing a lot better in school. This year, so far, I'm doing way better and no longer paying attention to feeling inadequate. I'm very happy with how I'm doing in uni this year.

This improvement was made possible by studying a lot. Like 10-14 hours everyday. This led me to be pretty isolated, I spent the whole summer studying hard for my finals (which were around february) and I did really well. Because of this, I obviously didn't have time to meet up with my friends or play games with them. They didn't have finals around that time, so they were free to do whatever they wanted.

Flashfoward to a couple of weeks ago. I had exams, so I've studying like crazy. Nailed them. But as soon as I finished them I realized something: the group chat hasn't been used in weeks. I was very happy with my grades, especially knowing how bad I was a year ago, thinking about dropping out. But then I realized that I had no one (but my parents) to share this. I was completly alone. The thought of having no one to share what was making me happy made me very sad.

When I realized that, I sent a message to the group chat telling them that we haven't done anything together in a while and I'd be fun to do something (not IRL, my country is -again- in lockdown). They said yes and we decided to watch a movie that night. However, when the night came, no one was connected. I'd understand if they couldn't make it., but they had literally said that they could a couple of hours ago. I don't really understand with that happened.

Since then, I haven't really talked to them. Sometimes I answer their Instagram Stories, but I don't really have a lot of connection with them.

I forgot to mention, but everytime we talk they know everything about each other. They know what's going on with each others life. I'm clearly not part of those conversations. But they are private, so it's their decision to choose with whom they want to share their lifes. It's totally undestandable and I'm sorry I can't have the social skill required to look (and be) more helpful. I'd love to be the kind of friend that you go to when something good or bad happens in your life.

I know that our lives are changing. But I just don't know what to do. I don't blame them for anything. If it's someone's fault, it's mine. One of them got a boyfriend, another got a job. I get that they are busy and it's perfect. I'm really happy that they are having a good life. I don't really think I deserve them, they are too good for me (I mean, last year I was struggling but that is not a excuse to stop talking to them. I know my past actions were wrong and I'm deeply sorry if I caused them pain. Wish I could turn back time, but I can't). I just really miss them.

Since I realized how wrong I was, I've been feeling pretty dull the time. I'm still focusing on school. I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have friends on school (it's hard for me to make friends in online uni, if anyone's got advice PLEASE tell me). It's just that they were a very important part of my life, so everything reminds me of them. My favorite youtuber? One of them introduced me to her channel. My favorite tv show? One of them and I would talk for hours about that show. There's a lot of examples like these ones.

I keep thinking about this quote from the movie ""Her"": I'll always love you 'cause we grew up together and you helped make me who I am. I just wanted you to know there will be a piece of you in me always, and I'm grateful for that.

I'm very happy that they are having great lifes now. I just wish I was involved. I love them and miss them. And thinking that everything was my own fault makes me hate myself. I lost relatives, I lost friends, but I've never felt this bad before. I'm sad all the time.

I don't know what to do. I mean I tried to plan something and they didn't show up. I don't know if I should try to heal and forget about them or if I should keep trying to talk to them.

Anyway, if you read all of this thank you so much.

TD;DR: Struggled with mental health and school last year. Made a decision of doing really well in school. Studied a lot and I'm pretty good academically now. But in the progress I've noticed how my group of friends is starting to fade."

Deception.

I become a fool and lose myself in hopes of getting something.

End up disappointed.

Maybe just a friendship. Just chat? No.

I just have to laugh at myself for being a fool.

Kindly_Pressure_51,lonely,1620488774.0,My loneliness prob,"So, I was lonely like 90% of my day ( not literally but mostly), it is not bad, I get a hecka lot of great ideas and looking forward to do it (as now is lockdown, I'm in India, mind you) and how do I get it? Easy, by talking to myself, again this mechanism is very helpful if done correctly and it helped me a lot on many things (also some harm...) but... the real problem is, whenever I was thinking deeply on my loneliness, the THOUGHT just comes up, I.e ""I'm lonely"" and that just struck me, even though this is a lockdown, you know it just struck me, Any ideas on what to do, advise accepted (I will sure do my own research of course)?"

But the thought of doing that makes me feel sick and frightened. So instead I just stay inside another day where I don't have to deal with the stress and responsibilities and inevitable bullshit that comes with meeting new people.

Xeno-Bound,lonely,1620473068.0,My fear of abandonment,"I’m always afraid of people abandoning me, even if the fear isn’t entirely rational. My mind is always telling me things like “they don’t really like you” or “they prefer to be with others and not you” and it makes me scared. 

I’ve had this fear for a while now, but I think it became fully realized a few months ago, when I was actually abandoned. I had a romantic partner, and we both fell each other very hard. He made me feel loved, and worthy of being loved. My self esteem grew, I felt happier. However, one day, he stated that he no longer had feelings for me, and it was almost out of the blue. It was devastating. After all of the time we spent together, he just threw it all away. Now, we barely talk because of his busy schedule, and he spends time with other friends. It makes me feel discarded. 

These feelings of fear and loneliness have become so bad, it’s starting to have a negative impact on my friendships. I don’t want to be controlling or anything, but the thoughts and fears won’t go away. I feel like I’m being tortured while also being an asshole, and I don’t want to be either. I want this nightmare to end. 

Don’t know how many people will read this, but if you did, thank you for at least spending some of your time listening to me ramble. I just needed to get it off of my chest."
soratakanashi,lonely,1620448887.0,So lonely that I just want to give up,"I'm 24 as of a few days ago and I'm extremely lonely or at least it feels like it. I don't have any friends in real life and I haven't since I graduated high school 5 years ago. I've never had a group of friends, I've never held a girls hand before, and I've never even had a girlfriend before.  For a long time it didn't bother me. I was happy in my own little world playing games and watching anime but now the things I used to love don't bring me anything anymore. I have no one to share my accomplishments. I have no one to watch things with or talk about how work was or anything. 

Last year I met someone who changed how I viewed everything and she was my best friend. We played games together every night, they always asked how I was and asked me to watch stuff. For a whole year I felt what it was like to have someone be into you but a month ago they met someone new. They turn down all my invitations to hang out, they don't message me anymore or even reply to me. I see them online every night playing the games I got her into and taught her how to play together and I can't even get a response from someone who I called my bestfriend and I'm heartbroken. I was there for this person whenever they needed it and I'm just thrown to the side like trash..

Right now I just go to work and come home right after and play games or watch movies or anime by myself. I only have one friend I can play games with and our schedules make it hard to even do that. I browse reddit looking for friends to make now. I message people and I just get ignored. I add people on discord and I'm left on read majority of the time.. I ask people to hang out and it's always maybe or ignored. I've tried bumble and tinder and deleted both too. I feel like a fucking ghost and I'm constantly wondering what's wrong with me. I have so many thoughts about ending myself every day and night it feels normal now. Part of me wishes I could die so I wouldn't have to be so lonely and more but the other part of me wants to know what it feels like to be normal and have a life but I'm just getting older and things are getting worse every year."

I miss having my dog(Delilah) sleeping by my feet at night. I’m getting her ashes today and it brought forth a mess of emotions. I thought about how alone I am without either of them. I’ve been depressed for years and it pushed my girlfriend away. She also has depression and I just stopped trying to help her and we just lived depressed together. I thought of breaking up with her constantly considering she might of been the issue. But when she broke up with me all I wanted was her back. Then she slept with someone in our apartment while we were still living together. That sent me over the deep end but for some reason I wasn’t mad at her. I still wanted her in my life but I was extremely upset. Then I moved out immediately. Keeping my name on the lease so she doesn’t get kicked out. Then a few months later my worst fear came true and I had to say goodbye to Delilah. It was the saddest moment of my life and I just wish she could of lived healthfully with me forever. I feel like a mess and don’t know why everything is hitting me at once. But most of the time now I just feel alone.

It's frustrating. I keep being told it's where I was raised, my formative years being in Europe and despite on military bases, the exposure had a huge influence and living in the USA for nearly 20 years....I still feel alien.

37, crushing on a 21 year old that I've been trying to distance myself from (give me flack if you want, he's an amazing person who has no interest in me besides getting attention when he wants), few friendships that end up fading away, acquaintanceships that never get anywhete coz they are one sided, depression that had been really tough to trek through lately...mixed with anhedonia that I've been able to slowly pull myself out of...but  my personality has been stripped due to this.

I feel suspended. Lonely, alone surrounded by people. Really wanting companionship. 

But i digress. Apologies in advance, i just really needed to dump this somewhere."

""tHeRe'S mORe tO LiFe tHaN sEx aNd DaTiNg"" - even though sex and dating are basic normal part of human life that almost everyone experiences at some point and sex is considered one of the most enjoyable things one can experience. many people who say this are sexually active themselves or are virgins by choice. Some of them have said they won't date a virgin because they don't have the patience to teach someone and just want good sex instantly and they have the audacity to tell a forever alone person it's no big deal and they should be patient. how ironic and hypocritical!

""tHeRe'S mOrE tO LiFe tHaN SoCiALiZiNg"" - even though humans are social creatures and the fact that everyone went insane and depressed under quarantine says it all.

""tHeSe eVeNtS aReN'T tHaT FuN"" - they are talking about bars and parties and music concerts etc where people socialize and have fun. while these things might not be fun for introverts, for an extrovert they're very fun. The fact that people always go to these social events often and do it in their free time and the fact that people throw parties to celebrate things kinda says it all. at least let these socially isolated people try these events rather than simply tell them ""iT'S nOt tHaT fUn"". ***just because one person won't like these events doesn't mean others cannot enjoy it. just keep that in mind before you say that you tried it and hated it.***

People just trivialize your problems and teach you comforting lies. instead of helping you find friends, find a date, find a fun event to go to, they trivialize your problems. instead of teaching you how to make friends or date, they show no empathy at all. if they helped us find someone to be friends or significant other with or how to find a fun event to go to and taught us how to do this, maybe then we would be able to get help and solve our issues."

PekoPekoyamasSword,lonely,1620323836.0,My classmates isolate me and I hate it,"I feel like everyone hates me

Due to me still being a minor and that I live in the Uk, I still go to a fucking mess of a school. My entire class seems to isolate me and I occasionally hear them talking about me, though I don’t know what they are saying about me. Whenever we put out of our seating positions, my class sits on every table that isn’t the one I sit at. Apparently some of my classmates are actually somewhat scared of me, though I’m unsure of why. Hell, someone made a school-shooting joke and someone else said that if anyone were to commit a school-shooting, it would be me. The only thing my class knows me for is my hate for a certain boy in our class who has been bullying me for three years straight. I have never really had a full conversation with anyone in my class and I am physically harassed almost every day by the boy who I previously mentioned. He has punched me, kicked me, pushed me and decided to hit me in the head with a pencil case today. Whenever I decide to get back at him, he acts like the victim and gets away with all of the shit he’s done to me. He has sprayed hand sanitiser in my eyes twice and has hit me in the knees with a baseball bat in just this week alone. My class either mock me or act like I don’t exist. Whenever I try to say something, someone tells me to shut up. They then ask why I never talk. I feel like an object in my class. I don’t show emotion nor speak in my class unless it’s absolutely necessary. My class is incredibly overwhelming to be in and due to me getting stressed very easily by things such as loud noises, I have had many panic attacks induced by my class being way too chaotic. I hate them all so much. I used to want to form some kind of acquaintanceship with at least one classmate, though I no longer feel a need to do so. I have gotten used to being alone in that fucking classroom. I feel disconnected whenever I’m with my classmates."

Ikbenderooknog,lonely,1620079916.0,Chaotic mind (16M),"I have friends, but I don't see them that often. I also have a huge crush on a girl in my school, since I was 12. I WANT to see my friends more irl, but going outside is already a heavy burden for me, my motivation is just too low. But I have also grown weary of being at home all day and seeing my family whenever I come out of my room. And today my PC (which is my best friend at home) kinda broke down. Something that makes me terribly anxious, for many documents are stored in that computer, just as my games.
 When such nasty things occur, my daydreaming skill comes to life and suddenly that feeling that I don't matter and that nobody loves me hits me in the face. Beside my family, no one showed love to me in years. This is also what I am feeling rn and the feeling just wont disappear, even though I am looking for  distraction in fun YouTube video's.
When I feel like this, I just want to cry, as a last try to get rid of it, but I can't cry. Like i just CAN'T. It is like I am not in the right mood to cry I guess. I think I am emotionless anyway, I can't remember the last time I knew what emotion I felt. 

Can someone say something to clarify my situation? Am I numb?

khvacant,lonely,1620007650.0,Waves of Loneliness,"(19M) I kinda wanna explain my circumstances and give background first:  

I’ll start with the past which will be part of high school and then bring it around to the present:  In 12th grade I got into my first relationship, but that all fell apart around this time last year.  All my flaws were basically pointed out to me and I was left an anxious, insecure mess.   I ran track back in high school and I actually knew a good amount of people, but I felt super alone and messed up after the break up, and really didn’t talk to anybody.  I didn’t have any goals or a sense of purpose, shit just wasn’t going good.  Other than being at the gym or the job I was at, I was in my room embodying the phrase “down bad” 😂.  COVID was in its prime so that only made things worse. 

(For more context my father passed away in the midst of things me really becoming a man and starting to have those struggles.  I have uncles to go to and what not but that comfortable figure to go to for guidance isn’t there anymore, which is probably a major reason why I’m on here)


From there on, I’ve been in situations where anxiety kicked my ass.  I realized a few things, a major one being that I really just gotta be myself and not put on some type of facade.  Point is, I began to understand a lot of the basic sentiments that are preached to people all the time.  

 Before this past year of college I knew I wanted stuff to change.  I began reflecting on myself and started doing things like no fap, meditation, cold showers, this that and the third.  In all this, I even discovered my passion for creating, and got into videography, photography, and things of that nature.  The only thing was that for the most part this school year, I was pretty much alone like I was in the summer.  I’m in a MUCH better headspace than I was then, and I’ve grown to be fine with being alone (that definitely can depend though).  It’s also not like I can’t have a conversation with anyone, and I’m definitely confident in my looks (idk how relevant that may be, but it’s just a perspective showing where my head is at). 

Here’s my point: Sometimes I’m just like “damn, I’m really alone in this shit”.  I start to think back to how I had that one person everyday just to talk to whom I genuinely was interested in.  I begin to think about how i’m at college and how it seems as if everyone is enjoying a great social life but me.  Even regular “guy talk” makes me semi-uncomfortable now because I haven’t really had experiences ever, let alone in college.  Just makes me feel more out of place 

Though I have been improving  myself I’ve just felt disconnected, and as if I need something more.  I’ve been really working on my passion and doing things with that, and I’m going to be working this summer too.  I’m just wondering if you guys have any advice on how I should proceed, and maybe tips on what to do if I start to feel down like I am right now.  
I can’t help but wonder if I’m on the right path or if I should be doing things differently"
SomeForgettableGuy,lonely,1620329417.0,I want to love someone,"I want to love someone, I have never been in love before. I feel very empty in my life, I don't do anything and don't want to do anything but I feel like if I had someone else there with me then things wouldn't be so bad. 

I'm fine most of the time but every few days I am reminded of how alone I am and it makes me really sad. 

I've never loved anyone before, and don't have family that loves me so I don't get any love and haven't felt loved in so long. 

All the women I've ever tried to get to know and date all chose another man over me, some even lead me on only to drop me so they can go off and fuck another man that is apparently better than me, which makes me sad. 

I want to feel special and like people care about me. I want to have someone in my life that makes me smile, someone that I want to do good things for, but instead all I get is a world seemingly full of judgemental assholes. Even the ""nice"" people end up seeming fake, and I don't know what to do, and don't want to feel so alone anymore. Everything would be so much easier if I could just meet someone...but the odds of that happening are almost zero...any women I meet won't like me. I can give them what they'd want from a partner, I'm not fun, I have no ambitions or motivation, and I think the world is shit. 

I know there are women that attach themselves to men like me, but they won't ever try to get to know me, because unlike the guys they choose over me, I won't verbally and physically abuse them. This isn't hyperbole, I've actually been considered lesser to an abuser...guess I just can't evoke any of the proper emotions in women, and will just be alone forever because I'm not attractive or interesting. Makes me sad."

Hirohito18,lonely,1620513296.0,Is it weird that I do not have serious relationships with others?,"Alright, so I am a 21 years-old guy at the university. I dont consider myself handsome neither ugly, somewhere a bit below the avarage look (I am skinny plus I have a slight scoliosis)

I am at the university since 2018 (it's a 6 years-long program) and I realized that I don't have any serious relationship with others, I only have acquaintances; we usually talk about school or 1-2 common thing but thats all, nothing serious or more  involving

Is it normal? I mean, I am usually the guy who scores straight A's at most of the subjects, therefore a lot of people tries to take advantage of me (asking my class notes) but I usually sort these peope out quickly, and after that, I usually have like 10 acquaintances. 

Lmao, I am still a virgin, haven't have a girlfriend before, and to be honest, I dont really want a girlfriend. It would be a nuisance for me, plus I would feel myself limited and I would be forced to reorganize my time managment, which is a sensitive field (I like to work hard, but I also have a lot of ""me-time"", which I like to spend alone, doing my hobbies, like playing with video games or watching some sci-fi series)

Is it weird? Sometimes (really rarely) I have a sort if ""outcast"" feeling, if I could not fit in into society. Others describe me as an introverted, self-contained guy, but idk what to do about this. Naturally, I dont tell everything about me or about my life to everyone that I know, because I found it as a weakness: telling these things to others could harm you in a long term."

ExtremussPrime,lonely,1620248328.0,Got replaced and I'm depressed,"My best friend replaced me with her new classmates (and one in particular), so we barely played together. She spent a lot of time and continues to, with that classmate.
We were kinda best friends, duo at League of Legends, spent the whole day together playing or doing other things. And now she does those things with him, and me, 'have to be alright with that'.
We fought this past Saturday, because we were finally going to play a bit, told her to get in a call with me but she told she was already in a call with that people. In that moment I felt really bad, so told her I wasn't going to play and got out of the game. Then she texted me that I always say 'we don't play together anymore' and made fun of it. Told her to go back to her new friends and then she got mad, and wanted to end the friendship and stuff.
The moment she started that class, she changed for worst, ""I'm busy all day"", stopped texting me first, barely replied back with a few words.
I feel like shit. Told her I didn't wanted things to end, I entered a state of toxicity where I kept texting her and she ignores me. Last night told me if I keep texting a lot and with that kind of content, she'll block me.
So, here I am, trying to control me, lonely and depressed. I barely got any sleep since this past Saturday (5 days).
If anyone replies to this, probably will say that I have to move on, she's not worth it or things like that. You'll be right, but I don't want things to end, and not like this.

I'm those that have to text first or only text you when they need something. Lost friends because of different reasons, so kept getting alone over time, and I was ok with that, but not with her.

I don't expect for anyone to have a magic answer or something like that. Just wanted to vent, because I don't have anyone to talk about this, and if I had, they weren't going to be interested in.
I do have 3 mutual friends that told me to give up and stop insisting, but they didn't had this connection and don't understand it completely.

Juice-Leia,lonely,1620516066.0,My attempt at “getting out there” today,"Today was Saturday so I was off work. As usual I had nothing to do and felt awful most of the day.

I found a small local pickleball event and decided to go. It was on the other side of town and there was lots of traffic. I felt kind of nervous but forced myself to keep driving there.

When I got there I approached the wrong group of people: Me: “Hi, are you from the app?” Her: “No...”

It was the other group of people on the courts. Well it turns out everyone there was 30s and 40s at the youngest and like 60 at the oldest.

I hadn’t played pickleball in about 8 years so I wasn’t very good. We played doubles and I sucked. I also didn’t understand the scoring at all or how taking turns serving works. It was awkward af.

After a handful of games some other players were saying they were going to head out. I wanted to leave too but wasn’t sure how. I just kept standing around trying to figure out how to get the hell out of there. Finally I waved and said “nice meeting you” and left.

So that was my experience today trying to “go outside” as is recommended for lonely people. On the positive side I got some exercise and did feel better than before. On the negative it was so awkward and none of these people are my age.

Overall I tried but still feel like I’m back at stupid square one. I don’t get how normal people have so many friends and exciting things going on whenever I try to go out and meet people it’s so mediocre."

some days i feel so alone that I don’t know how to handle it anymore.
now, my question is, does anyone have any tips on how to become more content with being on your own? how did you learn to accept that being alone is okay too, how did you learn to love yourself & have fun with yourself?

kawaiigirlUwU68,lonely,1620524364.0,Never feeling lonely.,"21F here. So i have aspergers and add (not sure if related). I had one super duper close friend and i still do and she is my cousin.
My parents were always concerned how i never showed interest in communicating with other people but didn’t do anything about it. 

I dont know whats wrong with me but everyone says that im weird for not having friends or talking to people, especially my cousin. My parents and cousin say its gonna be really hard for me in the adult world with no friends, but i dont want to have friends just to use them for help. 

I have never had any friends i kept for longer than a few months, they would always tell me i was weird and drop me. 

I knew i was ugly and had bad posture and i was bullied for that but i fixed both issues,but the only people who communicated with me were the ones who were looking for a relationship which i ended up going along with because i liked them but after breakups i would get dropped by them.

Now so far this might be sounding pretty incel to you, but my problem isn’t that i’m single it’s because for some reason I don’t get lonely or want friends and i don’t know how to fit in when i’m all alone all the time. My family and their friends always comment on me not being social with them or anyone else. And i hate it, because everyone sees me not being social or having friends as problematic or concerning.

I am concerned on how i am going to live in the adult world with no friends while i don’t wanna be forced to make some. Will i one day regret having them if i do?

I know this is posted in the lonely sub but there literally is no sub for non-lonely people :(."

marvelmami,lonely,1620007878.0,I’m just depressed all the time,"Sometimes I’ll just be doing school work then I’ll ask myself why I even bother doing it because I most likely won’t even make it out of college. I don’t see a future for myself besides working, and it won’t even be to support anyone but myself. I’m 19 and have never had a boyfriend or an almost lover and I’ll never find one. Im undesirable and too much of a loner to keep someone happy anyways. I would feel guilty if I dated someone because I know they would deserve someone better. 

And since I won’t ever have a partner, it’ll be pretty hard to raise kids which is really all I want to do in life. All I’ve ever wanted to be is a mom. But I don’t want to ruin them either. I feel like I ruin everyone in my path because I’m never happy and it shows. Why can’t I just enjoy life? Why can’t I dream of a future 10 years from now without reminding myself that I probably won’t make it that far anyways?

I’m just sick of never feeling happiness. I’m sick of being alone in this. I don’t have a best friend anymore and I never realized just how much having one helps until I lost her. I’m not anybody’s number one choice and I never will be. So why should I continue on? There’s no one who needs me.

Everything's bottled up inside me for 2-3 years now, and I've also been unable to cry. I have always been the kind of person who always tried being there for others, making sure they were fine. I was the kind of person who said ""Eh suicide is a foolish thing to think of"", but right now I'm contemplating the possibility of one. I'm not happy. I wish I could be happy.

I think I just need to be myself more, start acting like the teenager I am and just try to have fun in life. But I’m being held back. I’ve began to realize that my mother has a problem with letting me grow up. I can’t be myself around her. I still have to act like an innocent little girl when I want to be a confident fun woman. I want to love myself. It all just hurt. I’ve been feeling lonely for so long and it only seems to be getting worse no matter how hard I try. I feel like I’ll always just be that loser with no friends. I feel like I won’t be about to make long lasting relationships with people, if I’m even able to talk to them in the first place. Whenever I do meet someone who my mom would approve of, I end up not really clicking with them because it’s just not the real me. I’m the type of person who wants to make mistakes and have fun and make memories. I want to enjoy my life.

,lonely,1620053531.0,Lonely without an idea how to change it.,"Hey other lonely people, I've got to this very desperate point in my life where i feel more lonely than ever and by a long shot. I know what the other side is like, been deep in the sauce not having enough time for everyone, yet I'm just as far down to scale just the opposite end.

To give some context i used to work and that's all I did, 5 days a week, 8h+ a day always talking to people and interacting, coworkers as well as customers.
I was completely spent by the time my days came up and i spent it sitting in my room smoking weed and playing video games. The classics, not joining my friends for nights out because I was too tired, never making plans.

Eventually I couldn't keep it up and quit my job a couple months after covid started in effort to try enjoy my life a little but this step was the first to my issue spiraling out of control. Due to lockdown and restrictions i couldn't see my friends anyways if i wanted to make plans. I wasn't seeing my coworkers or keeping myself busy with work. I was cruising and relaxing after 3+ years of non-stop work.

To top it off i moved back with my parents as well, no free house to invite who i want. I was in contact with a friend who moved away, also was in a similar situation at the time but eventually they were able to go back to work as restrictions are eased in his country.
We used to talk every day and play video games, we had each other at least. Since he left i just have a void in me, he was the only person still close to me.

My parents and i are ok but they don't really interact with me if that makes sense, i stay in my room lonely and sad and they don't really come to me. I feel like they just gave up on me / don't really care, even though I think they do I'm just not sure why they don't put effort into showing it.

I don't live in my home country, been here since I'm 6 and I'm 25 now. I don't speak the native language 100% as i went to an international school and i feel like an outsider, even though everyone speaks English here and i can speak somewhat of the local language.

I really don't know what to do, I feel completely alone, none of my ""friends"" and family approach me to interact, i don't see any future for myself, I'm just stuck in the hole for the first time in my life, and unfortunately it's a huge hole so i don't know what now.

If anyone has some sort of advice i would love to hear it, I'm very desperate at this point :/"

NoAdministration2951,lonely,1619983074.0,Am I lonely or depressed or ugly ?," 

Hey people.

I work in a Bank in India. I don't have anyone to hang out with on weekends - am getting very lonely. I tried getting close with people in office but it isn't working. Like I can talk and maintain a good rapport there, but a plan to meet outside of work simply doesn't happen.

Its been 1 year me working there now. Outside office, my pg friends left for hometown last year itself. Then I took a flat and now am completely alone. Neighbours are all live-in couples, just to add to the loneliness feeling.

Due to covid there is no scope for any other way of meeting people. Also I accept that chances are less regardless. I tried dating apps but am skinny guy so chances are very low, I never get a match.

Due to covid the roads are mostly empty. But the area I live in I can see couples all around - it just reminds me how ugly I am.

I cry on weekends in my flat alone. Financially I am a mess. Savings are nil - if I'm fired tomorrow my whole life will be a mess.

I dont know what my problem is - Loneliness / Depression or am I just so ugly.

I feel i'm inching closer to suicide every day.

Please advise."

I have a problem of anxiety and panic attacks with 2 years history. So pretty much the same feeling every.

It just sneaks up on you in a way. Life has completely changed for me in the last 2 years. I wish I had my old life back. I guess this is how people end up dying unnoticed in their homes. Well at least isolated men don’t live as long, so there’s that I suppose."

VioletShadow138,lonely,1619996597.0,"Pushing 40, living alone and single for the first time ever...here is a short snapshot of my life","I don't know how to do this. Being alone...all the time... I didn't grow up right, I was in an AWFUL, abusive, cult-like church growing up and stayed with terrible people in one long-term relationship after another for many years because I just didn't know how to function when I left high school. I gave up on organized religion many years ago and partied my 20s and most of my 30s away...being a musician in many different bands and gigging around bars/clubs/parties/venues/etc. There absolutely IS such a thing as the wrong crowd. And all the while I was with someone who cheated on me, disrespected me, and used me up for nearly 15 years. I had no self worth. But COVID times tore it all up, he went off to live with the singer of my former band, and I was left in my home jobless, injured and ill for the winter. I lost many people I thought were friends and was unable to recoup friendships I thought I had before that relationship. For 6 months AFTER the breakup last year, I was quarantined with both of them in my own home, and when they finally moved out with each other, the INTENSE, screaming-at-the-wind kind of gut-wrenching loneliness kicked in. 

I have never felt this way before. I have immediate family, a handful of friends, and one married best friend I am in love with, which further complicates my life. I try to play video games and music to ease the pain, but then something will trigger me and next thing I know I am screaming into a pillow and sobbing on the floor for hours. I have never been loved the ""right"" way, whatever the hell that means.  

I still have no job over a year later despite my best efforts. I don't have a band to play in and socialize...I don't know how to connect to people properly unless music is involved. I have never felt this alone in my life, even though I have a small handful of people I am SO thankful for who are rooting for me. 

If you read to the bottom, congrats and thank you for your time. I needed to vent and talk about some of this, so thanks for listening."

dmank007,lonely,1620188594.0,"Each individual’s perception of reality is unique, and nobody will ever have the opportunity to see the beauty of the world through each others eyes.","I am going to write this in first person because it is simpler to write that way, but please interpret this as an observation regarding each individual person on the planet.

I was born, i was raised, and I have had thousands (if not millions) of unique experiences that shape the way i think and perceive reality around me. People are inherently selfish and think about themselves; not a single person (except for my father) in my entire life has truly given half a shit about me. This leads me to the realization that when I die, all of my experiences and wisdom that I gained throughout this existence will die with me.  No one will be able to live what i lived through, and those who come after me will never be able to learn from the mistakes i made, leading them to unnecessary pain and suffering.

No one will ever ask me “hey xxxx, what do you think about this philosophical issue?” Or “hey xxxx, what’s your viewpoint on yyyy.”  People always want to talk about themselves and never leave room for the other person to insert their knowledge or potential expertise into a situation unless it benefits them in some way.

Therefore, when i or another person dies, we have a  grossly inefficient transfer of knowledge simply due to our inherent selfishness, and this makes the world a darker place.  And the understanding of this concept (at least through my eyes) is lonely as fuck.


POV you’re a fast food employee: 

Me: “I’ll have a large shamrock shake with fries.  And no, I don’t give a fuck if it’s St. Patty’s day or not.  Just dye my milkshake green and we’ll pretend like everything’s okay.”

You: “Sir, this is a Wendy’s.”

Now granted we've only hung out once or twice, but I had a really good time when we did. We never set a time but he woke up around 3, I told him I was about to start cooking. Messaged him at 4:30 to tell him I was wrapping up. He said he had to clean up, take a shower and grab beer. It is now 7 and I haven't heard from him. I saw his location was on and he wasn't even home, he was downtown. 


Even if he does end up coming over at this point, I'm not even really feeling it. I was excited for him to eat the food hot and fresh (out the kitchen). Am I being too clingy by being upset? He's probably just busy, right...? Well, I roasted an entire chicken, salmon, made tons of vegetables and mashed potato's and used the rest of my salad mix. At least I won't go hungry over it."

I love my family but their stupid mistakes pull me down and no matter what I do to teach them  they keep depending on me. I always do my best to make them happy but i am always stressed being the one pulling them all together.

As much as I try not to listen, my friends comments make sense to me because they have been through  a lot of things and they are so far ahead on their careers than me. 

I do excel at my work but It's hard to maintain that good streak so I end up slacking off sometimes and then I become mediocre.

I always feel that I am fat, and ugly and i got so jaded that I find it hard to trust peoples intentions that leads to me finding it hard to get into a relationship. 

I don't even want to get into serious relationships anymore because I have my family relying on me to do well for them and I cannot afford relationships anymore. 

I keep showing people that I am strong because I am currently managing a lot of people at work and that showing them weakness gets to cause them losing  respect towards me. 

Leading a bunch of people to do well at work, managing their performance makes me a kind of motivator when I myself am not.

kferrero,lonely,1619920389.0,Can Anyone Relate To..,"Hi there,

I’m quite new to Reddit. I found this community and I guess I’m just looking for affirmation that I’m not the only one who feels the way I do regarding my social life. I’m 23, and as far as I can remember, I have struggled to make close connections. I also have never been in a relationship. I’m not sure if it’s because I can be socially awkward or anxious at times, or if it is also based on my circumstances. The majority of my grade school experience was a very small, private school. Besides the small selection of people in my grade, I was also shy and considered the perfectionist or the teacher’s pet. I went to three different high schools from 9th-12th and barely had the chance to settle. I’m finishing up college, and I go to my local university. I transferred out-of-state because I felt like I’d have better social and educational opportunity elsewhere, but due to medical issues had to return to my hometown. I’ve never had the financial means of living on-campus, so many times I’d take the hour drive from my family’s home to and from campus. I finally decided my junior year to use the money I had saved up to move out and live close to campus, but the pandemic hit and so my dreams of making new connections came somewhat to a halt. Since I moved out, I have lived in four different apartments due to short-term leases and financial reasons. I believe I am a friendly person, but I think the volatility of my living situations and locations has made socializing difficult. I do not have a car either, so I usually walk or take the bus around. I have joined various groups on campus when I could, but never got too far besides an acquittance to anyone within those clubs. I have also joined dating apps with minimal expectations in order to meet up with people, but many times I am ghosted or it seems like people do not want to meet up in real life. I’m curious if anyone can relate and could offer any advice. I'm very open to listening. What could I be doing wrong?"

Then one day I come home to empty house and a letter about how she wants to be independent and prove she can live on her own, she wants all this spiritual quiet and escape from everyone and just a lot of selfish things. Okay we smoothed it over the next got things off our chest and agreed hey this is gonna be great and be better for us and over the past 3 months she gets farther and farther away.  She is a very aggressive hi strung person and still even living separately everything pisses her off and even me on my usual loving hey I miss you text would create friction because she wants everyone to leave her alone and she is so tired of the phone ringing. (Yes she has a busy phone because of work). Sooo here is is the night befoe a month since I have seen her and week since I text her.  I tried to get together but her girlfriends are more important and even lunch FaceTime dates got ruined because of something she is doing and the one person who has been there and loved her so much after being beat down (mental and word abuse) still right here. Idk what I did because damn did I try and out a lot of weight on my shoulders to see her smile and she never smiled, it was always something to complain or scream about.  I’m tired of sitting around waiting for my phone to go off and disappointed every time it’s everything but her,  this past week a buddy said hey man wanna go up to the farm,  shoot guns and fix the Cadillac and instant idk what to do anxiety rushed because yes I do but what if she calls and says hey me and the kiddos are... do you wanna come.   Guess what? I bailed and guess who didn’t call or anything.  Yeah. After listening to a lot of Gaia, YouTube videos I realized I can’t let someone have that much power over me. If I keep living in the past. (This date in memory photos) I can’t move forward as my brain is stuck in that pattern. My lease is up in July and god damn it I’m moving an hour away. (Closer to my job) found me a one bedroom apartment because well nobody can live with me and I’m gonna force my self to get comfortable being alone and not in a negative way but in a good way to love my self and not be so co dependent. 

But tonight I’m lonely,  I can’t stop wondering where and what did i do and go wrong and actually can come up with nothing when any other time I can list things where I went wrong cuz I blame it all on me so I don’t think I’m wrong and truly believe this is a situation of their loss and have been talking to my self like a buddy would talk or I would talk to a buddy. 

So come July 21 people can just come to my little ass apartment and we won’t have to be lonely!  Parrrrrty."

tupsybee,lonely,1620597389.0,I am so unimportant,"

Ever since I left school and everyone went off into the “real world” I’ve realised how unimportant I am to everyone who isn’t my family. I know I shouldn’t be selfish and by no means to I expect my friends to make me their number one priority, however seeing how much effort I put in vs how little effort they put in has made me realise I don’t hold the same place in their life as they hold in my life. I saw someone else say this a while back, but it’s like they’re main characters in my life and I’m just a side character to them. They’ve all made tons of new friends and have so many people around them whilst I only have them. I understand that people grow apart naturally and you’re not always gonna be as close but it’s so hard to watch them flourish whilst I am so alone. I tried so hard to make new friends but it never works, I thought I’d made a new friend recently but he recently told me that he can’t be bothered to talk to me anymore. Just like that those few months of building a new friendship were gone. I know it’s my own fault for letting him become so important in my life but wow it’s hurts to be told that. 

I just wish someone would see me as important, in the same way I see them as important. Like right now, if i disappeared the few people I call friends probably wouldn’t even notice 😞"

This pandemic only showed what I knew since I was a kid: humanity got completely wrong. Human beings are the worst specie ever: selfish, listless, mean and completely greedy. It’s been more than a year since I am facing delicate issues, especially financial ones. Guess what ? Nobody never gave a fuck. The most ppl say is “I’m so sorry” or “It must be tough, buddy”. And that was all I got from ppl. Meanwhile I am being exposed to all kinds of humiliation since 3/2020, going through needs, completely indebted, unhappy, hopeless. “Oh I care about you” they say. No you don’t. All y’all do is exactly do nothing to help the neediest ones. Thank God we only live once. I’d hate to come to this world again to deal with selfish humans again.

starzwillsucceed,lonely,1619958857.0,"People feel loneliest when they don't have someone to do fun things with, however, I get the loneliest when I don't have someone to do normal everyday things with.","To be fair, I do feel lonely when I want to go do something fun and I know no one wants to go with me, but when I feel loneliest is when I don't have someone to go do normal everyday things with such as: grocery shopping, clothes shopping, possibly church, taking a drive to the fast food joint to score some taco hell, play video games with, clean the house, watch TV, make the bed, cook, BBQ, or just fuckin chill on the back porch listening to music. 

There are so many other things that I would like a partner to be with me while doing, it seems so far fetched these days. Finding someone that would match with my personality type seems long gone. I'll just continue to do life by myself."

plantnumghost,lonely,1619932557.0,I Just Want to Feel Wanted,I feel like my friends just don't really like me that much. At school everything seems fine and we are all joking around and all having a good time and even some of my friends tell me that we are pretty close. But then I always see them posting on their story that they are hanging out and I just keep getting mixed messages. I just get the vibe that they just don't really like me that much so they just slowly start pushing me away. Part of it is whenever we are supposed to call on someone in class they always pick my friends but never me which also adds onto the feeling of not feeling wanted. But I can't just go and leave them because they are the only people in my school that I get along with since my school is so small and we have all been friends since elementary school so it would be hard to just cut them off. Also I'm in 1 of our groupchat's  but not in any other and I know that they have other one's bc I always see them typing in it or talking about it.

Looking back at them, I realized that most people just ignore me and only come to me when something interesting happens. I honestly just feel ignored. It could just be me wanting attention though. I just can't seem to fit in with people and it's driving me insane. I always think to myself ""hey, they are ignoring you because they aren't really your friends."" But at the same time I'm really committed to realizing that they are my real friends. Can anybody give me advice or something?"

Ottaro666,lonely,1619988475.0,My friend recommended me how to make friends in the current situation and I’m so happy about it,"*This is not an ad and I will not mention which app I’m talking about unless someone tells me that’s allowed.*

I kept feeling down because lately I’m pretty lonely and bored. I usually don’t mind having only one or two close friends, but since we’re still under lockdown it hit me more than usually. Plus all my classmates are younger than me and I can live with it, but I’d love to be friends with people my age. 

Anyways, I told my friend and she fortunately told me about an app where you can easily make friends. Since advertising isn’t allowed I won’t mention the name! It’s not hard to find apps like that though. I sent some people requests and even received one. Now I’m finally having someone who’s around my age that I can talk to, plus another friend. 

I can really recommend getting out there online at the moment. With corona and everything it’s not easy to make friends or date. But be careful when interacting with people online, and don’t give away private information like your real name or your address, etc.!"

Pennyroyal_Tea2,lonely,1619977870.0,Finally a day without feeling lonely and with some sweet sweet human contact,"Being an introverted guy with some social anxiety is already really hard in this society, and the pandemic made it ten times worse. Even tho I work in a supermarket (so I can interact with other people daily) and managed to hang out with a couple friends, at least on weekly basis whenever we could, loneliness during quarantine sometimes still feels really overwhelming.

The thing personally I miss the most is human contact. Cuddling, hugs or even just someone giving you a pat on the back or a handshake. In the long run the lack of human contact makes you feel so bad, to the point you start asking yourself if there's anything wrong with you.

Anyway, today in many eastern European countries it's Easter. Finally we had the chance to meet some relatives, eat and drink together and have a fun afternoon after a long long time. My uncles came to visit us for lunch and the afternoon, and since I have a little cousin she also came. She's only 4 years old and she's soo sweet and we vibe a lot together. Lonely and human contact starved me couldn't stop hugging her every ten minutes or so, probably hugging her way over 20 times this afternoon. We played together with some snapchat filters, took a few pics together, I showed her my guitar and played a couple songs, we both combed each others hair and just cuddled a little on sofa. I'm feeling happy and good right now. Dunno how long it will last, but I'm so glad I can say \*screw you loneliness\* for a day.

To all of you guys out there feeling down, opportunities like this are rare. But they exist. Sometimes life just gives you a sunny day when you thought clouds and rain would never go away. Keep the good work up and be glad whenever you have a nice day, cause they are priceless.

I know most of the posts here are sad and negative, but I hope reading this gave someone a little hope. Even if it's just one person who enjoyed reading this I'm more than glad! Cheers!"

Dakbirdy,lonely,1620379227.0,Losing my boyfriend (ex) & best friend at one time hurts badly.,"After losing my best friend/roommate, All I can think about is the good times that we had and what made me happy to be her friend. The noise in the apartment is quiet without my boyfriend ( ex now ) making noise just makes nervous and sad. All I could wonder why both had to turn on me when I refuse to allow her best friend) boyfriend to move in.

At the time, I wanted my ex out of the house so maybe we can get along better and have the space we need. As well too stop lying to my parents about people inside my apartment, that they had their name written on the lease. Main reason, it would be me and her again yet the worst scenario had to happen over nothing. Just dumb gossip between my boyfriend(ex) and best friend who started the despise me. I know it had to be my boyfriend who stir the pot for his sake and she believed him.

No matter how angry I try to stay it would always get replaced by sadness and I wondering how will I deal with so much heartbreak and loneliness at once. 

And now I'm cuddle up with a plushie my father gave me for Valentine's Day years ago. It helps to feel some kind of connection towards someone and not try to feel lonely. Yet my heart is hurting badly and my sorrow is almost killing me. And this happened about 2 weeks ago and I'm still crying and grieving."

I'm jealous of the stupid instagram posts I see of them all hanging out. I've gained weight as well, slowly going to skinny fat to just fat.

I wish I knew what I was doing wrong so I could fix it but I feel stuck. It sucks most girls go for the “bad boys” who treat them like shit, I just wish I could get a chance. I’ve been battling a porn addiction and suicidal thoughts because of how lonely and depressed I feel. I wish things were different, I wish there was a way out. I try my best in doing the right things: working out, meditating, reading, practicing self love, etc but I can’t escape this feeling of lack, this craving for human interaction.

KubrickandMorty,lonely,1619919431.0,I hate being alone in college,"Almost all of my friends are seeing people or are in relationships. I spent some time with some classmates to work on an assignment today, and they all started talking about the various people they were seeing. I had to just pray they wouldn't ask me, because I would have nothing to say. I've been alone for almost three years, haven't even held someone's hand in that time, and every day I just get one day further from knowing how it feels to be wanted. It just seems like I'm wasting my time in college. My friends, even my brother, are in relationships or hook up with people, and I can't even find the opportunity to talk to someone. Tinder has become a daily reminder that nobody wants to be with me.

&#x200B;

I reached a new low today. My friend, who I have feelings for (and who has rejected me in the past), told me that she received a message from a guy on an anonymous website run by our school. The website basically operates by having people send anonymous messages to people they're interested in, and then the person has to guess the identity of the mystery person. Like an idiot, I signed up and sent my friend a message, because it was the closest I could feel to having someone be interested in me. She responded, and now I have to pretend to be someone else so she doesn't find me weird and stop being friends with me. So now I have to have someone who I'm interested in message me in pursuit of a potential fling or whatever, all the while knowing that she would have no interest in me in real life. 

&#x200B;

I guess it's not a real problem, just a small hole that I've dug for myself, but I'm just feeling more alone than usual. Desperation is a hell of a drug, I suppose."

MissedSupper,lonely,1620604950.0,Don't Give Up. You Are Your Hope.,"To everyone in this community, it is deeply sorrowful that you feel isolated to the point that you don't even feel like you have yourself. That's what loneliness and numbness from depression can do to your heart. I'm sorry you don't feel loved, especially when there are billions of people on Earth but they fail to be at our aid when we need them more than we feel like we need Earth itself to breathe. 

We have to address our hurting by not stopping our options for a **future** with suicide. It may feel easier to stop living when the inside of your head is a mental hell and you may feel like you're a mentally ill person or even the loneliness may drive you to believe: ""I am unlovable"".

But even when the whole world doesn't seem to exist for us in that moment of deep despair or that long grieving for the childhood or moments of happiness that seem distant, we have to choose our own wellness first. That means letting go of the scary thoughts that no one is coming in to save you or be your friend. It hurts so much and it is soul-breaking but that's how you start to realize how important you are because then you do realize you are always there for you. 

This may not feel like the truth because we can also be our greatest of enemies. Our mental illness drives us crazy. However, they exist **to tell us something**. You are always there for you even if it feels counterintuitive. We can act negatively because **we want to express our pain**. We feel depressed because **we need to treat ourselves better**. We feel anxious because anxiety is a defense mechanism that tells us **""something is wrong""**. We can self-harm because we may be suffering from anhedonia (no pleasure due to severe depression) and so we need to release ourselves from the pain of emptiness. We feel suicidal because we want to stop our pain but we don't know how to manage our emotions or get away from the pain. 

**We need to learn** to manage our emotions in a healthy and effective manner. This means looking at our situations and to analyze ourselves logically as we lack the thoughtfulness behind objective thinking. Doing so well help establish a balanced way to thinking. A beautiful way of thinking that you can see life and appreciate every aspect of it. Starting with objective thinking will help ease the projecting self-doubting thoughts. It will start to develop your subjective (Feelings) so you may feel free from your internal hell. Finally, you shall have open mindedness at its truest form. 

Please DM me if you would like to talk. The above skill is important for humanity to learn so I am hoping to make a mental health website with my friends and I. Please use these skills, please share these skills and please hold onto yourself because you literally NEED you!!

Much love and hold on.

Bless you xoxo"

It's depressing and I make others depressed.
 I envy those guys who have a passion in a sport and can talk about it all day, or those people who can go to parties and talk to everyone and have fun, or those who can play videogames with their friends and laugh alot saying and doing the dumbest shit they could think of, or even the kids who go on bike trips with their friends to have a good time, like why I can't do any of that???

There's a phenomenon with humanity where some people are naturally outcast without great commotion. Some of us are just silently excluded, like Milton from Office Space waiting on a piece of cake. The reality is that neither nature nor humanity cares about your social well-being, especially if you're a male.

If you're confident, successful in your career, funny, outgoing, extroverted, but still single and alone, people assume it's by choice.

I've seen this every day of my breathing life. No one that ever met me would be able to guess I feel this way because I am extroverted, and yes often the funny man in the room.

The common advice on Reddit dating subs follows the fight-or-flight pattern: get ripped and put on some cologne, and if you're already doing that and asking out women and failing, then flee and just forget about it. Your luck WILL change when you least expect it. It's guaranteed. That's the attitude.

Nature is unfortunately not so kind, it kills people and animals alike indiscriminately. Why would social isolation or any other form of suffering be any different?

How do I remain happy through all of these thoughts? How am I not suicidal?

Because I am more fortunate than those who have died young. And even if women will never find me attractive, and even if guys don't want to hang out with me, cheerfulness and positivity are all that I have left. Jokes and self-deprecating humor make me feel whole again. Kindness and charity connect me with the world that has rejected me for who I am.

It's better to go out in class as a grateful, cheerful, focused individual rather than one wallowing in his/her own pain. Accept life's morbid realities, realize that it's not fair, embrace the outcome which may or may not be eternal loneliness, and savor every drop of life's beauty."
gUmFisT,lonely,1620546260.0,I'm really lonely.,"I'm 15 almost 16, I haven't had any relationships and I'm crying again, just right now as I type this.
And what makes this worse is that everyone I knew in my life (my parents, my siblings, cousins, classmates, or whoever I have known so far in real life) have friends and older ones having to be on a couple on top of them that care for each other, active relationships unlike me.

My mother has my father, my father has my mother, my little sister has dear friends, all my older stepsisters are on a healthy couple relationship, all my cousins have dear friends, my classmates walk with someone very often unlike me, who has no one.
Looking at everyone having fun with others and their friends and all that stuff, makes me kind of glad and happy for them that they probably wouldn't have to go though this and that they have somebody to live for but the thought about thinking if I'll ever be like the people I see or if I'll ever have someone that would care about me as much I would care for them just completely overshadows that.
No matter what I do, I will always keep thinking about that everytime I see relationships and such, it just so begins to pain me feeling that nobody cares.
I also seem to have social anxiety, struggling to open up to others, nearly my whole teen life confined in quarantine and covid failing my online classes. I'll be an adult as this whole pandemic would be over and it just starts to scare me that my highschool years were wasted. I have already struggled opening up in-person without covid lacking friends, people and classmates knowing me for being shy and no way I would even be able to make a friend with this broken online system.
Theres just so many things that make me feel even more lonely than the person I already am, a fully lonely person who has nobody."
Swimming-Direction70,lonely,1620142545.0,Tired of feeling this way,"
I’m 18 years old and for the longest time I’ve felt empty and lonely. Dating apps only reinforce that so I’ve deleted them but it hurts seeing how easy it is for some guys to pull girls. I’m not even sure what to think anymore, I don’t think I’m that bad looking or that bad of a person but it seems like I just have the worst luck. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong so I could fix it but I feel stuck. It sucks most girls go for the “bad boys” who treat them like shit, I just wish I could get a chance. I’ve been battling a porn addiction and suicidal thoughts because of how lonely and depressed I feel. I wish things were different, I wish there was a way out. I try my best in doing the right things: working out, meditating, reading, practicing self love, etc but I can’t escape this feeling of lack, this craving for human interaction. Maybe I’m just feeling sorry for myself and I should suck it up but I needed to get this off my chest. I hope whoever is reading this has a great day, and if you’re feeling as lonely as I am that the pain subsides and you find a meaningful purpose to stay alive and enjoy life. God bless."
estevao_mod,lonely,1619879278.0,I so fck miss my friends,"hi, guys. I am Estevão and i am 22 yo. Let me tell you guys my history. I spent most of my life in the church, but I left it when I went to college and changed many of my ideals and beliefs. After going through a period of great confusion with myself after leaving the church, I am already in a much better time and I can like myself the way I am. My friends walked away from me while I was in this transition phase of leaving the church, and to be honest, I also stayed away from them because I stopped going to the same places we used to go to, like church, evangelical parties, meetings with other young evangelical people, and so on. I am not angry with them, on the contrary, I still like them, but we are on different paths. Many of them are getting married and are going on with their lives, and I somehow miss having them with me and the moments we live in. Today I write this because it was my brother's birthday and one of my friends came here at home and we had some conversations. It is difficult for me to live with all this, I tend to understand, but in the end there is always that feeling that we could still be together and following similar paths. I feel bad for leaving them, but at the same time I feel good because I believe my place was not to stay in the church. I made some good friends in college, but they are kind of circumstantial friends, and when they finish college they will also leave. This year I will finish college and I believe that very soon I will move to another city and this cycle of my life will end in an end. Have you guys gone through something like that?"

Little_Constant7739,lonely,1619889547.0,I am alone feeling like screwed up !,"So its gonna be a long text get set for a ride .I was never the social type of person but i would always had people close to me to hang around and do stuff .From when i was in the age of 12 i would always had a best friend to do literally everything with him .As i was growing up,i kept losing all of my close friends due to their parents job cause they had to transfer to another town ,etc...around highschool after another close friend has  left and basically changed city(living in an island so basically leaving the island its pretty hard to keep in touch with other)i met another guy who was pretty alone and immediately we created a strong bond .As years passed we he kept being my best friend while for 2 years we stopped chatting cause i got into a group with other friends doing stuff that my best friend didn't like cause he was the type of the housecat person.With my new friends we were keeping strong emotions hanging out all the time and doing stuff .Basically here comes the circle again i made a new best friend and after a year he had to leave the cott and basically change country but we kinda kept on touch through gaming .Reaching the age of 18 ot was the time for me to go to a university. First day and i am literally frozen in motion literally cant talk to anyone .I mean i was expecting that to happen but i thought i would have the willpower to manage and talk to anyone . It turned out that my mentality was too weak and ended up viewing mt first class solo on the back seats of the classroom .I was so nervous that my college life could be a huge mess .Second day as i was sitting and watching the lecture some guy came to talk to me ans we started hanging out .several days in and 2 more guys came and we created a group to sit and chat .We hanged a lot doing stuff outside of the university.Basically after a month from the 4 of us the one guy started dissapearing,the second guy transfered to another university and the third guy just gave up the whole college stuff and left so i was once again alone .Entering the class i caught with my eye another guy sitting a row behind me alone .I found the courage to speak with him and we ended up after some chatting becoming best college friends .that guy introduced me to some of his friends and we created another group .Basically the story begins from here.With one of his friends we became pretty close spending all the day with eachother and doing stuff .For some reason we argued and both of our behaviours started to change .He said some stuff as a joke ,i got really angry and i started fading away.i noticed changes in my behavior like i was keeping a big distance from people .i couldnt laugh that easily anymore and started to loose my cool and became a boring person .Summer came and i met my group of friends from where i was living .We were doing stuff all summer and basically it was one of the best summers in my life.i noticed again due to my behavior like i was kinda left out of the good stuff but i didn't have a problem with that cause i just wanted to hang out with someone .the end of the summer comes and its time for my university to starts again.The point is that my friend has announced me that he will leave college life and just come for a week or two for the exams.Then i fell like the depression was started to hitting on me.I spend a lot of time locked in my house watching movies playing video games and eating.I left myself out of control turned onto an obese person and the problems kept railing up.Going to 1 year ago i decided to send a message to my friend from highschool .he answered and we started talking for days about how messed up both of our lives were and how ruined they were by the circumstances of the enviroment we were in and how we slowly destroyed them .
The summer came and we started hanging around with mt friend more .he was pretty closed to himself so i tried to drag him with the group of friends i had but he wasnt in the mood and i respected that.With that group of people i was started to being left out from stuff more and more .i felt like hell watching them randomly all together while i was alone so we started fading .Now o just have that one friend that we rarely do stuff due to him prefering being at home and me feeling so lonelt .I HAD MORE TO WRITE BUT THE THINGS I WROTE ARE ENOUGH TO SEE MY STORY DONT KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE ME BUT I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO THEM AND HEAR THEIR STORIES .ALSO SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH THEY ARE MY SECOND LANGUAGE !"
Andres_03,lonely,1620520625.0,Feeling desperate for human interaction and i need someone to talk,"Hi there, I'm 24 M, i really don't even know what to do at this point, yesterday i had one of those moments when i just started talking to myself out of desperation, the feeling of having none to talk to just was too much, the worst part is that i couldn't even bring myself to cry, i felt very disappointed with my life, i have no real friends and my economic situation is not the best, i'm an artist trying to earn money online since that is my dream and i'm finally trying to achieve it, but well, i guess that i just want some encouragement from someone that i know, that worries about me and treats me like a friend, i just recently (two weeks ago) i build up the courage and got in contact with and old friend, almost 4 years since we last talk, she's on a similar situation or at least that is what she told me trough messages, we agreed on keep talking with each other every once in a while, i really though that it would be great even if it was one day once a week since she at least knew something about me, and even if she really didn't care that much about me it was giving me hope of finally having a friend to talk to, now it's been 3 days since the last message where after we talked for days i said ""And what about you?"" and no response, i didn't say much, we were just caching up but i notice that she wasn't interested in talking (at least not like me) i would even say that se was bored, i know that she does not have an obligation to respond, she has her own life and problems to deal with, and to be honest i don't think she did it on purpose or with bad intentions, is just that i'm tired of being ignored and i don't think that i can even get angry about it, there's none to blame here other that myself, maybe i shouldn't have my hopes up but then again i wasn't expecting much, i just wanted someone to talk to every once in a while and maybe a friend, that is what happen yesterday when i broke and started to talk to myself again, i felt pathetic, i don't know how to feel emotions anymore just desperation and anxiety, I've been told that I'm a boring and serious person before, and being honest i have to agree a little bit but is involuntary, i want to open myself to others but i haven't found anyone that cares about what i think or i want to do, i'm just really tired at this point"

pleshwq,lonely,1619904217.0,feeling like an outcast,"i live with my amazing partner. she’s a social butterfly who gets along with everyone and has many friends. 

i have two friends, one who lives 2 hours away from me and one who lives across the world. 

i feel very lonely. whenever i hang out with my partners friends (technically ours but it doesnt feel like it) i feel like an outcast who doesn’t belong. i feel like i don’t understand anyone and like no one gets me. this makes me cry and feel suicidal every time we hang out with others, but i obviously hide it and pretend im all good and i act social and nice to everyone. 

the only time and occasion i feel liked and like i ”vibe” with someone is when i had hook ups and dated people. i feel like i shined and i was very liked. that also kind of makes me feel depressed because maybe the reason i was getting praise and attention was because they just wanted sex from me."

boatsir,lonely,1620126075.0,"I’m lonely but I really feel like I shouldn’t be. I’m lonely even around my friends, all because of my codependency to one person.","M[18] I need some advice here, I’ve been spiralling quite a bit recently. So, I’m a very naturally happy person. I’m extroverted and I have loads of friends. I’ve always been ok not being the person any of them are the closest to, because I had my best friend. We used to date until she got overwhelmed by the concept of dating, and broke up with me. I love her SO much. I’d practically do anything for her, but I also consider her the worst thing that’s happened to me. Since meeting her 2 years ago, I’ve become completely codependent on her. She loves me, she knows me more than anyone. I have a hard time feeling myself and comfortable with others (as much as I love having friends) and me and this girl could spend weeks on end together. We did everything together, she would get more angry at others than I did when people were mean to me. She loved me just as much as I loved her, or more. A bit ago I stopped talking to ALL my other friends, I only needed her. I’ve kind of regained all my old friends not too long ago though.
But recently she told me she just, doesn’t feel connected anymore. She hasn’t been feeling disconnected from everything recently. It’s just me. It doesn’t seem to be bothering her or anything either, she seems pretty happy when we have our weird conversations like we’re two strangers that don’t have a connection. She always takes a while to answer. I can’t be honest to her about being sad, I know she’ll just get awkward and leave and I can’t deal with that.
I’ve recently got incredibly clingy to my other friends. I don’t want to be alone thinking about the possibilities of losing her for one second. But without her there, I can’t connect to anyone, but I still feel clingy with them. I know I both like them more than they like me but feel less connected to them than they do to me simultaneously. It’s really getting to me. All of them are there for me, but the thought that they’re helping me even though they don’t feel very close me, really hurts. 
I probably sound like some guy who can’t get over his ex, but I’m autistic, I’ve never gotten this type of connection in my life. She’s also autistic and understood my special interests and would comfort me when I got sensory overload.
Does anyone have any advice for how to get over this loneliness and codependency?"

Dangerous-Stick-831,lonely,1620099375.0,I feel like I never had the opportunity to fit into society,"Ever since I was little, I always remember being alone. While in preschool other children would be playing amongst themselves, I would be playing with woodchips imaging I was the protagonist from *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*. There would be a few times I'd play with other kids, but my interactions were limited. I remember one time in kindergarten there was this kid new to my school, so I befriended him. I held a birthday party that year, but he didn't show up. At school the following day presumably, he told me that he didn't come not because he was busy or anything, but because he didn't want to.

Throughout elementary, I would try to fit in with other students, but I was always following people versus leading them. There was this one boy in my class that was very charismatic and would control what the majority of people did during recess. Every year, I remember hoping I would get invited to his birthday party. Sometimes I would, sometimes I wouldn't. I would always feel sad and left out when I wasn't invited. Throughout elementary, I did partake in sports and scouts, but this didn't help me make friends at all.

Fourth grade or so was when I started to feel like I didn't fit into society, and society didn't want me in it either. Multiple times, children would tell me their parents said not to hang out with me. I don't feel this was warranted. I wasn't that bad of a child. I'd disrespect adults here and there, and I used curse words. None of this was too bad compared to the average child my age. I always tried to be civil and nice to people and corrected many of my issues before Christmas break that year. Nothing changed and this pattern of rejection and social outcast has persisted until today. I would only very rarely get invited to hang out with children my age outside of school, either through playdates or birthday parties. I would attend one out-of-school social event every three or so months.

In fifth grade, I reached my height of social popularity, but it didn't last long. I became somewhat of a class clown, but the teacher liked me, so I wasn't that horrible. More popular students in my grade thought I was funny, so I became friends with them. Still, this was around the time when everyone started getting cell phones. I never got a cell phone and didn't understand the appeal. I also, despite my in-school popularity, never was invited to anything outside of school. I was sort of that kid people would talk to in classes to pass time, but outside of this limited circumstance, there was no reason to talk to me. With this social isolation growing and me dropping out of extracurricular activities, I began turning towards the Internet for social interaction. Of course, I had been using the Internet for years, playing online games, but I had never tried making connections with people before. The Internet stopped being a way for me to simply play games I loved and instead became a drug of the social life I desired. 

Through Minecraft, I developed many friendships. Of course, none of these were long-lasting, and as soon as I stopped playing Minecraft, I lost all of these friends. Later I started playing Terraria again and made more new friends. This led to me getting Discord, which even further increased my amount of online friends. None of these friends stuck around; many seemed to disappear as fast as they appeared. My best friend one month would be my enemy the next, or they would forget about me or turn on me for seemingly no reason. 

Around this time, I started developing misanthropic feelings due to my loneliness. No matter what I did, I could never seem to get friends. I grew jealous of others for their successes and wondered what they were doing that I wasn't. I grew getting more sad and frustrated with myself. I found that just my username, like my name in real life, would lead people to automatically hate me. People would hear rumors about me and not even give me a chance. Numerous Discord servers I was banned from because of things people had heard about me, many of which were not true and spread by stalkers or people who betrayed me. 

I looked for a solution for this problem, and I thought I found it. I began making numerous alternate accounts under which I would act differently. I started first with accounts where I would say I was a foreigner. I didn't gain any online social advantages from this, but at least my name wasn't holding me down anymore. This series of alternate accounts led to me making accounts where I, a male, would claim to be female. I mainly just did it because I was curious what it would be like to be female, or at least act like I was female, much for the same reasons I acted like a foreigner before. I grew amazed with my social success. I was invited to multiple Discord servers and would be often invited to play games with people. This didn't last long for me, as it made me very sad. I knew the reason these people were friends with me was not because of my personality or anything, but because I was acting like a female. I wasn't myself. This instilled in me an envy of females, as I viewed them as already having an advantage socially due to being female (there are many less females in online spaces I hang out). The accumulation in this was gender dysphoria for about a year (sorry if that isn't the right term, but other transgender people I had associated with short-term had shared my feelings). 

I've been mostly talking about the online part of my life for the past couple of years, but that's because it was the only life I had. I only became more socially isolated. Throughout all of middle school, I think I was only invited to one or two parties. I didn't have any stable friends, and would even be deliberately outcast by people, probably by their parents' wishes. 

High school was nice as I was around a lot of new people. Throughout years of social isolation, I didn't even know how to make friends. People seemed to already have their friend groups set. The only attention I would get from others would be mockery. Males would mock me in front of females and their friends, giving me sarcastic compliments. Females would hold cameras to my face to post on their social media while laughing. I'm not an attractive person, and throughout all my life have been called ugly by classmates and family alike, so I think it is safe to assume people in high school viewed me more as a circus attraction of socially awkward ugliness than a human being. 

I would begin trying to find advice on how to not be a social outcast. I read that being confident is the most important thing, but I could never understand what the meaning of this was. Being nice and kind was another piece of advice, and something I understand. I would help struggling students with their work and quickly became known to be helpful. Teachers would even request that I step up to the board while they would run out of the room. Despite my attempts at being nice and friendly, people ignored me when I wasn't helping them with their schoolwork. On top of this, people would pressure me to tell them the answers on tests for school. Cheating makes me feel sick, so this led to me not being so eager to help people anymore.

When COVID-19 came around, I was refined to my house. I would go months without interacting with anyone outside of my dysfunctional family. I didn't have any online friends, and I didn't have any real-life friends. Everything seemed so lonely. 

This trend continues through today. I don't know how I will manage to get a job or have a family. I cannot even imagine myself outside of my parents' house. I get good grades, but I cannot even hold a conversation anymore. Stuttering habits have developed throughout COVID-19 due to my isolation. I've picked up some hobbies throughout COVID-19, but due to restrictions, I haven't been able to attend any events for these hobbies. 

I doubt anything will change in the future after COVID-19. I try to be hopeful for the future and continue waiting for the day that everything will make sense to me. I would try to do something to change my situation, but I don't know what I can do."

sunflowersfascinate,lonely,1620421196.0,Outgrowing friends or am I pushing everyone away?,"It kind of is a hard pill to swallow, I don't know how I got this lonely.

I have a live in boyfriend whom I am in constant contact with. He is my best friend, truly believe my soulmate. He has quite a few friends who he can occupy his time with when we work opposite schedules. Aside from him and my one friend who I don't see often, I feel like my connections and friendships are superficial, no real depth. I feel like I overshare in most of my friendships and it is hard to develop bonds with people when they don't want to be vulnerable. 

My male friendships either end because they can't respect my boundaries or their girlfriends don't like them speaking to girls. One of my best friends since 12 (I am 30 now) stopped talking to me because his girlfriend wasn't okay with him having me as his friend even though I've been with my boyfriend over 7 years...

I have a hard time maintaining friendships with girls, I don't know how to bond with them honestly. Most girls I meet don't have much to talk about. I LOVE makeup but don't know how to have deep conversations with them about it. 

Along this journey I am realizing the type of friends I want to attract. Those who are into the things I am! From music, astrology, gaming. I also like to enjoy the beach, go to the movies and watch stand up.  I think because I lean introverted I get drained easily, so when I try explaining to my friends why I don't want to go out, I feel like an awful friend. Sometimes I would hang out of friends and not enjoy myself, but now I avoid situations that I won't enjoy.

Recently one of my friends stopped talking to me because I didn't show up to her boyfriend's event. I told her in advanced that I wanted to study instead of go out. I don't want to waste my energy on people being constantly passive aggressive anymore.

The old me was okay with friends who would complain or nag, I think I was breeding toxic habits and somewhat attracting the same energy.

I know there are like minded souls out there, just not sure where to begin meeting them! Feel free to drop me a DM :)

I have very little amounts of friends except for my girlfriend and roommate. I don't want them to worry but my depression has been getting awful lately and I hate feeling lonely but constantly find myself in a lone position. If anyone wants to consistently just talk and become friends that would be amazing. I just feel like no one is even out there anymore. I love everyone and I wanna thank anyone who read this all the way through. Thank you :)"

Fireshrimp420,lonely,1620218640.0,18 f with no friends,My whole life I’ve kept to myself and have had 2 childhood best friends that have stuck with me through everything. That all changed when I got into smoking weed. It’s all I would want to do and eventually they saw this and left me. It is all my fault. One of the 2 best friends actually started posting rumors about me on Snapchat to countless of people. The whole school thinks I harassed her at her workplace to the point where she had the permission to call the police. I had no platform to defend myself. Right now I feel so alone. I have nobody. I hate myself for what I’ve done. I’ve lost the two people that meant the most to me to an addiction. I just want to know how someone like me can even make friends. I’m not in school anymore as I opted to do all online classes. Is there any hope for me? Will I ever be comfortable feeling alone?

I have a good family and people who care about me but I don’t feel happy. I am lonely most of the time and spend majority of my time in my room. I have friends but I whenever I hangout with them, I usually just sit in a corner on my phone cause I don’t know what to tak about. I make some comments in between and make jokes but that’s it. I go back to my phone feeling accomplished like I did something good. I just feel lonely most of time and feel like I am missing on so many things I can and could have done. 

Weird thing but the only time I feel happy is while watching twitch. Idk why but I don’t feel lonely during that time, it feels like as if I am welcomed into the community and have something in common with the people watching with me.

1mJust1mbtw,lonely,1620163309.0,I seriously started having suicidal thoughts last summer,"I seriously started having suicidal thoughts last summer: i spent an entire week with the only friend i got, at the sea. We had fun and all but there’s a problem: he’s incredibly good looking. Not just a cute guy... literally a model. So, even when we had fun, girls approached him and left me apart, just to get his number. It really made me feel like trash. Plenty if girls that were waiting us to stop talking in order to approach him. I’ve never stopped comparing my life to his life. He’s always been popular, and plenty of girls. I didn’t care if he was full of girls, because i was looking for a serious relationship. But, some months ago, he got to know a girl ( she’s a model ) and their relationship is still going on. I’m surely happy for him... but life in not made to be happy for others.

Our friendship ended 1 month ago... when he sent me a nude pic of him half naked with this girl under her bed’s blankets. He knew that my situation with girls wasn’t ( and still isn’t ) great at all.

He was my only friend

I can’t stop thinking about him and his perfect life, his perfect face, his girlfriend... he has it all... while i’m balding ( at damn 18 years old ) and ugly. 

Sorry for this vent. I just got nobody with me since some months. I’m seriously looking for ways to get to know new people in real life ( like attending to courses or classes ) but my face will always be the same. Suggestions?"

Wait-Negative,lonely,1619902363.0,"Being in love with best friend, having to keep it a secret from literally everyone.","Full disclosure this is just gonna be me venting about the situation.

First I should note that when I say best friend I genuinely mean best friend. We’re open about our problems with one another, we have matching interests, we genuinely click as a duo. But she merely sees me as a close friend. Now, some history. She has already dated one of my most longtime friends for like 2 years, and has gotten with a new bf(whom I don’t know) just a few months back. This means not only can I not tell her about my feelings, I can’t tell anyone. Lest I be labelled a sneaky little shit, snaking his way into the picture after things ended between her and my friend. So I’ve kept in in entirely. I try to be the greatest best friend I can possibly be. But inevitably a new bf meant she has less time for my silly antics. Recently my texts have taken much longer to be seen, what used to be mere minutes have turned into whole days. And I’m lucky to get a real conversation from her like before. How is it possible to feel so utterly hurt and heartbroken, yet at the exact same time be so fucking happy for her to be happy? In the day or days I’ll wait for a response from my favourite person, I struggle with these contradictory feelings constantly. My heart always tells me “send her another text, maybe it’ll get her attention this time” but my brain constantly reminds me “you aren’t who she loves. You are her friend and nothing more, now back off and know your place” 

So yeah that’s the predicament. Just needed to get in out in some way"

I don't like it to go out. I never tried clubbing but i know that i hate it. Loud music that i not like. Way too much people. Alcohol, i don't like the taste and i know if i would be drunk i would do more stupid things then normally.

And even if i would meet a nice woman, about what should i talk with her? I'm a gamer, i like movies and books. How should i start the conversation? How should i keep the conversation going on? I'm introvert and not talkactive, the classic silent guy.

I've almost come to accept that it will never change. I don't try to push people away, yet I still end up doing so. The effects of loneliness and isolation only recently started taking a toll on me, more so to the point that I've purchased a weighted blanket and body pillow so as to help with sleeping and combating the cold empty grip of loneliness. Giving up on finding companionship is about the only thing I think about these days. I truly do try to find that sense of companionship, but always find that in the end, others don't seem to share that want or need.

If you don't speak any Chinese they would still be more than happy to speak to you in English and teach you a few words of Chinese if you're interested.

I haven't messaged first in a few  months and all my dms are from ages ago. Nobody gives a shit. My best  friends all abandoned me when we got older. I have to put on a front in  school to not seem lonely so nobody thinks to look twice or ask to  hangout or nothing. I tried swaying the pain by making friends in online  games, however none of them have hit me up in weeks, it's clear they  only played with me because I was good at the game and didn't actually  care about me or my personality or anything. I give up. Basically my  entire teenagehood was wasted. No memories of going to the movies, no  first kisses, nothing. I really just want one friend man. I even try  going out of my way to talk to people but we talk for a bit and then  never talk again... So no true friends. Literally... I don't think I've  been invited to a gathering or hanging out since I was 11 or 12. My  games aren't fun any more. School work has become pointless. I don't  enjoy watching movies or TVs, or playing with my siblings. I get  obsessive thoughts in my head about bad things that I know I would never  do in any lifetime. I've become an asshole through this depression,  lashing out for stupid shit. I don't know the real me anymore. I just  want one real friend... I've even recently started opening up on social  media and shit and so many people view the ocasionnal despressing shit I  post yet a total of ZERO have responded.

frik4nd3lbr00dj3,lonely,1619983482.0,My Reddit bot can send you some random questions to talk about with your friends 🤖,"**TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It’s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won’t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON’T be forwarded!

&#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‘!’ as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don’t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won’t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it’s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON’T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they’ll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess… It displays all the commands and well… tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

**Have fun :)**"

I struggle everyday to keep on going through this shitty life, but i keep on going, guess that its worth to mention that its because of animes like ""zetman"" (especially the quote ""keep your head up high, because you wont find hope lying on the ground"" or something like that).
The last time i talked with someone about this and told them how i feel...well they told me that i should stop living in self-pity...
When i talk to people close to me, i rarely get an answer that is ""understanding""...most of the replies i get are more ""condescending"" or trying to tell me to ""stop being/feeling like i do""...
I guess i just wish i had someone in my life who is would be truly interested in me and care about me...a little bit of warmth in this cold world...


Edit: I am listening to the ""Metal Gear Solid Vocal Tracks"", drinking some beer, while my cinnamon candle is flickering next to me... if anyone else feels lost, cold and lonely, i will gladly be a little warmth in this freezing cold for you..."
killsno,lonely,1620166371.0,what’s wrong with me bruhhhh,i’m a 19f okay and this isn’t about being lonely. well maybe kinda. i can’t keep a relationship or a friend out of my own actions! i’ll talk to a guy for maybe a couple months and things will go great and i’ll literally just cringe at any cute thing they do and push them away. but it’s not pushing away. i’m nice to them i’m just not a clingy person you could say? and they want more attention. which is understandable. and it breaks them every time. i always hurt ppl! i can’t keep friends bc i just don’t like leaving the house. as often and they want to. it ruins relationships too. just bc i don’t like hanging out a lot or texting. i’m actually so content being alone. i love my company. i’m never mean to them or anything. am i crazy. is it mean to be annoyed when someone has no other personality than trying to appease you? bc that’s what i feel every guy i’ve tried to be with has done. this post is everywhere. i just don’t know why i’m like this lmao. but if u wanna be friends im down i like internet friends better.

All my life I was an outcast, a loner, a loser, a nobody. But recently it's starting to really hit me that I'm so incredibly lonely and pathetic. I know that I sound like I'm complaining or being dramatic but it's how I truly feel. I can't help but to think that everything would be so much easier if I was never born.

,lonely,1619987003.0,I have no sexual or relationship experience after graduating college. I don't understand what I did wrong to not even be good enough for love and human affection. (22M),"I guess I can give a brief summary of my life so people know where Im coming from. Basically I have been lonely my whole life. I never really fit in anywhere and I’ve always felt like even the people I know I am not that close to.

I've done pretty well in school my whole life. I was valedictorian of my high school and I graduated a top 10 with a double major. I have the ultimate goal of pursuing an MD PhD to have a career in medical research and academic medicine. That being said I obviously know these things don't matter in finding love.

I struggled a lot in middle school and the first half of high school to find friends. Mostly everyone thought I was a nerd and a loser. I had the reputation of taking academics too seriously, even though I didn’t want to. I felt alienated from the “smart kids"" because I hated being viewed as a nerd and I also felt alienated from everyone else. This insecurity has never left me. I sincerely hate my intelligence and how hard I tried in school. It ended up amounting to nothing.

I was in a variety of clubs in high school and college. In hs I was in band (which I hated and quit 2 years into it) and speech and debate, where I made most of my friends in the latter half of high school. Even so, most of them thought of me as a loser and made fun of me for being a virgin. In all fairness I complained about being lonely at times. I felt alienated from them as well because of this.

In college I was in like 7 different clubs centered around service and medicine. I also joined a fraternity. I still had very few close friends in college. I had 0 female friends. I felt alienated from my fraternity a lot because I wasn’t hooking up with any women. I felt like I also wasn’t super crazy with drinking or partying.

Pretty much every social group I was in I never really felt a part of. I feel like I just dont belong anywhere. I am so lonely romantically I constantly fantasize about having a girlfriend that cares about me. I never asked to be valedictorian or go to a good college, the only thing I ever wanted in life was to feel loved and accepted. I don't even care that much about my career anymore. I'm just tired of being alone. I don't know what I did to deserve this."

QueenClaudia1998,lonely,1620494420.0,Nobody cares,"Every day I'm alone. Every day I feel less and less connected to other humans. Most people have at least one person who they put above anything or anyone else, but no one gives a shit about me. Why would they anyways? I'm an antisocial, neurotic mess. My mood changes like the weather. I haven't contributed anything ""special"" to society. I'm a waste of space and I hate myself so much. Sometimes I want to die but I'm afraid of dying. So everyday I isolate bc im so fragile and I don't want to give people the chance to hurt me anymore. Isn't it enough that I'm the most hated loser on earth already??"
NicklausArdahsasta,lonely,1620021777.0,Trying to survive seems incredibly tough these days,"Have you ever felt like you'd want to do something but just can't and you don't even know why? You're unaware whether it's laziness or just pure depression. You wanna go outside, but you're scared. You wanna make a real emotional connection to someone, but you fail, doesn't matter how many times you try. You're just stuck in your room with your phone and alone with your thoughts and you think that if you open your mouth, nobody would bat an eye. You think your words are worthless. You think that no one will listen to you. You feel like you're nothing in real life so you just mask yourself in social media platform cause you know that no one knows who you are and prolly would get responds that you wouldn't get in real life. You feel like you got no one to trust cause you don't get the kind of responds that you'd want. You want to be someone's special/favorite but realize that you're no one in real life. You're aware that your life is degrading after you realize that the last person that you feel loved was your abuser. You wanna get out of your country but unable to cause you're unemployed and plain useless. All you do all day is watching films cause it's the only thing that keeps you alive, but you don't feel safe cause you got your inner that can't stop criticizing yourself for not being productive. Every action, every word, every decision, you trash yourself for that. You think about end it all, but you think that it would be selfish. You just suffocate yourself. You can't stand yourself. You want to morph to someone else, but you know that it's not logically and scientifically possible. You're going insane, and you're aware of that."

God nothing has ever made me feel like shit faster. I kept my cool and gave her a hug and wished her a happy Mother’s Day. But I could tell she was once again disappointed by me. I could see that it hurt her. 

I love my mother. But ever since my dad died I’ve been a different person and I don’t try to but I end up being horrible to my mother all the time. I hate it and I hate myself."

Doeofdajane0,lonely,1620029423.0,"it's my 20th birthday and I have no friends, and my family doesn't believe in birthdays because of their religious belief system so no celebration","it's my 20th birthday today and I have no friends, and my family doesn't believe in birthdays because of their religious belief system so no celebration, and I have been raised like a loner, brainwashed since young, a lot of bs I can't share, I feel so worthless, People around me (family shows that they care, you can tell the difference). this morning I felt so many feelings, like, now I'm not a teen, my first digit changed, regarding my virginity. when I came to my room after freshening up, looked out the window and thought that there's nothing more to live for, I have failed attempts and I don't wana do it, I know I won't do it so no worries, I feel like no one gives even a little bit of f about me, on a deeper level. I was raised in a way to think that girls are bad and nothing and a boy/male should never meet a girl, or have any kind of connections, even tho my parents dated and frikin got married, this lead to me having love for females in my brain but to feel accepted I showed what they wanted me to show and feel, my parents are so sexist but in a different way, both of them thinks that females are low, Idk im so sorry I am all over the place, idk what to say, to talk about. they never let me have any relationship, not consciously but by brainwashing me, plus the food they were providing was not healthy, just rice legumes and shitty cheap vegies (i hate cooked vegies), not much meat and proteins and good vitamin-mineral containing foods, but mostly we ate rice vig, tortillas with curd and shit like that(sorry not trying to offend, when u eat that shit for so long you'll too hate it), my cognition wasn't good in my childhood and most of my early teenage life, so I didn't understand much, plus we all used to go to sleep super late at night, and then they forced me to wake up at 3-4 am for prayer, which lead me to not doing okay at school, not mentioning all the mental illness (ocd adhd mild touretts  Hallucination )I developed from all this. (which is so bad that I haven't gotten accepted at any job I have applied, plus I feel so embarrassed to exist in a public place for my social anxiety), my dad was rich but didn't provided us with much and gave most of his money to his mom's dad. the house we live in right now is my mom's dad given house(maternal grandfather), and my mom didn't get a divorce even her therapist told her to, but because of the society and religious belief system she didn't get it, a few years ago my sister got a divorce and came to live with us in this small house, and she is evil, she cheated on her husband, got a divorce, came here, living with us with her kid, uses my mom work, eats here and cusses and swears at my mom, me, she also used to torture her kid when she(her child) was 2-4 years old by darkening her room, closing doors and windows and blasting horror sound and showing horror gore images to her child to make her sleep by yellig at her. so she came and because of her we had to get a big house on hi-rent for a temporary purpose and that caused me to leave school because it was too far from that house and other reasons, then they patched up then divorced again, now she has thrown her child at my mom n dad for care and shes working a job, and enjoying her self. there was a time in 2018 when I was finally getting better but that's when she came for the second time permanently and her negativity made everything a mess again.  I feel so like a trash bag being thrown here and there just like I'm nothing. I tried therapy, but it doesn't help. I always and still do, felt good about all the womens, but there's some out there, one like my sis, that are just pure evil, and dads just married my mom to use her as an object. I almost never felt loved by a girl at any age, and when I talked to my mum about it, she says ""you got me, you can love your mom"" in an evil tone, yea I can and I do love you mom, but there's a different kind of connection with a women whos not your own blood, but she doesn't understand this. I just hate them all now, so much, Idk why I wrote such a long-ass post, I am not feeling anything, sorry if you don't agree with me, and please correct me if I'm wrong. living life is just so hard for me now, that I just cant explain it, I don't want to exist, but I have failed so many times while attempting it and I don't wana feel that pain again anymore.. I feel so less of a human. im not asking for anything just felt like writing this here so Ill feel a bit light but it isn't helping. and I am sorry if i came of a bit rude, I cant talk when im high on emotions so sorry if i offended anyone of you.

Edit: its 7 hours later. my mom said ""hey it's your 20th birthday, here's 50 bucks"", and gave me 50 bucks. thanks, mom. at least she cared. but all I wanted is a normal childhood and good positive communication. anyway...  I'll focus more on positive stuffs and be great full that I at least got to experience my mom saying that and giving me a 50, even tho I didn't asked for it or wanted it. there are people who doesn't have a mom or a family.  so thank you universe for that. :) after all its not so bad."

The older I get less opportunities I have to experience the normal things in life it feels. Everything feels pointless cause I feel so alone.

BudgetKaleidoscope1,lonely,1620059160.0,I have never hung out with friends,"For a good portion of my highschool career I spent all my breaks in the library watching YouTube. I now sit with this group of girls who act like I'm not there.  They always talk about parties, things sent on their WhatsApp group and tons of inside jokes. I do try join in the conversation but they normally talk over me or ignore what I said. At this point I've given up and and wish I stayed in the library even though these kids made fun of me for it. 

Here's the thing, I have never done any sort of ""typical teenager"" thing. Haven't gone on dates, hung out with friends or even held hands with someone I like. I feel as though I'm wasting these valuable years (16F). What makes it worse is that every time I open social media I see my peers do these things. Having fun. I literally just go to school and then go straight home. 

I have 3 online friends which makes it better I suppose.

But I hold on to the hope that university will be better. Maybe even hang out with friends.

awkwardbean04,lonely,1620124685.0,The worst luck with girls,"Ok so basically I have tried to purse 5 relationships with girls that ik are into me at least just lil and they all crash and burn in a short amount of time. Im 17 m btw. With all this being said I kinda feel worthless and not successful as a man. I have really good qualities too ( at least I think). I am honest,funny,not bad looking,confident,and fun. I also have some bad qualities too, such as I can be a dick on accident a-lot, Im short (5’6), and I can be awkward sometimes. Every situation where Im starting to talk to a girl I really think I have a chance. Then things take a U turn. I will give u a couple examples. I was dating this girl for literally a week and we were really good friends before, so we connected. Then all of the sudden she dumps me for another guy. Another example is the most recent one (reason i’m writing this post). This story is really fucked btw. So I was scrolling on snap one day and added a ton of people. I then added a light-skin girl that wanted to know me. We met up and we instantly connected. By the 4th time we hung out she kissed me and we were flirting heavily. She was sitting on my lap and shit and touching me a-lot so I thought I was about to have someone. Then we hang out for the 5th time and she was acting extremely moody. When I first get there she gets her brother or someone to tell me if I hurt her he will beat tf out of me. I was confused cuz we weren’t dating. After that she calls a friend and her friend starts talking about me. She asks if Im her bf and she immediately says nooo as if Im disgusting. She then said I was a bad kisser ( even though it was a peck). I felt kinda hurt by that so I asked her what I did wrong. She didn’t answer me so I asked a couple more times. She then starts to call another friend so I put my headphones in. She got offended by this and asked why I did it. I ignored her and shortly after I said y’all hear sum as a joke. She immediately gets mad and says shes going home. I tell her sorry but she keeps walking. I then apologize on snap when I get home but she leaves me on open. 30 min later her brother starts texting me on her account saying I fucked up and he was gonna beat tf out of me. I was so blown away by this because all I did was a stupid joke. Then after that she sent me a snap saying bae’s streaks. I think she had a bf the whole time or she wants me to back off. All I know is that hurt me for a bit until the brother came in and I was like this girl is crazy. Tell me what u guys think. Was I in the wrong or was she. Also if u pm me I will drop a pic so u can tell me if Im ugly or not. Some people think I am and others don’t. I think I dont look too bad but idk anymore. Im questioning alot of things rn."

In light of the ongoing global pandemic situation, my country is under controlled movement with restrictions so technically we  have to stay home. Anyhow, my birthday has been very depressing since I got kicked out from my relative's house in my late teens. I never have a chance to celebrate and feel special.  Social media is not an ideal platform for me to vent. I always feel that these people are more fortunate than me. I don't have many friends, had an abusive ex (I left him, Thank God).

I would love to share cake slices. I would love to receive presents. I would love to share my happiness with anyone on my birthday. I just want to feel special. I never have a chance. I am lonely. Internet keeps me entertained. I don't feel... acknowledged. 

To my surprise, not many people I know remember my birthday last night and I was saddened by the fact that people treat me like a stranger. My close friend forgotten to send a birthday wish but ended up, texted me when saw me online, ""Happy Birthday, zinoria. Sorry for the Covid thing has happened so I hope you stay alive out there."" That's reassuring enough.

My life is a joke. My birthday is supposed to be a day which I should feel happy about it. Sometimes I feel that I shouldn't be alive."

We chatted daily. Messages about everything and nothing, just company at a distance. And sometimes up close. 

It's only when that's not there that the silence really surrounds you. 

I miss their presence. Random, warm, comfortable.  It feels like much longer than it has been, and it feels like it will stretch on forever.

I just needed to say it, because the one person I used to tell these things isn't there to hear anymore.

It's just a void in the shape of them."

Pretty normal. I guess. For the last few years, I’ve hated coming home at the end of the night because I’m always alone.

I’m not looking for sex, I’m not looking for friends, and I’m not looking to fill my life with anymore hobbies, etc. all I’m looking for is intimacy. That warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you’re emotionally, spiritually, and physically connected to another human. Is that too much to ask for? I don’t understand how and why people go out and get drunk just to get off. How cheap is that? How insulting is that to the beauty of love and intimacy? Why don’t people go out and seek intimacy rather than cheap sex? 

Idk during the day everything is fine because I’m busy enough. I go out with friends and meet people. But still I’m here, alone again and again and again. I just don’t know if I can be alone again. Idk if I can sleep alone again."

imonabloodbuzz,lonely,1620266501.0,She’s probably forgotten about me. Meanwhile I’d do anything to receive just one “good morning” text from her,"I’m emotionally weak. I know.

I recently met a girl online after giving online dating one last try. We hit if off immediately. We had so much to talk about over text. It was the first time a woman took genuine interest in me in my 25 years on Earth or so I thought.

We went on our first date. It felt like reconnecting with an old best friend. We walked 9 miles together, we had so much to say. She was funny, kind, thoughtful and gorgeous. She had the most unbelievable eyes. Yet she was going out with me, a socially awkward and average looking virgin. We didn’t need to discuss whether we wanted a second date, it was assumed. Same thing with the third date. And the fourth. No sex, but I had my first kiss ever with her.

We’d send hundreds of texts a day. About dinner, work, or whatever. She’d say good morning every day because she got up earlier. We’d share songs, podcasts and actually listen and discuss them. Some of her recs were totally of no interest to me, but I listened for her. 

I learned about her small midwestern hometown, her uncle’s war stories, and her favorite candies. I told her about my elderly dog back home and what instrument I played in middle school.

Things just fell apart on the fourth date. After a few hours of great conversation she dropped the hammer on me with the “i’m not ready for a relationship and idk why I’m dating” lines. I was shellshocked. It came out of nowhere. There was nothing I said that she reacted badly to that I remember. She INSISTED on paying for drinks on several dates and did, I wasn’t being used as a meal ticket. 

She told her parents and sister about me and she even got express shipping on a dress once because she wanted to wear it to our date. We had 100 different dates planned. And she just ended it..poof.

Weeks after this ended, I’m in a constant state of emotional torment. Sometimes I have to take a break from work (wfh) to cry in my bed. I get excited when I receive a text for a split second when I hope it’s her but it’s always someone else. It’s only gotten worse.

I deleted her social media, number and our text convos. It hasn’t helped. Time hasn’t healed it, it’s gotten worse. I see friends and focus on work but I just think of her the entire time. I’m in therapy. And God, don’t tell me I need to “hit the gym”. I’m a long distance runner and have run 4+ miles every day for 5 years. 

I’m autistic, severely depressed, and anxious. I had accepted I’d be alone but I thought there was maybe a way out when I met her. I can’t do this and date again. It hurts too much. I wish I had never met her."

The track tracks would be my pillow and from the distance, miles and miles away, I'd be able to hear the vibrations of the train coming closer and closer. Like a mother humming her child to sleep, the murmurs of the rolling train would ease me sleep. I'd have my eyes closed, with nothing but the sweet sound of steel on steel to sing me to sleep.

I've met other people online so far thankfully, even other girls; i thought maybe i was feeling like that because i was lonely and i never had a gf so my virgin ass was acting up, but with the other girl i talk to i don't feel the same way. We don't really talk much at all nowadays, maybe once a week and for like 10 mins (we used to talk everyday all day), conversations are stale and boring af, so it only makes me feel lonelier. Can't even stop talking and delete her, so I'm feeling trapped"
ScrumptiousCookie123,lonely,1620423186.0,Finally found out why I’m alone.,"I found out that a group of people I used to know and grew up with conspired together, and ran me through the mud in a smear campaign. They impersonated me on Twitter and other social media platforms. At the time, I didn’t have any social media accounts. So I had no idea what was going on. I had no idea why others were angry/disappointed/disgusted/hateful/embarrassed with me. I didn’t understand why I was being scapegoated/ostracized/excluded. Everyone kept insisting that I needed to apologize. For what?! They wouldn’t even tell me what I did wrong. They would keep it super vague and say that I would disrespect everyone but demand others to respect me - in reference to the straw man impersonation they made of my identity. I never asked anyone to respect me. I was getting bullied, had no idea why, and couldn’t even defend myself. I simply was not allowed to defend myself.

I found out too late, and the damage was already done. Before I could make an account to report them on Twitter, they made sure to delete the tweets and deactivate those accounts. I wouldn’t be surprised if they made private impersonating accounts afterwards so I couldn’t see what was being posted.

They would use impersonating accounts to start fights, spread rumors/misinformation, and to misrepresent who I am as a person. 
Then, the same people who were impersonating me used their own accounts to refute/rebuttal the imposter/impersonating account - all to make themselves look like the “bigger person” and paint themselves in a better light. They would pretend to have “empathy” and “grace” when dealing with the straw man version of myself. 

I have so many questions...
Why are some people so awful? Why are some people so disingenuous?And why did people actually believe those impersonating accounts? Why didn’t people confront me in person and say anything about it? Why did people keep it hush, hush, and do all this behind my back? Why did it have to be me? I didn’t do anything to these people.

Experiencing this only brought me distrust and dislike people more. It also pushed me to write people off and generalize “everyone” as terrible, even though I know this isn’t true and there are good people out there. I feel super disheartened by this. 

The worst part is, even after being abused and done wrong by these individuals, I’m being medically pathologized/demonized/vilified as a “psychopath”, “narcissist”, “sociopath”, “borderline”, etc. I don’t have any of these diagnoses. They still go out of their way to make me out to be “evil” or an awful person who hurts others.

In reality, I’m socially withdrawn and “anti-social” (even though I’m sociable and friendly), because I’m super traumatized by what they put me through; I’m diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety."
lil-ice-monkey,lonely,1619888356.0,loneliness and stupid strong gal identity,"I \[F27\] identify so much with being ""a strong person"" that it has destroyed any chances of me getting what I really need - real human relationship, compassion, and support. I always attract traumatized people that need a lot from me emotionally and are unable to give back - as soon as I open up and take my armor off, I'm disposed of. I keep attracting them because essentially, it confirms my base belief - I am not worth anything, if not for my ability to help and support others, solve complex problems, be the ""sensible"" one.  


Multiple therapists have sent me home (aka ""I don't think you need another session"") because I appear to have my shit together, life is going on and my only problem, according to them, is that ""I am not accepting that feelings are normal"". Well, how could I, if nobody wants me if I have feelings? And I end the sessions because I'm so damn fucked in my head that I can't even let the therapist down for some reason.

I am not even ME anymore, so the phrase ""put yourself first"" makes no sense to me. I can't connect with anyone or anything. I look back at my life and any human relationship I have ever had seems like a temporary trip. I simply play the role everyone wants me to play - I am the one who ""puts things in order when they get out of order"".

I'm so lonely, I come home, cry and (secretly) drink myself to sleep. I've tried telling people I need support, but I just don't get taken seriously, because my image and *despair* don't go together well. I can't stop doing things actively, because I'm afraid that I might just kill myself if I stop doing things. I don't even know how to show people how lonely I am, and I'm almost 100% sure there is no chance of a good outcome.

How nice life would be if I had someone to relate to and share with. I just want to be cuddled up in a blanket. I just want someone to say ""I'll take care of everything"" and for me to be able to believe it. The more I think about it, the more impossible it seems. This doesn't even make any sense. Just wondering if being a ""lonely strong person"" is actually a thing."

KSenniaV,lonely,1620486507.0,Is love and acceptance from others vital for happiness?,"I don't know the answer to that. I was trying to help someone, the other day, by taking this tack of, ""you have deep needs that aren't being met, but other people can't actually meet those needs for you. You need to heal yourself.""

But I don't know if that's how it works. 

Is it possible for a person to be enough by themselves? Can they be happy and content and meet all of their own needs internally?

Or are there certain needs that can only be met by others? 

I learned from the Lifetime movie ""Child of Rage"", which was based on a true story about child killers, that attachment to our mothers or some other permanent caregiver in childhood is necessary for us to learn how to love, trust, and develop a conscience. 

So maybe love and approval from others is required, and we can't meet our own internal needs by ourselves.

I'm not sure.

I only feel lonely sometimes. It comes and it goes. But I've always been a loner who enjoys observing other people and making up stories about them in my head. 

But I have Aspergers (Autism Spectrum), so I've always struggled with communication and connecting with other people. 

I genuinely want to help people, but sometimes I can be off, or get really lecturey, or be too analytical. Or I'll just say the wrong thing and offend, unintentionally. Or I'll be too clingy, come on too strong, and drive people away. 

It just happens. Communication disorders are like that. I do try every day to learn and grow because learning and growing is my life's purpose. 

For me, I just kind of accepted a long time ago that I am not socially acceptable, and that most people won't like me, and that I'll never fit in, no matter which group I join. 

So I guess that has sort of innoculated me from the desperation of having friends or lovers. I'm also asexual, so I don't have that urge to procreate or have sex. I'm sure for sexual people who have that urge it must be a lot harder if you have trouble finding partners. 

When I was younger, I actually was quite desperate to find one person who loved me best. That was the thing I wanted most in the world. Then I had a wonderful fantasy relationship with someone that couldn't ever have actually happened because I didn't possess the actual abilities to make it happen.

But I got to experience what it was like to be in love and to believe someone else loved me, and to pretend I had a certain type of future. 

At the time I believed I was at the height of my existence. I didn't believe anything could ever live up to or surpass the love I'd felt. I became absolutely obsesses with this person, she was my entire world. Nothing else mattered other than her, and when she broke up with me, once she realized I wasn't real, I didn't think I could ever be happy again.

I very dramatically cried every day for two years, I talked about it constantly. I couldn't think about anything else. I think partly because of my autsyism, but also maybe that's normal-ish? *shrugs*

I don't know. It's been ten years. I'm alone and glad of it. I read the relationship subs and there is sooo much drama and angst and horrible things that happen. I'm thankful I can be independent, and that I'm not tied down to anyone. 

Maybe it's my age. I'm 38. So middle-aged, or very close. I know that the relationship/family thing was never going to be mine, and I kind of struggle to understand now why other people want it so desperately?

Is it an age thing?
A Society thing? Peeps grow up seeing that others are all coupled up and having families, so they feel like they have to have that, too?
Is it a biological imperative?
Is it a deep psychological need?

Do most people need to be loved and accepted by others before they can love and accept themselves? 

Or is it possible to meet all of our internal needs ourselves? 

I still have no idea. And I have a broken brain, so I have no idea how it works for the normal-brained. (Neuro-typical)

But anyhow, I mostly wanted to apologize, in case I give anyone really bad advice. It's not my intention to be hurtful. I really just want to understand. And because I don't understand, I may some stupid shit that doesn't make any sense. Maybe the next thing I say will be smart. :D"

Geodude074,lonely,1620128387.0,Last Action Hero was Arnold’s best movie ever,"Yes it was even better than T2. No I’m not joking. Hear me out.

LAH was an action comedy that frequently broke the fourth wall and was a completely original masterpiece that was also a parody of itself and was way ahead of its time. It had Tywin Lannister as the bad guy, Random Task as the henchman, a literal cartoon cat as a cop, a freaking Shakespeare skit, and of course Arnold as the wise cracking never ending source of dad jokes.

Look at the most successful action movies of the past decades i.e. Marvel, they’re all action comedies. The best ones are self aware and make fun of themselves and their own characters. The heroes are as humorous as they are ass-kicking, and the bad guys are literal comic book villains. LAH was simply ahead of its time, born in an age where action movies had to be serious, the audience of the 90s wasn’t ready for a comedic action hero Arnold.

It’s a shame LAH got stomped at the box office by Jurassic Park. It was completely original and never got a sequel. And because it never became a franchise that Hollywood could milk bone dry, LAH will always be a pure, golden 90s action parody, a timeless classic."

Maybe it’s because I have no goals in my life (for now) and just want to make them everything my life is about ? Or maybe it’s because being around friends makes me feel so left out.

Flashy-Throwaway,lonely,1620180079.0,I’ve been lonely for such a long period that I don’t even crave for people caring about me anymore.,"Loneliness is such a foreign concept for Chinese people because we are all being forced into social events all the time. I feel different, I feel like I can’t get any real friends out of these situations. 

For a long time I craved for relationships with almost everyone so that I won’t be able to feel lonely. Unsurprisingly I didn’t get anyone because my eagerness might’ve scared everyone off. 

Now I don’t believe in relationships because I probably am not qualified for getting any. I began craving for sex because that’s a easier way to relieve. Having sex with people might ruin even the slightest relationships I’ve had with them but... whatever. “I want nothing but sex out of our relationships.”"

Psychological_Job_97,lonely,1620550799.0,Quarantine loneliness affecting productivity. How do you all cope up?,"Been feeling lonely lately. I live alone in a big city. I go to work twice a week even though I can have the option to work from home. It just makes me feel better to see other people and sometimes my work friends. I want to go home, 500 miles away and gotta take a plane, but I don't have a space to work peacefully there and my dad's having extramarital issues. I'm still angry with him. My mom works abroad. I got no sibs. My SO and I would exchange messages and eventually she'd be busy. Of course, that's fine she's got a life too you know. I kinda hate myself for needing other people's presence just to be fine. 

Several holidays passed already and I badly wanna spend it with family or close friends but with the strict pandemic protocols, I can't do it. It has been like this for more than a year. I'm seeing a therapist to somehow work things out (loneliness, family issues, etc). She said I've been improving real great. Yet, there are times like this I just feel lonely. No friend to contact because they have a life too. After a year of lockdowns, seems like everybody's moved on already. 

I have lots of time in my hands but I can't use it productively esp on weekends where I intend to use it for studying(I'm also in grad school, part time). On days I go to work physically, I'm super productive. I miss my pre-pandemic self. Working on a full time and a part time job while taking classes for grad school. Writing papers to submit on conferences and journals. I feel bad about myself for being unproductive despite all the tools and opportunities available. It's just I couldn't bring myself to it.

novacaine21,lonely,1620582548.0,I feel extremely lonely when I'm with my close.family.,"I, 24m, am staying with my family of mom and sis, during the entirety of the COVID enforced lockdowns at my place. I'm not really used to spending so much time with them, as I grew up away from home (in residential schools) when I was 14 or so. Having an abandoned father didn't help much either for the dysfunctional family. Naturally, I felt more at ease and at home when I'm surronded by my friends than I felt when I was with family and relatives.

So, when I going back to my family, its like visiting a relative or something. The first few days its all well and good. But then later on, actual feelings start to surface. This deep melancholy and a feeling that I'm truly alone even though I'm with my close family. It gets worse when my mom starts to complain that I'm not smiling or talking much or whatever.

Now without any idea on how long I'm going to be locked up here, it gets even sadder day by day."
LostSouluk2021,lonely,1620425483.0,Below average means invisible in this society," If your below the conventional standard of perceived beauty you're essentially a ghost in this society, at least for many people. Any perceived flaw in your physical or mental makeup be it weight, height, skin, big nose, depression, schizophrenia etc is considered a deformity, maybe not overtly so but subconsciously it's how you're perceived. Age is also a factor because that's tied to appearance. There's definitely a subconscious prejudice against older people and if you're in a care home then expect to be patronised like you're a toddler by the 20 something care lady.  


Yet society won't tell you any of this. Society exists in a bubble of ignorance to maintain the ""perfect picture"". Sure mental health doesn't discriminate against even the most attractive people but society is still in their favour based on shallow preconceptions. Confidence and status can maybe defy any physical shortcomings but this life in general is so much bleak for people who are below average in some form or another."
AnonPinkLady,lonely,1620284805.0,"Loneliness is a bearable but constant ache, heartbreak is a brief but overwhelming agony","This seems to be the reason I never end up escaping the clutches of loneliness and putting myself back out there. It hurts all the time and in the grand scheme of things it's a much greater amount of pain to endure but its seems so slight, moment to moment, that I feel as if I can endure it. Mean while putting myself out there could mean happiness for a moment but if I get hurt and shot down, a much sharper more difficult pain even if it's short lived. Which is why I cant help fearing it. I'd compare loneliness to a chronic soreness in your muscles, while heart ache is a sudden stunning slap to the face. One hurts in a gradual way that doesnt make you feel startled or suddenly aware of it. The other is immediately and dizzying. You remember it. You fear it. Even though it's not as frequent as the dull ache, it's so much more obvious and unforgettable. So you choose the dull ache indefinitely, for days... months... years... you hurt. It's not your fault, its instinct to fear the slap more. But I wish I had the bravery, myself, to face it again."
Werbezeugvu,lonely,1620117961.0,Can I meet someone on the internet who will like me?,"Hi, I (25m) have been lonely my entire life. I had a couple of relationships with a few girls for a short time, but it didn't end well. In fact, I was riducled by them because of my timidity and devotion to them. Yeah, I guess it was pretty weird for them to talk with me.

&#x200B;

I understand that my main issue is that I'm too sensitive, and women around me don't like it all. I get attached to people easily and am an open book when it comes to my feelings, sadly often not thinking about the consequences. I don't wanna wait a long time to become an important person in one's life, so girls tend to consider me too intense and ghost me. Just can't control this. One of my ex-GFs told me that I will never be happy if I continue being like this, and she's probably right. I was trying to change my personality to become less sensitive, but it didn't help much. I can't fix my romantic nature, and it seems I never will.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I don't think I need to be so depressed about it. I have a very cool job, I travel a lot, and I'm in great shape. I think it would be great to find someone who will accept my personality. But I don't really know from where to begin. I've never used dating websites to meet anyone, even Tinder, because I know they're full of fakes or scammers. I guess most of you will understand what I'm talking about. The only thing I ever used for searching someone was [hubite.com](https://hubite.com) to find some girls in my locations who make kind of sensitive pics. It was just for fun and I didn't mean to talk with them or smth like that.

&#x200B;

I'm too skeptical about dating websites, but maybe I should give them a chance. What do you think? Should I try to find someone there or it's better to meet people IRL?"

 But i was tired to feel like that, feeling in two extremes, so i tried to explain was happend to me, and my explanation was that I had to entities who influenced my feelings, i give them names, and my ""solution"" was create a third entity who was more neutral.

Laying in bed spooning with their soft breaths in a slow and quiet cadence, their soft skin brushing against mine, the gentle warmth and relaxation that you only feel in your partner as they trust you enough to sleep with them, their hair always getting in the way and tickling your nose but you don't mind because you get to smell their clean sweet scent of their shampoo from their recent shower, and most importantly the serenity of feeling cared for.

Basically I feel like I’ve failed miserable in life. The only thing I can say I am proud of and brings me joy is my son who has unfortunately seen me in too many depressed states. He’s only 6 and he knows when something is wrong.
From an early age I was just quiet withdrawn and miserable. 

My dad committed suicide a year and a day later an ex died the same way. He had txt to meet me but I refused as I had moved on.

I tried college and didn’t work as my mother wouldn’t let me move to be closer to it, she would let me do anything but keep her home with her.

I went into a long term relationship and had my son. 11 years I spent with him and only my son to show for it. No engagement no home nothing. I was done I was miserable as was he but refused to admit. Wasn’t til after we broke up I realised how manipulative and toxic he was. And he made my life miserable. 

From there it’s getting worse. I don’t wanna be here anymore but don’t want to leave my son.

I'm not close with my family. I'm also not a good looking and it's my biggest insecurity. There are many things that I don't like about myself.

I can't make friends online or offline, I have tried joining multiple communities and doing new hobbies, but I always feel left out.

My Discord and Steam lists are empty, I have no one to talk to or play with. I try my best to socialise, but it has always ended up with me feeling humiliated.

I can't talk to people, my sentences are stiff and conversations with me are dry. I don't know how to express emotions properly and people don't want that. It's hard to initiate a conversation, and I've been told I have an awkward vibe around me. I don't want to put that kind of baggage on a friend.

I'm over the moon when someone talks to me, but I'm always ghosted at the end. I have had friends before, we always drift apart. I've tried to reconnect with one of them, but they expressed no interest in doing so.

The worst part is not knowing; did I do something wrong? Did I say something? Did they genuinly get really busy? Or do they just not want to be friends and don't have the courage to tell me straight? I'm done with people. People are so unreliable around me. Maybe it's me."

Since then I haven’t been able to make a deep connection to a partner. I don’t know if I’m the problem, if I’m not going for the right partners, or really what the issue is.

I figure dating in an online space may be a happy compromise. I can make a real connection with someone, get to know them as they know me. And explore emotional intimacy with some safety. 

 But Tinder is a crap shoot, COVID messed up any in person events, I feel really unlucky. I want to try a real relationship again I just don’t know where to go."

There’s only one person who checks up on me, that’s my mom. I’m very thankful for that, but it sucks because the rest of my family could care less about how I’m doing. It almost feels uncomfortable talking to my mom sometimes because of that. I just don’t feel good vibes from anyone either. If I do, it’s super temporary.

So over the weekend I found out my wife had a threesome years ago (4/5) with a close group friend We’ll call him (H) I shouldn’t care but it’s that I got this information from his brother who told me as if everyone knew about this, I confront my wife about it and she admits it but is shook on how I found out. At the time when that happened we weren’t together, we were broken up and she says it was a drunk mistake, I can get passed it happened a long time ago but I trusted this guy with my own kids literally. His wife (who also knew about this cause he told her) and all these years I see H and just the thought now that I would be at work and they would come over. My biggest problem was that it was kept away but I feel like everyone knew but me, his brother ended up telling H, all of our group friends as well and now they all know (it’s like 8 of us) I’m shook to my core because to this day they are really close friends and it makes it worse cause H asked my wife to be his best man (weird choice) I asked my wife if she was still going to be in H’s wedding as the best man and she said yes. I’m so conflicted because at times I let it go and I feel okay but sometimes my thoughts get terrible and I go down in a spiral and she doesn’t exactly comfort too well, I was in my feelings and I said something I regret but before I could tell her I didn’t mean it she responded with a worse comment and it started an argument. I don’t feel like she cares about any of this about how it’s affecting me in my head and all those things she said in our argument I took to heart. Now everything just sucks and I’m just mad all together and hurt. Sorry if it’s complicated I just don’t know what to say or if I’m in the wrong. Again my problem was that I found out now, my wife asked me for all my experiences when we weren’t together and I asked her and she didn’t bring this up. That wasn’t too long maybe a few months when we opened up about that topic"
urnice123,lonely,1619959876.0,Idk im depressed or not. Help me!!!,"

From few months, I’m surfing reddit alot and found eventually a dating sub reddit. I’m horrible in real life dating even though im lil attractive but still I couldn’t get into any relationship because im very shy. You don’t know the level of shyness. I thought of finding some serious relationship and someone kind girl and someone who can love me from his heart on reddit and I actually got quite good response but after few days girls don’t give efforts in communication and they get ghost. I feel really sad when im the only one who messages them. They won’t care even if I don’t message them. They won’t even message me first and give replies after an hours so I dropped on them. I found so many such girls who don’t give efforts in communication. Now the main part is im addicted toward seeing messages. In every 15 mins i check my reddit and discord to see if someone message me or not. I just keep waiting for someone to message me and no one messages me. I feel really lonely. My dating intention isn’t wrong. I just want one girl who can care for me and message me but I couldn’t find them. Every morning i woke up i open my discord and reddit to see if anyone sent me message or not. Idk it’s depression or not but i def feel really lonely. My life is pretty good. I got many people care for me but because of that im losing my one genuine friend also. I just try to keep my face happy but from deep down i feel void in my heart. This is the new account i created just to post this. I don’t want any person to know that i feel lonely because of those people who hadn’t given effort in communication either way they won’t care. I’m just tired of this nonsense. I’m just tired of finding love. I’m just tired of everything. If you’re read till end. I hope you find happiness in your life.

z3brother,lonely,1620415132.0,Just need to vent,"My earliest memory is from when I was 3 years old, sitting alone on the bench at school watching everyone else play together. When my best friend walked by I called out his name but he kept ignoring me, covering his ears with his hands. I’m not blaming a 3 year old here, I just remember feeling invisible.

I have no siblings and my parents are workaholics that don’t stop after their long hours. My wider family are extroverts, so I just fade into the background.

I had quite a lot of friends in my early teens, but we grew apart. I spent most of my mid-late teens alone, whether it was in my room, at school, in public or going to events.

I’m now in university and I’ve been noticing how alone I am recently. Today was like any other day: I left the house without talking to anyone, I got the bus alone, I sat alone in my lecture, I ate lunch alone despite two of my sort-of-friends being close by. I went home alone, my parents asked how my day was but they didn’t really listen, I ate dinner alone, and now i’m in my room alone.

I thought there was something wrong with me, so I lost a lot of weight, cut and dyed my hair, got cosmetic work done, changed my style and just pretended to be someone else.
I hate myself, absolutely detest everything about myself inside and out now. I’m in so much pain that I just don’t feel pain anymore really. I don’t expect anything from anyone anymore, I just exist. 

I am so tired of it and I feel like it’s never going to change, I have tried many times, failed and tried again so many times but nothing ever works. I’m just permanently invisible"

shwannah,lonely,1620355183.0,Rejection back to back,"I was dumped after a 2 year relationship 4 months ago.. 2 months after the breakup I started talking to this girl and we began a pretty healthy, very casual, and mature relationship.. we both just kind of acted as a source of connection/romantic interest for each other, not taking it too seriously but it was so nice to have. I know people say rebounds are not a good idea, but this felt, on both our ends I think, pretty low stakes and distracted us from our breakups. We'd both been crying about them for 2 months so we wanted some relief, I think and liked each other enough. Then it exploded. We slept together and there was some shit with STD exposure and she broke things off yesterday. Getting ""dumped"" twice in 4 months feels so bad. It is so hard to transition from being in--even a casual--relationship to being fully single. I'm not trying apps again. But I want nothing more now than to text my ex and ask her to cuddle with me.. I'm lonely and sad."

And honestly in the beginning of our relationship it started during the lock down so we we’re always in the house an barely tried to speak to one another. Maybe the normal everyday talk but that was it. We often fought over small things as well and it was unhealthy. We really never took the time to really get to know one another to be friends first then move in together it was rushed. I still want to be with him to start over because I love him and he say he still love me but he doesn’t want to be with me. It’s going to hard not having him around but at least we can be friends and I can text him. But for now I think it’s best we split for a bit.

I’ve experienced women literally walk the other direction from me when I approach at parties and such. It always has made me wonder what is wrong with me leading to uncontrollable overthinking about minuscule social interactions and constant questioning towards my appearance, personality, etc. My parents have always told me that I would find that someone who would love me forever but I’m starting to believe that the statement has no truth to it whatsoever.

On their social media, they can be married to someone for years, but only post selfies of their face. We’ve become such a narcissistic self induced society.

EquivalentWest5678,lonely,1620381257.0,The package and the hole,"(This is not a confession, nor mine. I am simply curious what people think about someone who would right this.)

I spent years of my life, my primary, my secondary; dreaming and conceptually asking for a lie. The few things that gave me happiness were nothing more than little packages that promised on their surface to give me that which I had not had for most of my life as a student. As soon as I opened these packages I realized all the disgusting things they had inside, it was not only the same indifference, ignorance and impurity that I had tried to disregard throughout my life, but also, it was the celebration and appreciation of all these things I had hated. The worst of the case is that I had asked for that miserable package and I do not know if it was out of fear or the lack of interest with which I had become used to living my days that I did not open the door to receive it until what it contained was irretrievably expired. I wonder if in the future it will be for me, as for so many people that once time passes and the contents of the package are fermented in a substance that causes them the same illusion of happiness that my dreams of the future caused me, that I will finally appreciate the false happiness brought by the pleasant lie that temporarily fills that very hole in which we will end up. The same hole that has been my home for a long time, where I have found some tranquility and calm, this hole has the name of loneliness. It is easier to hide in the darkness of this hole where my dreams and fantasies are perfect than to go outside where imperfections are so revered. Once in a while like a diver whose oxygen tank runs out, I would go outside to breathe, but when I did I was naturally so disappointed that I dug that hole more and more. I isolated myself to such an extent that those who originally saw me dig my hole with indifference, now whispered to each other and began to mock that lonely miserable digging his hole. It is incredible the fear that causes me to get out of that hole to meet the expectations of those who laugh, even though I don't like to think about it, I wonder: if I continue digging this hole will it be my grave?"
Rohifi,lonely,1620369351.0,Better to put up walls first or welcome all and ghost the awfuls?,"Just something I’ve been thinking about:

If I put up walls to potential friendships upfront, I will only be contacted by/engaged in meaningful conversation with folks I already have real good odds of hitting it off with and feeling safe around; however, this means that most of my posts that are seeking some kind of connection mostly go ignored or invite hateful replies/dms.

Not always, sometimes they do seem to work and I’ll be approached (here on reddit) by a seemingly like-minded, kind-hearted person.

But, fuckin’ hell, the waiting, questioning, and yes loneliness between these rare connections can often be overwhelming!

Conversely, if I were to just chat up every post which even remotely caught my eye (extroverted introvert by social necessity), or made my own posts more generic and crowd-pleasing/baiting, I’d probably experience a lot more basic, first-step hellos but would then have to suss out who each person is at a fundamental, will we even vibe level. And then if we don’t, I have to decide to tell them why and bail or just ghost entirely — in that situation I’d usually tell the reason unless it’s a truly heinous person who’s not even worth the courtesy of the truth.

So which method is better? I guess it depends on what kind of loneliness I’m really looking to ease.

Not sure why I’m posting this other than to just get the thought out, and maybe to see if anyone has thoughts of their own to add."

totalynotathrowavvay,lonely,1620609924.0,Fill the void,"I just want to punch a hole through my chest so that unbearable void would fill in. This void is sucking everything out of me. Nothing's worse then running into ppl that make you feel more alone then you felt before.

&#x200B;

And then there's those that say ""Oh, but before you try to be around others you must first learn to be alone with yourself and to learn to love yourself"". This makes no sense to me, it's like saying ""if you are afraid your house might burn down, just burn it yourself""... defeats the purpose. Been alone for over a decade, had enough of it. Why should I go back and get better at being alone instead of reaching out and meeting ppl in the hopes that 1 day I will run into someone with who I have a mutual positive influence on each other. Why do ppl keep giving this advice? Seen it many times, even got it myself a few. If I've been eating carrot soup every day for 10 years and I finally say I had enough of it and look for other food, would it be not normal to be pissed and frustrated if others tell me ""the problem is not the soup, it's you, you have to learn to enjoy your soup"". Why?!?! the more I kep at it the worse it will get! Well shit, if I enjoyed being alone why would I look for others? And if I didn't, why would I try to force myself to get used to it when it's not the only option? Why force myself to learn to endure something I hate or is causing me pain, on myself, if I don't absolutely have to? It's like being advised to adopt toxic thinking and to some degree, self harm!

I understand I'm quite off the rails and would take ages to actually find someone I get along with and also not feel lonelier while being around. But is this a mirage? As I tend to feel that someone spending time with me, would be better of around other that would be a better influence and better company overall. So eventually the guilt of having a negative impact/wasting someone's life(time) would make it impossible to get along even with someone that would be a theoretical perfect match? But I'm ok with who and what I am and learned to accept it a long time ago, so this should not be an issue, right? Yet it still is... I can learn to ignore it or live with it. It will be there forever though, ain't it? Is this what ppl talk about when they say ""a true friendship is 60%-40% where both try to contribute 60%""?

doubleu222222,lonely,1620014888.0,Birthday Blues,"I always get so weepy and sad the week leading up to my birthday. I've had to plan two different birthday parties for two different people this week, one being held in my house, and yet no one is able to do anything to celebrate my birthday on Wednesday.I love my friends and am happy to celebrate them I just wish I felt some of that love and care reciprocated. I feel like I can't even fully be mad because they all have work and other responsibilities but it still makes me sad to spend my birthday alone.  

The only friends I've made and been able to hang out with the past year are actually all my roommates coworkers / friends. My roommate and I used to be best friends but lately I've noticed he doesn't try to spend any time with me or even look up from his phone when I talk to him. Having to rely on him for a friend group makes me feel like a burden and he's even made comments in the past when he feels like I'm getting too close with one of his friends or says things like he should have never introduced me to them. We've been friends since highschool, going on 10 years, but I just don't feel like I have a place in his life anymore but it's so difficult to let go of. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Even just putting it down into words helped me. I hope you all know you're worthy of love and companionship even if it's not around right now."

JustAnotherLonleyGuy,lonely,1620144959.0,I(M25) lost my only friend (F24) and just feeling sad for myself," This might be a bit longer and I am not a native English speaker or a good writer so bare with me

For background we are somewhere in Canada and both of us are immigrants(different home countries) both has history of going through tough times in our individual phases. We became friends about 8 months ago.

We used to talk everyday regular replies were common from both of our sides. Since we had traumatic pasts we usually get mental breakdown from time to time and as good friends usually do we talk each other out whenever needed. Mostly I get such mental issues because I am working at most toxic workplace that wont pay enough and need to work way too much (I do it for permanent residency other immigrants know what I am talking about).

Fast forward to March 1st week, we were talking regularly as usual and I was up all night in the morning she texted me around 4 in the morning (S stands for her, M stands for me) this is where I think everything went wrong but it must be my overthinking I am not sure!

S: hey good morning I am up super early.  
M: well I wasn't able to sleep unfortunately.  
S: you are still up what happened?  
M: try to sleep for sometime I will tell you later in the day, it is too much to sink in at 4 in the morning  
S: ok have a great day  
\*few hours later I text her what was wrong and what lead me to not sleep throughout the night\*

She did not reply for few hours and as she usually tries to calm me down and give the hopes that everything will be alright and so on.

But I noticed that now she was not replying to me as normally as she usually would, sometimes would take hours or even a day or 2. I thought she might be busy and her school exams were up so probably studying for that.

Fast forward around 3 weeks ago, thing were same she would reply late and would just ask me if I can help her with her assignments and what not that I usually help her with.

S: I am kind of feeling low  
M: you want to talk about it? I am always here if you want to vent it out  
\*No replies for a day\*  
M: hey everything ok there? I am worried for you now?  
S: I am feeling ok, my grandma is sick taking care of her  
M: feel free to let me know if I can be of any kind of help? Do you mind keeping me updated?  
\*No replies for 2 days, I thought she is busy and didn't want to be bothered\*  
M: hi, how is everything with you family everyone doing good? Always remember you have a friend that is always worried for you (She sometimes thinks that nobody cares for her)  
\*No reply throughout the day\*  
S: I am good, grandma is good. I am just binge watching on Netflix.  
M: Sounds good, carry on!

Few days past without no texts being exchanged, a night came when I was feeling low

M: I am feeling low  
\*few hours past\*  
S: I am sorry wanna talk? I've been just studying for the tests whole day  
M: sorry I didn't know that, please carry on I shouldn't have bothered you in the first place.  
S: are you mad at me?  
M: no I will not be mad at you like ever, I just want to tell someone that I was upset and your name stroke my head, sorry for disturbing you  
S: are you ready for your work tomorrow?  
M: as if I was good enough for a better job  
\*she liked my message\*  
M: I am sorry, don't be mad at me for this  
\*next day evening\*  
M: sorry for last night, I hope I haven't blown up our friendship  
\*no replies for 2-3 days\*  
S: can you help me with this test?  
M: sure  
\*we did the test and scored good (over 85%)\*  
S: can you help me with another test  
M: sure  
\*after 2-3 questions she did not reply at all and after 3 days and last day of semester\*  
S: almost done with the semester only 1 assignment left, can you help me with this? It is due tonight  
S: omg I just noticed it is due at 9  
\*it was a project and the time was 6\*  
M: no worries we can get it done together  
S: I am failing this course  
M: we can get it done chill  
It was a group project should be done by a group of 2-4 members  
M: It says group members names should be written here, can you give me their names?  
S: I am alone  
\*project was done like 30 minutes before the due time\*  
S: what will I be able to do without you?  
M: I guess we will never find out, I will not let you alone, ever!!

After this she would usually reply once or twice everyday or every second day.

Fast forward to earlier this week (Saturday).

M: do you have few minutes to talk?  
\*after like 4 hours\* (note: from now on all her replies are after the duration of about 20 minutes to 1 hour)  
S: sorry I was talking nap what's up?  
M: does it feel like I am forcing a conversation on you and you just don't want to answer me, did I do something to upset you?  
S: why would you say that?  
M: you don't reply for sometimes days and the other night you left me on seen and throughout the night I was just wondering if you are mad at me and you will probably never talk to me again  
S: I am sorry, I am just binge watching on Netflix, and my notifications are also off.  
\*we had a deep conversation that night with the same late replies duration\*  
(Sunday)  
M: why have you never given up on me?  
(Monday)  
I was at the client location she started working there, and her colleague called me to fix something.  
I was her and said Hi, and did my thing and left  
S: why were you in such a rush  
M: sorry I thought I was done, did you want something?  
S: just wanted to say hi,  
M: I said Hi to you and you never replied! I can come back after my work ends I will be around the corner for some groceries  
S: no that's fine  
M: ok  
S: I know I haven't answered you, I don't know what I want to answer  
M: you don't have to answer/reply if you don't want to. I've been pushy lately it's ok I understand.

Its been a day now and she has not messaged me. I am starting to think the she will never message me now and the friendship is done.

Something to understand from my perspective, I never took more than like 20 minutes to reply, especially when she needed support, help etc. So not that I am re reading some of the texts, I feel a bit insulted that she prioritized Netflix over replying to me.

I do understand that she does not need to talk to me day and night but replying after few days? Especially after talking day and night and discussing about our day? Is it weird only for me?

Now I am just sitting waiting for her text, I do want to just tell her that this was so upsetting for me but I feel like I will be ignored forever.

I am thinking that this is just my overthinking mind saying everything, so here I am trying to cry my heart out to kind reddit strangers. I do like her was planning to ask her if she wants to be more that friends, but before that I have to get a better job which is a bit difficult because 1) Immigrant(yes companies do not accept immigrants as their employees, only those who do are immigrants as well and know that employees will do anything to keep their job) 2) COVID-19

Then this girls abusive exboyfriend starts bothering. He went to her job and made a scene just because he found out she was dating someone. I let it go and thought it was just a one time thing jealousy act. About a week ago he starts texting her insulting her and insulting me.  After years of loneliness, depression, and just pure darkness, I finally have someone who I enjoy being with and who cares about me as much as I care about her, and this motherfucker who used to abuse her thinks he's gonna get away with doing the same shit. So I called the guy and asked him where he was and see what happens to all his macho attitude. He didn't wanna tell me. I stalked him on social media a bit and found out where he works. Went to his job so that he could see I was being serious, but I lost it and beat him up bad. I got arrested. I'm currently out on bond and eating for a court date. I'm the dumbest person alive.

I now realize the cops should have handle it and not me. I feel like I threw my whole life away, now that I will have a criminal record. I so fucking self destructive. I hate myself. I've never even been violent. I got bullied from middle school through high school and never did anything. I don't know what got into me. I'm so fucking depressed again. I don't even wanna leave my room, I would end it all if it wasn't because I know how much my parents would suffer and my dog needs me. "

I considered them to be my best friend. Then we graduated and went our separate ways. Our jobs took us to different cities. Covid hit and we lost touch. Recently figured I would hit them up again. I mean I still consider them my best friend. Maybe we could reconnect. The last thing they said to me was “I’ll miss you”. Never before in my life has a friend said that to me. So it meant a lot.

I sent them just a brief catch-up message and they opened it and then...nothing. That was a month ago. Left on read. It sucks. Realizing oh. It’s been too long. We aren’t friends anymore."

It sucks being in a big city because I constantly have fear of missing out. I can’t go out for a walk without seeing people getting dinner or laughing with friends, SOs, colleagues etc. I have none of those.

I hate my job and coworkers and will leave in the next year (it’s too early to leave yet), I have one good friend and he is moving out of the city in a few months. I have no luck dating (no matches and no desire to continue dating).

Life just sucks. I can’t connect with anyone and never could. Not in high school, college or now. All my relationships just seem superficial. I never had a good friend.

I just thank god for weight lifting because that is the only thing keeping me going everyday otherwise there is no purpose. I just love seeing my progress and the familiar faces of regulars but strangers in the gym.

I know nobody cares and I never post here but hoping it will at least be cathartic for me. I just hope one day I meet someone (a friend or girlfriend that gives me meaning otherwise I won’t be much longer). It sucks being lonely in a big city."

Degenerate_Senpai,lonely,1620192771.0,I never want to fall in love or have crushes ever again [SUPER LONG RANT],"This may seem like a childish statement, but I've experienced just enough to not want to pursue another relationship or ask out another woman again. I may only be 19 years old, and there may be some of you who'll say something along the lines of ""you have your whole life to fall in love"" or whatever, but I don't want to go through the trials and tribulations of such.

I knew a girl back in middle school; let's call her Christina. We started becoming friends after our friend circles started colliding. Best way to describe her: imagine that shy, nerdy, cute girl you secretly had a crush on when you was 12 or 13. That was basically her in a nutshell, so you can imagine how surprised and happy I was when Christina asked me out. I said yes, and we became a couple. Throughout our relationship, though, she was shy to do a lot of things. She was shy to hold hands and hug in front of people. So, when it came to the times Christina kissed me on the cheek, it took a lot of courage for her to do so. As for me, I was patient and told her time and time again we can do intimate things only when she was 100% comfortable with it. (As you'll come to find out, Christina was the type of girl to expect me to do the complete opposite of what I said.) A bit later in our relationship, Christina became distant when it came to talking and being around me. When she wasn't saying anything despite my insistent asking, I had no choice but to turn to my friends. Turns out, they were trying to find a way to tell me: Christina was cheating on me. And, sure enough, she was. And, to put it simply, she was NOT a shy person whatsoever. Christina is the type of girl who wanted to be dominated by a man rather than being with someone who was patient; I didn't fit that persona she wanted me to be, which led to her telling me the reason why she cheated on me was because ""I didn't act like a man."" Also, she was going through developments in her sexuality that made her loose attraction to me, and she thought ignoring me was going to get me to leave her alone. With that being said, I was played from the beginning. Christina asked me out, only to not be honest with me when it came to how she wanted to be treated or being open about the changes in her sexuality, but rather, chose to cheat on me despite her initiating our relationship.

Something similar happened with another girl I dated during my sophomore year of high school; let's call her May. May and I have known one another since the summer before our freshman year, and became friends within our friend circle. May experienced a rough breakup during our freshman year when her ex cheated on her. So, cut to our sophomore year, May got ahold of my phone number and asked me out. She was another girl who I secretly had a crush on, and she's been having a crush on me for about a year or so, so I said yes. We were both busy in our lives, so it took a lot of energy from both of us to be with one another. Until, she broke up with me through text out of the blue. And, she went back to her ex, only to break up with him again when he cheated again. Basically, May asking me out was based on a quick impulse, based on the small crush she's had on me for so long. And, our relationship was nothing but a void to fill while May was still healing from a breakup, only to go back to the guy who already established himself as not loyal. My time was wasted yet again in maintaining another relationship that would mean absolutely nothing. 

You may notice that these relationships only began because I was being asked out, and not the other way around. I have asked out women in the past, only to be rejected every time I did. I never had a problem with being rejected or anything. It's okay when a girl doesn't like me, but the last time I asked out a girl is somewhat scarring to me based on the end result. I was friends with another girl back in high school, let's call her April, and we've been knowing one another since the eighth grade. So, we've known one another for a while. There was one point in our friendship where April and I were very close, and our friends saw something in us. (They never told her this, as far as my knowledge grants me. It was something they verbalized to me a lot at the time.) I wanted to ask April out, and it seemed like my friends read my mind when they were encouraging me to do so. So, I did. Only to be rejected. I'm okay with the rejection, except, she ghosted me from that moment on. It seemed like the close friendship we've had for years at that point just disappeared. She would always run away from me whenever we spotted one another in the hallway and among our friend circle. She would turn her head suddenly when we happened to meet eyes with one another in the hallway or if we were grouped in an activity together. Her silent treatment worked up until our graduation. During our silence, April dated an older guy who was long graduated by the time we graduated. From what I've heard, April was cheated on a handful of times when her boyfriend started seeing older women behind her back, and a lot of conflicts rose within her friendships because of her relationship. That aside, I never received any closure as to why she treated me asking her out as such a bad, taboo thing. Or, what she saw in the guy she would eventually date in comparison to me. So, I only have my interpretations as to why someone would react so strongly to that, and to be with someone else so problematic for so long. It made me look at myself in a bad light:

""Two relationships failed. First girl cheated on me. Second girl used me until she wanted to go back to her cheating ex. Now, I done ruined a long lasting friendship. What's wrong with me? Am I that disgusting to women that I can be mistreated and ignored so badly? Do girls see me as that disgusting and meaningless to either cheat on me or be with someone else who will inevitably end up hurting them? Time and time again even! Meanwhile, I'm over here playing love guru to all my girl-friends (""friends who are girls"") who already have boyfriends. Why do people see my opinions in such a way to where I'm the only person to talk to about relationships? It would make people think that I too am deserving of experiencing at least one good relationship, shouldn't it? Or, to come across one girl who'll treat me right? But no. I should've known better. After how many rejections I had. After how many times girls I didn't even know called me ugly. I should no better than to believe I'm worthy of being in a good relationship, or finding a girl who truly reciprocates the same feelings as I. Having passions and goals in life - hell, not cheating on people - means nothing when girls always call you ugly and whatnot.""

To this day, I haven't asked out another woman again. There was one point, however, where it seemed like I was close to breaking my rule when I met a transfer student during my senior year. She quickly found a boyfriend. Nothing wrong with that, except, I had to play love-guru again to another one of my girl-friends who was having boyfriend issues. Call me petty, but is that all girls see me as? Someone not boyfriend material, but smart enough to at least having relationship advice? It seems contradicting. I'm at a point to where I don't even wanna go through the possibility of going through the same hurt and self-loathing all over again. It's not like things are gonna get easier just because I'm in college. It's hard to find loyalty in my generation. With the amount of toxic feminist mindsets that women are influenced by, and the physical standards men are now expected to have in order to be considered dateable. No matter how often I try to keep up with my appearance or keep myself busy with my education and planning out the ongoing development of my entrepreneurship, those generational obstacles are not going away. Unless, I hardwire myself to become one of those cheating guys those girls end up falling in love with. It's not worth the personality change. It's not worth the energy of making yourself appear a certain way towards women. It's not worth going through the hurt. I do want to be in a relationship, though, don't get me wrong. I find myself shamelessly listening to girlfriend ASMR videos through my headphones while I hug a pillow to sleep. But, as I've said many times before, it's not worth it."

H_241188,lonely,1620195834.0,My mother blamed me for being single,"EDIT: Thaaank you sooo much for the love and the positive messages. It made a whole difference 💗🙏 sending love to the supportive Reddit community 

I (32F) got used to hearing the “why are you still single” “why are you not married” “why are you not looking hard enough” questions and judgment from strangers

but a few days ago my mother dropped a bomb on me, that its my fault I’m single and not married by now.

That really hurt because I am not single by choice, i do want to be with someone and i do want the marriage, house and kids, so hearing that really put me down. I do cry a lot when feeling lonely so having someone close to you tell you its your fault messes with your brain.

As a parent aren’t you suppose to stick up to your children and encourage them that better things are coming... that was hurtful"
throwaway_wannadie,lonely,1620320998.0,"At a point where I have so much to share and pour my heart out over here but I don't even have the strength or energy to do that either, and it's breaking me even more.","Reddit is one of the best things that ever happened to me. I've always been an insecure lonely only child throughout my life because of various reasons, but reddit is the only place I've ever been able to truly open up and try to release all the morbid thoughts and stuff I have.
But nowadays, I seem to not be able to do that too. I feel like crying everyday at totally random moments nowadays, and hardly speak more than 500 odd words a day. Im starting to see morbidity in everything around me and given I'm already at rock bottom rn in my personal life because of various reasons, all these are just adding up. I'm going to sleep at 6am everyday coz I just end up staring at the ceiling all day long. 

And I don't even have the energy or will to post them on reddit anymore. I want to get so many thoughts of my chest but I can't seem to even articulate any of it nowadays or gather the will nd strength to post it.

And that's breaking me even more. Posting on reddit was the one small thing that used to give me joy nd a sense of a safety net, but even that's proving way too hard for me.
I know it may seem ironic that I ended up posting this on reddit, but it took me almost 45 mins just to make myself write this much, because I've meaning to all day, and it was breaking me too much that I wasn't even able to do it. Sorry for blabbering on.

Me and this girl I was in a long distance relationship with for over a year broke up in April. We were in a group chat together and when we broke up she left, and weeks later there was a misunderstanding between me and a friend so three people left. We’re good now, they’re just not back in the gc, so its not like it used to be. I have people to sit with at lunch in real life, 4 friends that ive known since last year, but outside of lunch we dont actually talk much. And when we do text it’s just casual. 

I’m in three other group chats and I met some people online, but I simply don’t feel a connection to anyone anymore. I don’t have any “real friends” I guess. At least it doesn’t feel like it. I know a few wouldn’t mind me ranting to them, but I also know they wouldn’t actually care-because for years now ive always overshared and now no one really takes me seriously.

It wasn't anything crazy, I just asked him if he had seen the new schedule put out at work (apparently he had quit last month so he in fact did not see the schedule). Then after our conversation he followed me back on insta. I was so excited when I saw he had followed me back (because he only follows people he is friends with/knows). So yeah that just made me super happy and excited!!"
123blueskies,lonely,1620593948.0,"Perpetual Uncertainty, deep down the loneliness burden.","Perpetual uncertainty, that's the name of the game.

 In recent days there has been a feeling of emptiness, but today it is already helplessness.
 I feel like I have lost the love and important feelings, and in general the superficiality around me kills me, and eats me from within.

 They are all pecked, addicted and fast.  And next to them I cry inside me and think ""until when"".  It is difficult to be next to them, to be aware of reality.  To be lonely.

 Being alone is nice, but sometimes life limits me.  My family is like a dying person who has long since lost consciousness, and I feel like a soul that wants to escape.
 It is difficult.  I am in uncertainty, want to escape, want peace.  But the factory draws me to it every day anew, and I sink into emptiness and destroy the personality within me.  It hurts me in development and it is harmful.

 And talking to her, it's a fear of talking that will become a burden.  The superficiality will make me lose humanity.  And I'll hurt.  Humanity is a thought, but it leads to reality.
 And I must hold on to it with all my might.  And meanwhile I feel pretty lonely.  Not because there is no one by my side, but because my thoughts are so different from the emptiness that surrounds me.  And if anyone could understand me, it would be a miracle.  It's so much confusion.
 Feeling tired, and also scared."
Pizzadrums,lonely,1620131840.0,Is keeping busy the right or wrong thing to do?,"I'm having really bad spells at the moment. This morning I was feeling so low I was having suicidal thoughts (I'd never go through with it).

But I've been reading a lot of Eckart Tolle lately and his lesson is learning to be with your thoughts, whatever they may be, coming back to the present moment etc.

I find that I need to be out of my house though... even if it's just going for a drive. That coupled with reassuring myself I won't be lonely forever is what gives me hope, not sitting in my house all day meditating.

Today for example... I've gone from feeling as low as ever this morning to now looking forward to going out for a drive when I finish work. Is this just masking my problems?"

DMonstrative,lonely,1620317642.0,Interpreting and Playing the Social Chess Game In Good Faith,"I could make this post trudge endlessly with uninterestingly self loathing or depriving anecdote/introspection, but that wouldn't be helpful. I don't have the complete picture to analyze my shortcomings because we all possess blinders, but I do have the best picture of anyone out there. After all, who knows us better than we know ourselves?

If I can shorten the point of this to my pursuit it would be the following:

Knowing full well that personal relationships require give and take in regards to effort and expressing interest and investment, I feel like any fair definition of friendship doesn't actually apply to any of my relationships at all. Some people call themselves my friends, and for certain periods of time I experience tiny group interactions a few times a year, but I don't know how to properly calculate the process of showing apathy v. overbearingness to maintain these friendships if they are indeed genuine. Where is the sweet spot? Or am I just really that boring and socially undesirable? Is it fixable?

To try to counter a holistically negative description for a bit, I have improved a lot as a person. I'm more responsible and confident than ever. I lost the 130 lbs I needed to lose from high school to have a healthy body and I'm pursuing a career to be a high school math teacher after being in professional doldrums for quite a few years. I have a lot of common interests with people and I've been told I'm personable and genuine, etc. A lot of those qualities are just a basis for everyone, though and don't stand on their own to be a desirable friend.....

The act of writing this even robs me of sympathy for myself, so rest assured that's not what I'm seeking. I would rather further my heuristic and sense making to navigating relationships in every environment because I want to be happy. Everyone ""says"" that, but i want to genuinely be happy and have meaningful relationships outside of just my birth family. Ultimately I want a family of my own, but that level of relationship is even further off so I'm trying to work my way towards being desirable in a less serious context first (I think).

The tl;dr version: I suck with people as evidenced by my loneliness and others' actions if not given to me by advice or truth telling by others. 

Question: What do you do to better yourself? How do you let go of inauthenticity and be comfortable in your own skin? How do you make the most of your life?"
SmartRecognition7158,lonely,1620102530.0,I have no one to talk to. My thoughts are starting to take over and I’m scared I might go insane,"I’ve never had anyone to talk to. I’ve always kept my thoughts in my head and it’s consuming me

I’ve always been alone, wanting more, wanting people in my life who want/care about me instead of being awkward around me

These past few months have been rough for me. So many people have told me nasty things and have whittled my self confidence down to absolutely nothing. And the icing on the cake is my girlfriends family telling me I’m a dumpy boyfriend and a bunch of other things.

My girlfriend doesn’t really listen because she never knows what to say. My best and only friend just doesn’t seem to care. And everyone else just gives me one word responses to my ranting

It hurts because people have ranted to me and I’ll ALWAYS listen

My parents either try to start an argument because I’m “wrong and young” or they try to give me life lessons instead of actually trying to listen or give me proper advice. They see me laying there all depressed and keep going on their business

Time and time again I’ve been told “I’m being dramatic” and I “think too much” but that’s all I have is my thoughts, I don’t have an outlet.

I’m too anti social for therapy I’ve tried multiple times but I can’t open up to strangers face to face. I’m so done with trying to express thoughts only to get shut down. I’m so done with everything

I know I know “I’m dramatic, I’m an adult, this is life, I’ve got to look out for myself” I’ve heard it all before. Just once I want to hear “you matter to me” or “I appreciate you coming to me to talk” I just want to feel welcomed in people’s life’s

I could barely piece together this post because I’ve got so many negative thoughts flooding my brain that need out and that’s my problem and why I scare people away. So sorry this post has been all over the place😬

Flame me all you want. but expressing my thoughts on the internet helps for a short amount of time🤟 

Probably deleting the post anyways tbh"

I also try friendship apps but people just give one word answers and don't ask anything about you or eventually start ignoring you without explaining why. when I tell people that I don't have any friends they either just give advice and act like I haven't been trying all that stuff my whole life or saying everyone is lonely even when they are surrounded by people and the whole world doesn't revolve around me. They also say things like to think about how it could be worse and I do that as well and try and count my blessings and be thankful but sometimes you get fed up of doing that.  I also hate that saying you have to love yourself before others can but what if you need someone to love you first to show you how to.

Catzillachan,lonely,1620601043.0,People you don't talk to for years and then contact you only to sell you something,"So today this girl who used to be my classmate sent me an invite to a facebook group. At first I was naive and wondering if she was putting together a reunion or something. We had mutual friends and would hang out in the same group sometimes. Then I thought ""wait no it's probably just a pyramide scheme or one of those 'invite 25 friends and win a prize' scams"". Sure enough, it was a group to sell and promote some soap she was producing. I declined the invitation. And it's probably petty of me, but I also unfriended her. This girl, I had to comfort her when her boyfriend danced with another girl at prom. I was by her side when her friends ditched her at sumner camp (they ditched me too, btw). Once she had a party where she invited everyone in our friend group and only included me because the teacher asked her to invite me. Another time we were going swimming with a couple of friends and she made a comment about my outfit that made me feel uncomfortable and insecure. I don't feel like I owe her anything. And maybe it was just that I felt particularly shit today, but I got really offended that she doesn't talk to me for years and then expects me to buy her soap. No.

I never hear from former friends and aquaintances who actually want to hang out. They all either need help or want to sell something. It just reminds me how unliked I am."
blblblblbll,lonely,1619923968.0,I feel like I am hitting a low point right now,"I made so much progress on self improvement and figuring out what has been wrong in my life. I felt so tired after spending a day typing it out on a document. I wish someone was there to give me a hug. It was hard to process. But my friend who I have been staying with was busy with chatting with someone else. I had no one to talk to. I tried looking for people on the internet to make friends. I am not very enthusiastic about this usually, because I often not feel ready to reach out and make new connections. This time, I wasn’t able to find people to talk to and it didn’t go well because the conversation didn’t last long. I ended up going to omegle and somehow got jnto sexual topic with this guy. We exchanged nudes. It was nice to finally vibe with someone but not in this way. Makes me sad because that wasn’t what I was after. I was just lonely, specifically today. I felt vulnerable, but had the willpower to reach out only to set up a trap for myself to fall into. I am not going to shame myself too much because I want to stay positive to my sexuality. But it feels so meaningless to me to share intimacy with strangers over the internet. People you have no intention to meet. I want to spend time with people in real life and have meaningful connections. Not necessarily sexual. But for my sexual connections, I want them to be meaningful as well. I recognize what I just did was of self-destructive character. Keeping this going isn’t sustainable for me. Which is funny because what I learned from writing all those stuff to myself earlier in the day, was I wanted to stick to a sustainable way of living. A sustainable lifestyle. To not engage in self-destructive behavior. To recognize what is bad and refrain myself from doing those things. To not get involved with people who are toxic. Because I truly believe that is going to make me change into the better version of myself. I made a wrong step and I will never look back. I believe in improvement for myself from tomorrow onwards. I have to make this change for myself. There is no going back now. I know what I want and I want to stay true to myself. It will be tough because loneliness can hit me any time when I’m on my own journey by myself. I wish I something to soothe the painful symptoms of loneliness."

nupipupi,lonely,1620326380.0,A small joy,"I've been lonely for as long as I can remember, no one has ever been on my side. Not my family, not my friends, and never a partner.


I found someone 2 months ago, on Tinder, no less. It was a mistake, we shouldn't have matched. He wasn't even in my city, he'd moved out a week prior. Some sort of app glitch had caused his profile to come through to me. He was cute, he looked sober. Nothing fancy, there wasn't anything that drew me to him in particular. He had this photo in one of the slides of this fat man holding a huge container of something red. He looked familiar, someone I'd seen on tv? Either way, I swiped right to ask him who that character with the funny face holding a large container of red paste(?) was.


We matched, and when I asked him, he told me that was a guy from The Office, and instant dread passed through my mind. I judge people who like The Office and talk about it like a personality trait. We shouldn't have matched. I'd have never swiped right on him had I know it was a The Office reference. He said the guy in the shot spills tomato soup he worked really hard for and he could just relate to that. A little bit of small talk, and we started really bouncing off each other. I LOVED talking to him. We texted for hours, and the next day I didn't know if we were going to talk again. He texted the next night though, and we started scheduling Discord calls where we'd just watch YouTube videos together, and then movies and then listening to songs together.


Well it's been two months since we started talking, and we end every conversation with ""I love you"". If I'm being honest, I don't know how real this is, but having someone to say I love them is a privilege I will never take for granted.

Legataux,lonely,1620084668.0,I am truely alone,"I tried connecting with a couple of people I knew years ago. That spark of connectivity is gone. There was no back and forth. It was just me asking questions and being a little nostalgic. 

I know getting a random message from a person you haven't seen for years doesn't illicit the desire to spill everything, but it would have been nice if they asked me questions. The flow of the conversations were so one sided. If I was on the receiving end I would be thrilled that someone from my life remembered me and wanted to reconnect.

I know online messaging is impersonal, but in the past that's how I communicated with my circle of friends. We game, go online, and say hello to each other. We'd message each other for hours until it was time to sleep and we'd say our goodbyes until next time. I felt that connection then. It's gone now. It hurts knowing that I'm basically a ghost. I'm just a distant memory. I have no friends anymore. I'm empty. 

It's like that feeling of being the only one left. That feeling of watching an empty world. Have you guys seen your friends list on an online game and everyone is offline? 

I play online games because there I forget that I'm alone. I get to say hi to people, even though it's more or less one time interactions. It distracts me from my reality, at least for a little bit. It helps me regain some of that feeling I had, where I was part of a community and I can regularly say hello.

Sometimes I just want to lay on my bed and sleep. I have a loving family, but we aren't friends. There's no dynamic back and forth. I know there's love between them and me, but friends are friends for a reason. My family doesn't socially satisfy me that friends do. I'm so starved for socialization that I remember every bit and piece of it because I seldom get any.

I still cling on to the past because that's all I have left. My memories made me happy, I fear that I won't make new memories with anyone anymore. It will just be me."

About a year ago I had a modest group of friends and a partner. I had recently become pretty sick so I was already stuck at home before quarantine became a thing due to covid. It didn't take too long for me to realize my partner felt more inconvenienced by my sickness than concerned or supportive. Despite knowing this I desperately tried to keep them around because my condition was getting worse and I wanted their support. Eventually they came up with a pretty lame excuse to end things and we went our separate ways. Most of our mutual friends have since stopped talking to me.

I then became completely fixated on my sickness. Constant online research, visits to the doctor, tests, procedures... No diagnosis. After losing \~45 lbs (didn't have a lot of extra weight to lose) and at the absolute end of my rope, a specialist prescribed a medication on a whim, a total guess. It helped for a while, to the point where I thought I had won my health back, but then I became really sick again. I've since gone through 2 more rounds of the medication, with a month or two of feeling healthy in between.

I was feeling REALLY good for a couple months. I had started exercising and working out, even gained back some weight. Then, even though I've been SUPER careful, I got covid. I had some of the typical symptoms like loss of taste/smell, trouble breathing, chest congestion/pain, etc., but it also seemed to bring back all of my old issues and symptoms all at once. This particular ordeal lasted for around 3 weeks, and my ""old"" symptoms thankfully started to fade just as the covid symptoms did. A miserable experience for sure, but I'm thankful it only lasted as long as it did.

Now I'm ""better"" again, though my symptoms aren't totally absent. I've since been able to start running and working out again and it feels good to see the progress I'm making. But now that I've spent so much time literally fighting for my life and putting so much time and effort into my personal health I've found myself totally isolated. I work from home, I exercise at home, I cook and eat my meals at home. It's like now that I have some room to breathe, some time to spend doing anything other than focusing on my health, I'm able to take a look around for the first time in a year and I don't see any of my friends. I've reached out to some of them, but for the most part it seems like the connection is dead.

In a weird, messed up way I kind of miss being sick (yes, I am in therapy lol). It gave me something to focus my whole self on, a purpose. Now that I can get back to other aspects of my life I'm kind of reeling at the amount of loss, and how lonely, I feel."

Breathe in the air of the dead night and go to the river nearby my home and take the loneliest walk ever, just on my own, just me and the night while I stroll around the empty roads while listening to music without a care to give to the world. Forgetting about the pain of living just for a little while at least.
Even surrounded by people I feel lonely so just for one night I want to fully give in to my loneliness. 

Unfortunately I'm stuck here, wearing clothes I don't want to, sleeping and waking up when I don't want to. Can't wait to get the hell out of here and go on that walk :) 20 more days to go."

beebop1632,lonely,1620240437.0,I feel truly alone.. forever alone,"Growing up I was never able to make friends that stuck. Every year of schooling I was hanging out with different friends. Due to conflicts or fall outs my friend group would change each year. This has been literally every year of my life. I am now 24 I have no close friends and no close family. Every day I think about how I don’t feel cared for and how I truly am not needed any where. It makes me very sad that I still don’t have successful connects with others. I feel like an alien, like something is wrong with me, like everyone knows something I don’t to have good healthy relationships. I feel like my life has no purpose or I am struggling to find it. It’s painful to live this way.

Im not really sure what I’m looking for but maybe just a place to vent. I don’t want to feel like this forever. I am ashamed of my life and can’t believe it has come to this."

I know it's Covid but this has been happening for years. I don't have anyone that I can just call and talk to. I look back on my life so far and I don't know how I ended up being so alone. I don't know if my depression was the result or the cause. I never thought I'd be on Reddit saying they I'm do alone but I'm just so sad. I'm 31 and never even been on a date. I don't think a guy's even been remotely interested in me. So romantically, I feel like crap. This past weekend, one of my old classmates posted a picture of a wedding she went to. A few other classmates were there- they kept in touch all these years. I've been invited to 2 weddings that was meant for me and not a family friend. So of course they're married and I'm here crying in my bed as a full grown adult. Why would anyone want to be around this when they have a whole new life.

I usually spend weeks without any human contact. no family or friends.

I disabled all of my social media accounts ... I was sick of watching other ppl pics and stories. I tried dating apps for a while ... no matches.

I spend the weekends laying in bed wondering how can I save myself from this loneliness. how can I make ppl like me. most of the time I come to the conclusion that I have to become rich somehow ... that's the only thing I can control.

I know I'm not attractive or funny, I get it ... I probably wouldn't date myself too. 

I spend too much time imagining myself with some friends or a girlfriends ... laughing at silly jokes and having fun or even fighting ... and then I wake up from my daydream feeling like a loser.

I'm wasting my best years.

thank you for reading."
RosellaSwan9,lonely,1620586757.0,I'm tired of living,It's really hard to go on living each day as though everything is fine and I'm not dying inside. Parents think it's just a phase or that I have anger issues cause I'm doing bad things or feel guilty. It's b***s***. I can't even tell them cause they'll be like you'll get through it. It's just the way of life or you're fine or don't be dramatic. I absolutely hate it. I'm a real person and I have feelings too. Why don't you get that? Its really hard to pretend to be happy cause if I'm not I'm accused of ruining everyone else's mood or trying to get my way by ruining the day. And then when I'm asked if I have friends or can't say no I don't so I just nod my head but actually whenever I try to make friends it just doesn't work. If someone asks me to come walk with them or play badminton I happily get up and go but on the way they ditch me and I wait for minutes to see if they come back but they don't. No one ever does. And then they have the audacity to actually ask me why are you sitting alone? Why are you so quiet? And when I talk the again they have something to complain about like why are you so hyper? Can you shut up I'm trying to talk? And I hate that. I feel like there's something wrong with me that's why I don't fit in. I just want someone who likes me for who I am and doesn't try to change me and actually gets me. Life is s***. Won't complain if it's over.

Pretty-big-mess-rn,lonely,1620279284.0,I am so fucking tired of meeting someone just to ghost them after the investment,"Like literally what's the point of making connections and meeting people these days just to ghost each other? That's basically every dating app and every relationship. People date for years and then break up and all that time and invested put into someone becomes fucking worthless.

I'm so sick of it I'm so sick of it I'm so sick of it. Like at this point fuck almost everyone I've talked to this past few months. Please fucking burn in hell. All I see is me reaching out to people and no one reaching back out. Or better yet people reaching out to me, being so into me, and then something happens and bang is like we never talked in the first place. No one gives a fuck it's all ghosting. At this point please aliens over lord whipe the fucking planet.

It has to be a guy thing, no? An average looking girl on tinder gets 100000 matches with minimal effort. Yeah you have to sort through all the shit dudes but at least you will have people making an effort for you. Is so unfair how some of us are just meant to be lonelier than others."
WellsyFinn,lonely,1620600574.0,Does anyone else feel completely lost in their 20s?,"I was told these were supposed to be the best years of my life, but instead I’m stuck in a job which I have no passion for, have no girlfriend, no friends and I feel like I’m being left behind by all the people I grew up with.   


I have pretty bad social anxiety and it’s caused me to push a lot of people away in the past and I can never maintain any relationships. This has led me to crippling loneliness. But it’s so hard when the thing I crave most (a social life) is also the thing that causes me the most anxiety.

So I figured I’d try and make a few internet friends first. I turn 27 next month, from the UK and I’m into Sports, gaming and anything to do with Geography or travelling. Send me a message if you’re Interested in making an internet friend yourself :)"

slong35,lonely,1620142773.0,Wanted to get this off my chest.,"Sorry for a long post but I need to get some things off my chest so I figured that sending it out there might do some good. I already posted this on the therapy subreddit but literally nobody saw it. I don’t want a pity party or lots of attention but I at least wanted to share a few things with people and see what they think. 

I’m 26 and have been diagnosed with chemical depression but I’m pretty convinced I also have some anxiety issues as well (based on a few other family members that obviously struggle with it but are too proud to go see a doctor for it.) I take medication but it doesn’t really help all that much. I regularly exercise and have taken therapy before but neither one has been any sort of relief toward the issue.

So I’ll list a few of the problems that I’ve been dealing with (even though there’s much more to them than what I’ll put in here.) I’ve wanted my life to be much more of an adventure but I feel held back from the things I want to accomplish. Not just from my family but also by myself. I don’t have much respect for who I am, what I look like, how shy I tend to be, and all the things I’ve spent years on to try and build in my life (music, drawing, learning languages, etc.) I’ve always wanted to live and work in Japan. I went there for a study abroad program back in 2017 and I fell in love with the people, culture, and rich history there. I also felt strangely at home because many of the world views and mannerisms I experienced over there were very similar to how I feel and look at the world. Anyway, I want to go there and start with a teaching job but I don’t feel worth the trouble. It’s either I go there and leave my family, or stay here and be miserable. Kind of a “lose-lose” scenario from how it feels.

I’ve never been good with dating but I crave the feeling of being loved by someone. I also want to be a dad more than anything in the world because I feel like there’s so much love that I have to give. It’s just excruciating to have that kind of a desire but never being able to achieve that. The only relationship I’ve ever been in finally had me thinking I was getting close but I couldn’t help but think that she was only with me because she couldn’t find anyone else that would marry her and I was simply her version of ‘settling’. I really feel like I did love her but I had never actually been in a real relationship so I didn’t know what to do. Long story short I ended up breaking things off with her. I still think about her a lot but she’s married and has a kid already so I feel like I missed out on a real shot at happiness.

There’s much more than these two examples but the gist is that I feel like human garbage and not worth anyone’s time. This stuff has been on my mind a lot (especially in the last few days) and I wanted to put this out there and see what people might think (from an outside perspective I suppose.)"
MoneyHot993,lonely,1619887068.0,Is anyone else here an alcoholic?,"I was almost always pretty much friendless. Also, alcoholism runs in parts of my family. I already had issues with drinking in my teen years, but in my early twenties it got really bad. I was in college and slowly realized that I hated my major and that I was still extremely alone despite having some dumb wishes about college being fun and finally making me a more social person. It's very stupid, but I hoped I'd finally become a ""late bloomer"" of sorts. Well, I didn't. I decided to drop out, but at the time my drinking was already nearly daily and only getting worse. 

Since then my drinking has lead to arrests, stays in the hospital/mental ward, one rehab and various other bullshit. A lot of seems so bad that it should scare me away from drinking, but honestly, whenever it gets late and I look around in my silent, empty apartment I just can't resist the urge to drink. I feel I can't cope with being alone without drinking. I tried approaching people before, but the friendships I have with them are always extremely one sided and they never talk to me on their own. I get that that's on me, because they think I'm boring and forgettable, but I can't help it, and the more this goes on the more I just can't bring myself to bother trying yet again."
melonbanger1,lonely,1620383532.0,Being a guy is heartcrushingly lonely,"Its hard to even put the loneliness i feel into words. I just...exist. I notice regularly that i go days without speaking.

The only family i had was my mom and she passed, that same week my girlfriend who was my absolute biggest support system left me and that threw me into a pit that i still dont think ive crawled out of. Every couple months i go through the same process of downloading tinder or something of the sorts, get no matches, delete and repeat. Over the years my friends dwindled and the last few remaining friendships i had didnt survive through covid. So now here i am. I live in my car feeling the deepest loneliness i couldnt even dream of as a child almost daily. Why am i posting this? I just want to feel like im talking to someone for once.

chiyxki,lonely,1620233800.0,"it's lonely,","I can't sleep. Last night I cried my eyes out until sunrise. Whenever I talk, call or hang out with the few friends I have, half of them just want to make me go home and end it. Whenever I come home there's no one I can go to to ask for help or comfort. I really wish I could cry my eyes out in someone's arms, all night long. And no matter how much nights I cry they'll still hold me. That's how it'd feel to not be lonely, being able to cry your eyes out while being held by someone who cares. Finding peace in solitude doesn't work, I need people in my life. There's so much to vent about and in the end I always come to the conclusion that ending it would be the easiest option to escape all these feelings."

Boswellboxer,lonely,1620509434.0,on my own after big mistakes,"Last year I did the decision of going to university while staying at home, this was a decision I just didn't really think that much about at the time. 

As I start going to my uni lectures I realise its so much harder to meet people since I'm not having the situations of staying in an accommodation and living with new people. When I meet course mates we can't really do anything after uni sessions when it takes me such a long time to get home, with staying at home came me needing to get a 40 minute train and for me to drive from the station to the little village I live in, so any sense of drinking alcohol can't happen (not that I enjoy alcohol, it makes my anxiety so bad)

I regret so much not living in the city where my university is located, I can't do societies, I just feel like I'm not growing.

Recently I had to quit this job I had just got at a petrol station due to my mental health , it made me feel so much more lonier since I now don't get any real interaction with people outside of my house. I don't really have friends and I just live with my mum.

tldr:
im 21 completely alone feeling like a failure while doing university at home, I don't have any mates and I'm getting a sense of craziness.

madmaxvhd1,lonely,1620015007.0,It is one of those nights.,"Yeah- One of those nights. I suppose I'm referring to nights that have some kind of feeling about them- It's hard to explain. I would describe this feeling as a combination of awe, melancholy, calmness and peacefulness. I'm not the best at describing it- but I believe you already understand what I mean. This feeling is only peculiar to these nights and I guess I wanted to talk about it.

I feel lonely all the time- On these nights though, I either notice it less or it simply doesn't bother me. These are perhaps my favorite times of life, the peacefulness I feel is something I wish was with me all the time.

Sometimes, I wish I could just observe the world. I don't want to have to worry about life. I just want to see the trees blowing in the wind and the sun setting. Why can't everything just be peaceful? ""I can't wait to grow up"" I used to tell myself.. ""I want to be young again"" I now tell myself.. Oh how things change.. I guess everything changes.

Do you ever just reach a point in your sadness, where you feel at peace? like nothing can hurt you more than you’ve already felt, it can’t get worse, so it has to get better, right? I'm just so tried of being alone.

Yeah. I just wanted to say that I guess- No real point behind this post I suppose, It's just one of those nights."

happyaquarius,lonely,1620463003.0,Extreme Loneliness,"Hi everyone! Isn’t it crazy how loneliness is a disadvantage? Good social skills don’t come from being by yourself all the time. Since I was a kid I’ve been very isolated so I was learning social skills a little late and I still am so bad at it, I cringe at myself all the time...I don’t have any family or friends and it’s just me taking care of my two girls. I go to work but really the interaction is not much connection and sometimes people want to talk to me more intimately but I’m only looking for friends so I shut them out. I also struggle making connections because I struggle with well, loneliness and anxiety. The loneliness causes me to talk too much and anxiety makes me wish I’d just shut up. I love my girls but I wish I had someone to have more adult conversations with. Also it really puts me down that I’m raising two girls who have a mom like me. If any moms see this and can relate I love and appreciate you and I send you an abundance of energy. On the bright side my girls are literally keeping me sane. 
I will say whatever you’re interested in I encourage you to find ways to integrate yourself into your hobbies. Ex. I like anything spiritual so I try to find healing centers, groups, yogi’s anything to try to get involved. I haven’t gone to any yet but I plan to. I also read books and lay in the sun.

I met this girl here, she’s amazing, I planned to be with her, and she agreed, until I got told I was deploying and switching bases again...I told her today and she’s heart broken, almost as if she’s changed her mind, which is understandable, I just wish I had someone, someone whose gonna ride it out with me till the wheels fall off, someone who’s not gonna switch up on me and make this shitty life a little less shitty, maybe that’s too much to ask for"

So recently my room just got pimped the fuck out of. I now have a TV, a PS4 (I got this PS4 on launch and the PS5 on launch. The PS5 is on the big screen downstairs and I got the PS4 so that’s pretty cool) a speaker, a keyboard and LED Lights, a really comfy big red chair and a keyboard stool. I now can say I have the best room. It may be the smallest but size doesn’t matter, it’s the motion of the commotion 😂😂 but jokes aside with all these things I still don’t feel any better, there’s not a simple thing on this planet that’ll make me feel happier except from her. I still want her back, I am still really down and I have been for what feels like decades. A few hours ago I had an attempt. But you know what stopped me? My dog walked in because she was hungry and I shit you not, i was so close. My parents thankfully (for them, I’d be much happier dead right now) don’t know and if my dog hadn’t walked in maybe I might be dead right now. I don’t know what to do with this miserable life anymore, all my friends and family think I’m so happy when really I’m suicidal.

_JosephiKrakowski,lonely,1620338800.0,Nothing is more isolating than seeing other people's happiness.,"Ok so before anyone jumps to conclusions, lemme explain myself.

What I mean is that I see on a daily basis other people (friends mainly) being in relationships or holding hands with people or anything like that. As someone who has never been in a relationship, this hurts. Now obviously I'm happy for them because of course I am but it's still a thought I can't ignore.

I'm rarely truly happy these days. I beat myself down and convince myself I'm no good. I don't feel like I have any skills or talents. I can make people laugh easily but I don't think I'm funny. I'm not smart. Hell, I'm not even attractive in any way. And seeing other people in the complete opposite position to me makes me feel like a spectator to all the good things in their life while having none of my own.

I'm lonely. I have loads of friends but I still feel isolated. Who even am I? I used to talk to people regularly but now I take much longer to text back. I don't know what's wrong with me.

I've gotten a bit off-topic, the gist of this is that everyone else can hitch up but I can't. Even one of my friends who pretty much everyone (especially girls) finds annoying and yet he's got a girlfriend. Why am I so repulsive? Why can't I get it right? Am I really just that worthless?

crinders,lonely,1620583259.0,Getting over losing all of my friends,"
It's been over 4 years now since I've lost my friend group that I've been so close with ( we hung out every day and done everything together). It's still very painful and I'm still scared and get anxiety to face them. 

We were right before graduating when shit hit the fan. My best friend was in love with this girl and so was I but I actually had no idea. Long story short he got messed up in the head cuz of this girl who was also part of our group and clearly who he was madly in love with. They got together one or two times and she took his virginity. However she ended it but she remained in the friend group. 

One day when I was wasted I've got with her. The next day I felt so bad about it since my best friend was madly in love with her. However it was sooo good, probably even better since it was forbidden. We kept getting together behind everyone's back for a couple of months. Until one day when we were drunk he found out. I apologised but he wouldn't listen, I even told him to punch me but he wouldn't. I was so sad, upset and ashamed that I've done it and could barely live with my self. 

In the next 2 weeks I still kept seeing her and he knew about it. Then one night he wanted to meet up to talk so we did. However he just beat the living crap out of me. He left and my mom found me almost unconscious. She brought me to the hospital, but I was fine just a few bumps and scratches nothing serious. 

In my opinion the whole thing was fine now, I got with the girl he loved and therefore he beat me up. I would have done the same if I was in his position. I kept seeing her because at it turned out I loved her as well and finally I was happy! Most of my friends stopped talking to me however  some still talked to me and understood. 

3 days later I came back home to find my mom, sisters and dad waiting for me. They sat me down and tried talking me into going to the police to report him. I stood my ground and told them no way in hell I will do that as I knew how bad things are gonna turn. However they kept trying and trying until finally I gave in. I then went on to report him for which I to this day hate myself for. Since I don't believe what he's done was wrong and also having to report my best friend is just horrible. 

Obviously it completely backfired and all of my mates turned on me, I mean who wouldn't. I even had more of my mates threaten me to beat me up as well for going to the cops. As I live in a small town this story spread rapidly and I was even more ashamed. I developed anxiety for doing the simplest things such as going to the gym, grocery store, gas station, even getting pizza delivered cuz that person might know and spit in my pizza. (Thats messed up ain't it?)

 I've started travelling and moved away but to this day when I'm back visiting my family I still can't go fill up my gas without feeling anxiety and fear. I can't evengo grocery shopping without being scared. Usually I avoid any places where I could possibly meet my old mates or class mates or even anyone who's in my age group. It's a horrible feeling and it destroys me. I need to get rid of that anxiety and fear but I don't know how. 

By now I hate my family for basically forcing me to report this to the police. If they hadn't done that my life would be a lot nicer now. They forced me and then left me to deal with it. I can't understand how that is fair. Any time I try to talk to my mom about it she jtst says: ""you have to report this because it's wrong. If you like it or not"". She just doesn't understand what impact this had on me and my life. And how much anxiety and fear this has given me. Even while I seemed happy for being with my girl I was still deeply depressed inside. Losing my best friend has been the hardest thing in my life.

To this day I've never spoken to my former best friend and anyone else out of this friend group. Its still very hard for me to make new friends and even be happy. I also keep thinking back to this time in my life and still feel the shame, anxiety and fear. 

I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read my story. 
Have a good day. All the love and all the power!"

ri7su7ka,lonely,1620627284.0,Writing personal essay for last assignment makes me want to rip out my fucking hair,"I'm a senior in high school, about to graduate (hopefully, I'm about on the edge of failing my necessary class right now..) but holy shit the last roadblock is an essay about my experiences and 'Ten Things I know to be true.' Everything I think of for this is all trauma, the isolation, depression, ideation, just.... a lot of negative things 'I know.' I read the examples and it's just about funny things, encouraging words, actual life experiences... being alive. I dont know those things at all... I am already horrendous at my work (honestly lazy... didn't think I would make this far and... honestly don't care if I do graduate, i never did.) But having to make it personal is just even more shit. The last personal essay I had to write in this fucking class was about me trying to so neatly and clinically compare how my own mom's death felt compared to the book we were reading and I almost failed that too, really because it was late but....I just feel so weak. I wish i could write an essay full of young joy, of hope, of feeling so normal and not wanting to cry, and feel hurt but also yearn for people and just feel alright. These never make me feel alright or normal, especially already as the poor, weird, lgbt, loner kid in this shithole district. 

All I know is I shouldn't write things that end me in psych, but staring at this blank document and letting the corners of my skull tingle with the things i actually know to be true, loneliness, mental illness, pain, bullying, it just... is what i know. What else do I know"

LL_Pegasi,lonely,1620131997.0,Missing my parents immensely,"Oftentimes I cry because I miss them so badly. Growing up, they are both far away to work abroad and in a few months I'm turning 18. They are rarely here to visit and stay either for a month/ a year and over the times our relationship has gotten awkward especially with my dad, but with mom it's just alright.

But we talk on the internet, not just often. My grandma and uncle are here to supervise us but we've had history of rocky patches - we used to be so close but not anymore. Barely spoke here in the household for years. 

And so everyday the loneliness and the longing caves in so much that I find solace in things that aren't supposed to be helpful to me. Seeing other children close to their parents, being hugged, comforted or even just having fun with them makes me envious and make my heart churn.

It's pathetic to feel this way, knowing I should be thankful instead for parents that strive hard for my education. So hiding it is the best way. I just open up here. 


I miss them so much and it stings. There's alot that money can buy like mainstream objects : fashion clothes, gadgets, iPhones, makeup.. but one can never buy affection and safety."
Void_Skeleton,lonely,1620439615.0,Just another day of Loneliness (Rant/Vent),"(I apologize for any spelling mistakes, English ain't my first language)  
Here I am again, with the same ol' day everyday, having no one to talk to, having no one in my life, not fitting with anyone, let me tell ya, it's quite bullshit when you want to just hangout with someone and realize you have NO ONE in your whole life, it's especially bad when you grow up with autism meaning I already developed anxiety and depression and even worse communication skills which was never treated, let me tell ya, the combination is quite bad when you slap in 'loneliness' into the mix, nowadays I feel almost nothing, I honestly think I am destined to be alone because no matter how hard I try or tried to make friends, I really don't care for relationships even if I never had it in my life, I just want SOMEONE to hangout that I could call them my 'bestfriend' who you could 100% relate to and talk with almost everyday or a group of friends that have the same dedication or interests as me, but I'm just ignored or hated on or just shit talked on for just saying at least one sentence when I try to fit in or chat, it's just asinine that the Universe just puts a 'Lonely no matter what' tag on my life, nowadays all I do is wake up, go to my PC, sit all day in front of it and then go sleep, I mean, I play video games and draw sometimes but it gets real sad when I play a game which I had fun or was interested in and I would have no one to talk to about it, or when I draw I just don't get enough inspiration and only friends (if I had any) would fuel me inspiration.  
I always imagined myself having a bestfriend or being in a group when I watch those Youtube videos, ya know those Youtube videos when you see partners or group of buddies having a lot of fun no matter what the activity is, be it games or just generally hanging out, then realized I have no one, now knowing the fact I'm already a young adult (I'm 21 now) makes me think that I'll never be able to get anyone in my life.

My life has been so uneventful for so long that I don't think I'll be ever be interesting to anyone, I'm just a walking husk and nowadays I'm an asshole to people for no reason, it's hard to be at least bit nice to anyone when I was treated shit all my life just because I was ""DIFFERENT"", autism be damned man.

I don't know if I should call it the worst or the best thing in my life but when I dream I sometimes dream of having people in my life, be it friends or a relationship and the feeling was great and amazing but when I wake up I have a moment of wanting to talk about it to my friends... Oh yeah, I don't have any... That's the worst part. So yeah, I still don't know if that's the best or the worst thing.

Actually, I think the worst part is when you psych up yourself for no reason at all, I just sometimes get that feeling, it's quite annoying when I know there's just nothing to be psyched up for.

I forgot to also mention that I am invisible as fuck, like, I accidentally scare people sometimes, I'm apparently that quiet and invisible, of course you may be thinking that's probably useful in a way, I agree with that but it's very painful at the same time, it's like one of those moments when you try to fit in a conversation in the past in school but you get unnoticed or cut off by everyone else and you just stand there not acknowledged in any way, as I said, invisible as fuck.

So yeah, at the time I finish typing it will probably going to be 5 AM, yeah, I've been awake that long but I'll be going to sleep after I post this, I really don't have a reason to sleep since there's nothing for me to look up to when I wake up.

Thank you if you reached this point of reading this shitty rant or vent or whatever the Hell. By the time I post this I'll be most likely asleep, asleep for a long time despite having a hard time doing that, have a nice morning/day/evening/night."
Confused_42,lonely,1620248024.0,Wasted Platonic Energy,"
Hello everyone I hope you are having at least an ok day. I have massive amounts of platonic energy that has nowhere to go and I am constantly freaking out. All I want is to hug and embrace someone with them saying it will all be ok, and I would do the same back to them. I want to have that feeling that someone actually cares and you care back. None of these thoughts are sexual in nature and are purely focusing on just wishing someone was there. I want to cuddle with someone, to talk to them about all my crap and I listen to them talk about theirs. Someone to be there when times are hard for me and someone to be there for when times are hard for them. I feel I can never be loved because of the thing I am and my crippling social anxiety. I am kinda hopeless at this point with thoughts and feelings flying around my head aimlessly, I mean just look at my writing format. I have no life I sit at home and rot, yes I know I should get out and do stuff but my anxiety prevents it most of the time. 

That’s it, if you want to know a bit about me and my circumstances you can keep reading. Other than that thanks for reading my post

I am a senior in high school have very few friends (mostly online) and have never dated, kissed, or been in a relationship. I suffer trauma when I was younger and I have almost no self confidence and I am a VERY in uncompetitive and overall submissive person who is also an introvert. I have thought about and almost tried to end it on more than one occasion. To return to my point I am crippled by the fact I am not a girl and never lived my life that way from the beginning, anyway this is not a trans post sorry.

I have a younger brother who took after my extrovert dad. And he's involved in sports and church groups. When we are at baseball, I just sit in the car watching him play and enjoy his childhood. Yesterday we went to award ceremony for his church kids club that I had previously been in when I was on the medicine, and the leader woman came up to me when I was stuffing my face with a cookie and asked me If im in youth group. I felt like such a looser saying no. Anyways I guess I'll just go on in life without a childhood. I know being an alcoholic is bad but Im seriously considering it when im 21.  Guess I'll just be a reckloose all my life.   Anyway that's my story."

I've been suicidal for a long time. It got worse in last few months. I zone out, see things, cry for hours and self harm. I keep talking to imaginary people in my head, I make jokes and even laugh out loud. I don't have an access to a treatment. I am geniuenly alone and I don't have anyone to talk. My issues are always too much for people (even for kind internet strangers) even though I only share maybe 5% of it at max. I am in an abusive situation rn. I understand this and I am aware that nobody can help. I really don't blame anyone. Even I can't accept my situation fully. I just can't anymore. I need to live for about 7-8 months because of a family occasion. That's all I want. I am so alone and I have no idea how to make it. It is unbearable. I am not afraid of dying.

figutingThingsOut,lonely,1620620586.0,just thinking about how much has changed in the past 4-5 years.,"I was at point A --> (younger, had friends, had fun here and there, etc)


Now I'm at point B --> (alone, lonely, guilty, get anxious/nervous a lot, under a blanket of sadness, scared, trying to keep going)


The only option I have is to move towards point C --> (build something for myself, grow, mature, forgive myself, happiness).


Can't and don't want to go back to A even though it was relatively nicer. 


I wish things were different. But the truth is they're not and I can't change the past. 


What I can do is try to work on my life now so I won't have to hope things were different in the future.


I make a lot of posts/comments like this as a way to remind myself when I start letting my mind slip. I'm trying to control my jealous, sad, angry, toxic, etc thoughts. Trying to be hopeful. 


I'm trying my best :/"
pokemom91,lonely,1620279691.0,It's my birthday but my husband is in the hospital,"Tomorrow is my 30th birthday. 
I'm spending the last night of my 20s really alone. My husband is in the hospital fighting an infection. I am glad he is getting better and will be coming home soon. We are actually really relieved because he has a diagnosis and answers and it's all going to be okay. 

Last year, my family forgot my birthday and also mothers day which comes a few days later. It was a really hurtful disappointment. I always had this idea that if my birthday were ever glazed over by my mate, I would consider that to be the end of it. 

I have spent most of this year with that disappointment in the back of my mind.  It bothers me and it was never really addressed or resolved, because It makes me feel greedy and undeserving or entitled and obnoxious. But my heart is broken over it.

But now the poor guy is in the hospital- who cares about a dumb birthday when your husband is in the hospital?  My daughter is crying. My toddler is confused. My oldest is moody. Celebrating isn't really on my mind. I'm worried. I miss him. 

My father died on my birthday 20 years ago this year as well so it's just all super uncomfortable and I can't help but feel sad right now. I don't have any friends. 

I am just going to have to make cupcakes with the kids and pretend like I am happy."
Neo-Neon,lonely,1620290194.0,Idk how to make friends,I’m 18 not in school and I am currently out of work and I struggle to make friends. Any friends I used to have don’t wanna talk to me I assume because how socially awkward I am I never know how to make a conversation.. but I also struggle making new friends. I’m having the same problem of talking to people and finding a connection. People lose interest in me fast and it’s a struggle being alone so much. I have one friend on discord but she is usually busy with school and can’t talk. I joined many discord servers trying to find friends but I never seem to fit in. I just wish I knew how to be interesting and make people wanna talk to me without feeling like I have to fake a personality. I especially find it hard to talk to other females they are usually judgmental or bitchy. I used to have a lot of guy friends but since I got married I had to cut them off since my husband doesn’t want me around other boys (even though I couldn’t ever imagine cheating which I never have done before either). It’s just a struggle having no one to talk to it gets lonely.

aconitumvulparia,lonely,1620412818.0,So Done Feeling Lonely In My Own Family,"This situation literally just happened five minutes ago.

I was in a parking lot a few miles from where I live where there's many shops, heavy traffic, and lots of people around. I needed to make a phone call and rather doing that while I was driving, I figured I'd stop to make the call and then resume my drive home. Well, as I'm pulling out a heavily beat-up pickup truck pulls up with two men inside. They roll their windows down and proceed to try to coax me to roll my window down too. At this point I'm scared and I keep pulling out and screaming ""NO"", because they started to get out of their truck. I sped away and called my mom so someone would be on the phone with me until I got home. I told her what happened and that I was taking a different route to the house (we have about 4 different entrances to our neighborhood) and that I would be there soon. She proceeds to make fun of me saying ""Hannah, your dad is here you could've come straight home, just stop what you're doing you always over think stuff like this, it's a little ridiculous"". I then get home and my dad comes out waving his arms laughing, ""Where they at? Where they at? They're gonna get ya!"" I told him flatly, ""It's not funny, I was scared"". He responds with, ""It's hilarious."" And I stand up for myself saying, ""Yeah it's so hilarious they caught me off guard and scared me. So funny."" He then proceeds to go inside, slamming the door behind him. I follow, calling him out on his behavior and he says, ""I don't even recall saying it's hilarious."" WHEN HE JUST DID. I called my mom out on what she said too and she says what she always does, ""You look too much into things. Stop taking things so seriously."" They don't even try to be sympathetic, they just tear me down whatever chance they get and when I defend myself or call them out they respond with ""It's so sad you can't take a joke"". Like my mom will call me out for eating something and it going straight to my hips (I'm only 121 lbs) and my dad follows up with ""can't forget her face either, that's going to get fat too"". I feel so alone here. I'm moving to the UK in September for grad school, but I feel like I mentally/emotionally won't make it until then. I'm always made fun of and when I admonish the bad behavior they act like children. Even when I ignore it, they call me names and find new ways of ""joking"".

I know there's things I have to be grateful for, like free meals, a roof over my head, etc... I just don't feel like those things qualify someone to degrade me whenever they want. I'm just so done and so sick of it. The rest of my family is the same way too. I just don't understand why it's so hard for them to just be kind and considerate. I feel extremely isolated, lonely, and sad. I don't have the freedom to be myself here, so I'm always on my guard. I'm feeling like the life is being sucked out of me."

The_tormented_artist,lonely,1620145494.0,Vent,"Small vent, I just need to let it out somewhere.  


I feel so lonely( this must be the right sub for me). I don't really have anyone to go outside with or be fully open about my feelings. I'm comfortable enough to go by myself to the park, coffee shop or similar places to hang out and I'm not having a bad time, but... these past weeks I feel so unmotivated to do that because I have no one to meet anyway. I'm also not a fan of big groups as they bore me honestly, and prefer hanging out with 1-2 people at a time and so far I didn't find anyone in the same boat as me. I tried Tinder, but the connection just isn't there. I also went to an improv class for at least one year, went out with the people there, and I made a pretty good friend, but after a while I noticed I was putting more effort, stopped texting first...and eventually the friendship faded.

&#x200B;

It's hard to talk to others about your own loneliness because those who don't experience it so much think there must be a bad reason to why you don't have friends. I'm not the best, but I'm not a bad person either. I'm not any -phobic word, I always try to emotionally support my friends when they need to, I am a loyal friend and I have a whole universe I want to share. I don't look physically intimidating and I'm not some creep you'd wanna avoid at the gas station. It's just hard to find a meaningful connection since even as a kid I didn't have friends.

&#x200B;

I get little to no physical affection and I wish I could find someone to be with. I tried to open up about my loneliness to some friends I have, but they weren't so understanding and I can't blame them. I can't help but wonder what went wrong. Why do I have to be so introverted? Why can't I also be the type that makes friends easily? I just want one best friend, is that too much to ask for?

&#x200B;

Well, this has been a bit more than a small rant."

MissyMensa,lonely,1620063154.0,I think I’m meant to be alone,"I’ll start this by saying I’m a lucky person because I’ve never struggled with friendships or anything like that but love is a different story. 

I grew up a fat, tall black girl in a majority white school and area. I’ve always wanted reciprocated love. I’m a loving person and have always felt I want to love and be loved. For 23 years I never had reciprocated love or affection. 

Anyone I liked didn’t like me back and vice versa. I had my first kiss because someone initiated it for me at 17 and the next week at school the boy denied it even happened. He was obviously ashamed to have kissed me. 

I lost 40kgs lately and have been getting more make attention but not from anyone I actually like. I still don’t have the ideal body despite the weight loss. I still have a tummy that spills over and breast that look like they’ve taken a beating.
I don’t think I’m ugly but my love life being nonexistent makes me think there’s just something about me that’s unattractive and unlovable. 

Last year for the first time I had a reciprocated ‘relationship’. We had a great connection at first. Obviously since it was my first experience with any kind of love and affection I struggled to contain my emotions. I caught feelings, he didn’t (I’m assuming). Slowly but surely he started losing interest and I got less and less of his time, attention and affection. He keeps in contact (if you can even call it that) but I think it’s just because he wants to still have access to me. 

I miss him so much and I’m convinced I won’t find anyone to have a connection like this again. I feel so stupid for falling for him and thinking he would fall for me too. 

I so wish I didn’t crave romantic love and affection because I think I’m supposed to do life without love. I’ve been so lonely for so long and I don’t know how to get used to it. I don’t know how to accept that I might die never knowing what it’s like to love and be loved in return."

I hope all of you find that, but I think a lot of know that it is either unlikely or a long ways away. I believe I will likely be alone for most of my life mostly because of mental illnesses and the issues that causes with my social connections. I am trying to come to terms with it, part of me wants to fight it and try to make the connections I need, but the other part of me says that letting go will be easier. Some of you may be in a similar boat, and I hope the best for you, no one deserves to suffer in loneliness we are all social creatures.

I see them hang out together on social media but i never hear from them. On the hunt for new friends, I downloaded apps like tinder and Yubo, but everyone I tried reaching out to give a tenth of the effort of trying to become friends with me compared to what i gave them. I've always had trouble with friends, until my senior year of high school, every group I was in resulted in me getting bullied. I knew people always liked to bully the ugly kid so I started to improve myself, joined the gym, started taking proper care of my skin and hair, started dressing nicer. I've made significant progress but it didn't really help(honestly this part is really superficial I didn't expect this to be ""the solution""). I feel worse everyday, I don't think I'm a dickhead, I love being nice to people and caring for them. I think there's just something fundamentally wrong with me and it makes me not want to exist. I mostly love myself, but I'm really young and i just want people to enjoy the best years of my life with, which are yet to come.

After Christmas, I think the loneliest time of the year for me is my birthday. I just really dread it coming around, because even when it feels like I don't care. I still end up in such a sad mood & to top it all off for some reason something always goes badly during it. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is I expected to get a few happy birthdays from some people who I thought were my friend's yesterday, but yesterday ended an hour and a half ago. I've really valued my friendship especially with one person in particular & not even getting a ""happy bday"" message from them stings. 

Admittedly I did cry yesterday morning & tried to sleep my way through the day. I feel better now but I know that's partially because my birthday is over. 

It's embarrassing to say since I was a kid I've only ever wanted a stable home life & friends. Neither of which I have today at a big 22 years old.

A friend committed suicide. My best friend has 3 kids and is married to man she doesn’t even trust to leave for one night to watch their kids. My other friend never answers my calls and has only occasionally invited me be a third wheel. I’m a good person and I don’t know where to even make a connection anymore. I know that I can’t keep being the only one to ever make the effort. I work a full time job and deal with majorly difficult and hateful people who take their anger out on me. Some days I just want to cry. I just want good friends and it’s awful that I have ended up so secluded and exhausted from pouring so much of my heart into people that don’t even seem to care. And to top that off my ex from years ago fucked with my emotions and I allowed him to string me on for 6 years. Told me he wanted to marry me and have a family. He then left to live a van life. Not once did he show up or respect what I was so upfront with needing and asking for communication. I know that’s a lot. Obviously I haven’t gone into ALL the details but I’m trying.  I guess I posted this cause I wanted to at least feel like even for a moment that I am heard by someone. Felt like I needed to add my biggest emotional upsets that I’m sad that since I’m 33 and alone that I will never find love and that I will never experience being a mom. I hate feeling like I’ve convinced myself that I’ll never be loved. Plus I know I need counseling but I’ve been wanting to sit with an actual therapist but I don’t believe my state is even allowing that right now. I just want to be okay.

Marco2213,lonely,1619934508.0,I'm desperate im deprived of my freedom,"I'm a 19M guy that never go out of home. I'm kind of  deprived of going outside of my home, i live in my parents house and they never let me go outside for no reason. 

I've been like this all my life, but it's affecting me now cause I'm losing my friends, losing my mental health and feeling lonely. 

I already talked about it with them many times, but it's a decision my mother took, cause she was educated like this and doesn't know other thing. Definitely I can't convince her or them and I need to adapt myself to the rules

I can do it if I propose to, I can be hanging out with friends or going to wherever I'd want, but i don't want to have problems. They can kick me out of the house and I don't have no money to start living by my own, and it's difficult to start living like this in my country from overnight cause I've never worked before. 

It's even more difficult cause the college take most of my time, like from 9am to 5pm. And if they don't kick me they'll take my few privileges, what would make it worst living here :(( , i think I'm going crazy. I'm only allowed to go out if I get a job, but it's the same case, I'll need to leave the college 


I can't even invite a friend to come or have a pet. Its all so lonely and feels wrong

I'm desperate already. I just wanted to vent. It's hard to believe for me that the person that it supposed to love me the most in the world is doing me this.

I already have social anxiety issues and I don't know how to interact with people, i feel like I'm percibed like a creepy guy and I think my presence makes the people uncomfortable 

I don't know how to do. Sometimes i want to live my house, but then I start thinking about how hard would be and my hopes fall again. Don't misunderstand me, i live comfortably here, but not feel free, i feel trapped. I feel like every person in the world can go around there except me, like I'm incomplete and deprived of the best of my life, i don't know what it is"

New-Witness3885,lonely,1620545621.0,my old life,"TW: may have talk about suicide, and abuse.

i miss my old life really bad, i miss my old friends, my house, basically everything about it. 
i used to live in a capital city. it was very famous and popular, but i didn’t like it, but i miss my life there. basically my whole life i’ve been moving back and forth to specific cities and. it sucks. i lived in the capital for a long time, around 6 years in total (9 if you include the times i stayed there when i was young before being raised for a few years in england and moving back) and some friends, moved to a city and lived in my grandmas for a year, made friends, moved back, stayed for two years, got stuck in my grandmas house for a few months during the beginning of covid. then moved there, this time permanently. got an apartment, lived there for awhile. before getting a house.

i miss my old friends, fro, both schools, the ones from my old school were my best friends, but now im forgotten to them (literally they forgot i existed) , never answer my texts, always are busy when they do, and they changed, not the same people i became friends with. we dont have that same type of vibe, it feels dull and fake when i text them. now 2 of them havent answered my texts in like half a year (will soon be a full year ig)  

from my school that im currently school i despise them, theyre snobby, shit bro i didnt do anything to you? why you suddenly acting like i murdered your mom or stole your fucking phone holy shit.they also forgot about me. i don’t consider them my friends.

i talk to one person every day, probably two or three per month in total, and the two others are only my mom asking me to do a chore, or the delivery guy.

i get so so lonely, i see my friends posting about them hanging out all the time now that they finished school a few days ago. i’m just there watching it.

i’m watching my life go by, not actually living it. 

i can’t talk to my mom or dad about it, they’re abusive. mom doesn’t care about me, broken relationship, and she always looks for reasons to be mad, doesn’t care about my health or my wishes. dad doesn’t even have a relationship with me, also abusive. he just cares about my baby twin siblings and my younger brother. awkward when i’m with him or look at him.


i want to be with my old friends and have my normal happy relationship with them, i miss meeting up at my old school and ditching together or crying together about exams and teachers, making up ghost stores, and when we met up too early we’d get freaked out my the dark halls.sneaking into the kindergartners playgrounds, or getting freaked out at bugs and running away from the janitor. or some dumb stuff, then meeting up at our houses and . now they do that without me. i understand, i’m unattractive, boring, dull, lonely, and lives somewhere else. i just spend all my time in my room watching anime or ranting and crying to my cousin who i think of as the dearest person on my life. it’s dumb ik, i mean having a cousin who you think of as the most important person in your life or sister. she’s also just like me. by that i mean same everything, opinions, likes dislikes suicidal maniacs ,abusive parents ,shit like that. 

i wanna die, i’m sick of life, only reasons why is bc i don’t wanna go to hell, and i’m too much of a pussy to hurt myself, bc i get hurt easily and hate pain, but i wanna die a painless quick death and live an ok afterlife in heaven. probably reunite with my grand aunt and a few people i want to see again. 
this shit hurts."

rae_jule,lonely,1620386293.0,i feel like i lost my friends and i was a part of the problem but they say they're still my friends,"before you read,, 1. spoilers are going to be bad words because I just want to vent and have people help me.2. this started because of a dumb math question. me and one girl, lets call her A, had a lot of tense>! shit!< between us already, so you can already tell I was annoyed because of other things that have happened. i will explain this stuff at the end of the post.

so a couple weeks ago, me + 2 other ppl (one is my ""friend""..? we will call her S, and A) were talking about a stupid PEMDAS question.I was just explaining that PEMDAS and BEDMAS is the same. i think we all got heated bc of different sides and idk it just happens that when people are frustrated we tend to get aggressive. I think I was annoyed because, I was explaining to S, and she wasn't listening to what I was saying and kept going with her own thing because she thought she was right. anyways, I really don't care about pemdas, it was a joke to show the equation and have them answer it and see if they got it right. i didn't mean any arguing to start.

anyways, we were all annoyed and (honestly I'm not sure how it even started) but we all got really mad at each other. i then proceeded to say some >!shitty!< stuff to A (I basically told her I wont miss A when she moves because i just want someone who doesnt judge me for what i say and how i act) I KNOW THAT IT WAS WRONG.  please don't tell me because it will make me feel worse LOLS and A literally told me to say it, and I was already mad that A kept saying things like K and just not responding literally and just saying nevermind, and I didnt want to act like her because its annoying (will talk about it later)

so i said that and they both got mad at me because i said it when they wanted me to, and i told them the times A judged me and they got mad for setting boundaries and distancing myself from A which she got mad about bc apparently i wasnt giving them enough clues. I think not responding to texts and just saying things that meant that i didnt really want to talk to A.

then they proceed to yell at me for being sad/disappointed bc of a relationship thing

(basically, A asked me to be her valentine and I said yes but I don't know if i want it to be romantic or just as friends, and then my friend, T, asked A out the day after valentines, and A, apparently having private feelings about T, ditches all her feelings for me and goes and dates T. their relationship didn't work out.)

and then S and A tell me I wasnt giving A enough hints that i was interested and I wasn't giving enough effort, so she moved on, apparently.then S and A proceeded to tell me that I shouldve just chose my feelings (that i liked A or not)and then after A just switched to dating T I put a song on my private instagram (IM SORRY ITS SO CRINGEY BUT I DID IT)and A had to bring it up and tell me I was overreacting because I put it on my story. Then also proceeded to quiz me on Rod Wave, and I calmly told her that just because I knew one of their songs doesn't mean I know/am a fan of the actual artist and told me i overreacted because i put a song on my story..?

and then R (another girl who idk if shes my friend anymore) came in and confronted me A and S and started to turn on me but also got mad at S and A for this argument

anyways that was that and A and I arent friends anymore, and I have no idea what to do. I feel like all three of them (A, S and R) are talking about me behind my back, cause I talked to R and asked her if they had a groupchat together and they said yes, but not to talk about me or a gc which is like ""oh no don't add her"" type of thing and i feel like im just left out bc they call and do a lot of >!shit!< there w/o me and i feel like they dont like me anymore

so the thing that i was talking about earlier - that happened with me and A

in my priv dms, i asked for a phone number of another girl cause i wanted to talk to her about schools. then A comes and confronts me and says like - ""you always have your ways"" and tells me that ""you should think about how you've been acting"" and then tells me nevermind.  
so i tell her, idk how ive been acting  
and then tells me that ive been leaving her on delivered and ignoring me when she talks to me, when i've been choosing not to because she always ruined my mental health bc of other stuff thats happened (she also outed me to R :\[ ) as well as the whole dating T thing  
i send her a long paragraph of how she's done some mean >!shit!< that i dont appreciate, and she just sends me ""cool"" and i tell her that my mental health issues arent cool  
and then she proceeds to come at me with ""and what do u care abt my mental health, if u want me to care for urs"" which doesnt really make sense  
anyways, i tell her that now that i've proved her wrong she just backs down and she comes at me with the classic ""you want a medal"" and ""you never think about what others feel"" and i tell her that I do care about how people feel, everyday, but that if someone treats me like she did i probably don't care about what she feels (because i never talk to her other than school) and then she tells me that ""every single day you're bugging me"" and honestly, what am i supposed to do about it? and then tells me she didnt actually out me that R just ""figured it out"" after the T relationship thing  
and she tells me that shes trying to gain my trust back and i tell her that thats nice, but it doesnt really happen after she betrayed it more than once :)

then a couple days later she says sorry.

&#x200B;

now idk what to do with T and S because they mean so much to me but apparently they leave me out and i want to confront them but i know theyll just be pissed that i have my own feelings and emotions.

please help me and let me know wtf to do <3"
sunshine1034,lonely,1620094174.0,Going to college was not as expected and now I’m lonely as ever,"I thought going into college I would be making life-long friends, and create memories I would forever remember as I was always told. However, I couldn’t be any more lonelier. I haven’t made any real friends at my school and it’s extremely hard considering I don’t live on campus. The only opportunities I have to meet people are during class and you can’t really talk during class. I live almost two hours away from any family or close friends I’ve had. The only time I don’t feel lonely is when I get to visit over summer and I’m surrounded by the people I love. It’s so incredibly depressing not having a social life at all. I was so desperate to meet new people that I went to a few parties, and risked my own safety and others just to have a social outing. I ended up getting too drunk, and everyone hated me. I was called “annoying” and told I was acting childish by seriously, almost everyone there. I even got threats from some random ass guys. It didn’t go well at all and it was a stupid idea to go to a party in the middle of a pandemic in the first place. But I just got so tired of laying in bed all day with nobody to talk to. I’ve tried for so long to make new friends but I don’t seem to have the personality that attracts people. I can come off as a bitch or intimidating but I’m always extremely nice and caring when people take the time to get to know me. I don’t really understand why I’m having such a hard time making friends, considering I’m extremely extroverted. Which is why I feel so uncomfortable being alone often. I seem to meet people but never form close relationships with them. Is this just part of growing up & maturing? I’m still trying to find my way through this bullshit."
FilthyGorgeous1221,lonely,1620212981.0,The support system factor,"My depression & anxiety is out of control, Its by far the worst it’s ever been.  I’ve done pretty much everything, I’ve been on every antidepressant out there, countless therapists, support groups, even a brief hospitalization and ever single thing has been a bandaid fix at best.  The reason I always fail & ultimately end up back hiding from the world in bed is because I have no support system to help me with the bad moments.  I used to have a loving family that would always lift me up but now the ones who truly loved me are dead & the remainder of my family turned their backs on me.  I don’t have any friends left, I don’t have a job because I am on disability right now & unable to work which means I literally spend 100% of my time alone, the only human interaction I get is saying hi to the pharmacist when I pick up my meds.....

I don’t remember what it feels like to be loved 

I can take the strongest medication available or go through the best mental health program possible but at the end of the day I am completely alone & unloved. So I keep asking myself what is the point? 

Everyone complains about their family & takes them for granted .... but I’d do absolutely anything in this world just for 1 person I could call real family. 

I don’t have it in me anymore .... I quit ...."

throwawayokina,lonely,1619931016.0,I hugged someone,"I hugged someone in a dream. My dreams are typically very vague and I do not feel much sensation (vision, hearing, touch) while in it; rather it is characterised by events and people. But this dream gave me a complete sensory overload.

 We were at a house party/gathering and I was chilling about with my friends. Suddenly, I heard someone ring the doorbell. I went to open the door, only to see my classmate and ex-crush crying. Like the kind of crying where you know something groundbreakingly bad has happened. Before I knew it, I jumped forward into a tight hug, feeling absolutely shitty about how I could not help her.

I could feel everything. My palms on her back. Our chins resting on each others' shoulders. The warmth of a hug. 

The reality of the experience was second only to real life. Words alone cannot describe how strong I felt the emotions and sensations. 

I have several good friends. But as my friends don't show physical affection, this was the first time I had a hug this powerful and emotional. 

I realise now that I am horribly starved of physical affection - till the point that my brain created a situation to fulfill this subconscious desire. I'm even surprised that my brain could even remember the sensation of being in a hug.

Thank you for reading my rant. Wishing you have a good day/night ahead."

chesterbryce,lonely,1620602573.0,Who is overwhelmed by life,"Part of the loneliness that I've experienced had to do with being overwhelmed with life. This had to do with not knowing what exactly I wanted to do, or which direction to go in. Overtime, I've come up with solid methods to keep me going, which also boosted my resilience to life's obstacles immensely. 

I've always found playing video games much more satisfying and effortless than real life. And I think like a lot of people, we've all had the thought of what life would be like if it were a video game.

I've built an app to help me organize my life and it's working really well right now that some friends have started using it. If anyone is interested in optimizing their life, let me know

Throughout all of 2020 we talked everyday for hours. Even though we would just txt I'd become so immersed in a our conversations that it almost felt like we were really together.

She says nothing has changed that it's just work, but I think there is something else. Ive not been dealing with it well.

Last night I forced myself to drink 2 beers. 


It was 1am, I was outside sitting near a pond. The taste was absolutely disgusting. But I forced myself. After finishing one, I decided not to drink the second because I wasn't feeling anything and hated the taste. So I walked back home.


By the time I reached, it started to hit me so I drank the second to amplify it. Forced it down in my room. 


Then after I finished, I threw up into the toilet because of how disgusting it was. 

I should also add that I hate carbonated drinks, so that made it worse haha


Then I brushed, changed and slept. The lightheaded feeling went away after I threw up which was disappointing but oh well

I’m a naturally caring and supportive person and I truly cared about her and her well being. Now I feel like I have lost a friend and it’s making my depression and loneliness even worse. I have what feels like a deep and empty pit in my stomach and I get random waves of anxiety that almost bring me to tears. Its been a few days now and the feeling will not go away. I’ve tried to stop thinking about it but I can’t. I really just want human connection and true friendship and someone to care about me the way I care about them.

I also remembered that when I was a little kid, life seemed so much better. I had friend , didn’t have to bother with of complicated math and didn’t have to wonder if my hair cut was “cool” enough. It made me feel really alone to think that the days when I could play an hour straight without being bored, just having fun and being happy won’t ever be here. I’m just going to be 13,14,15y/o, finish school, get a boring job and finish at   65y/o, with a normal amount of money, probably no kid, no passion, just there alone thinking “I had a worthless life, did nothing good, nothing bad, just a boring and long life, for nothing “ and I don’t think I want that.

rainpawsherbet,lonely,1620208569.0,I don't know how to connect with other people. Please help me,"I just recently got into college and I know the immediate thing I should do to survive is to make friends so that I don't have to go through everything on my own. Especially knowing that college life wasn't going to be easier than high school. Unfortunately, making friends has never been something that I can do with ease.

 I've talked to some of my classmates several times, but no one seems to be interested in being friends with me. I feel like no matter how hard I try to initiate a friendship, it always ends up with them being not more than just acquaintances or people I know from college. I don't know whether it's my boring personality or that I'm just not likeable. I have social anxiety, am very shy and quiet, but it's not like I haven't made any effort to interact with other people. Socializing takes huge courage and I would be beating myself up If I mess up the slightest bit of my social interactions.

I  know that later in the future when I finally graduate college and continue to working life, this is going to be a greater problem because If I'm not able to form connections with people, I wouldn't have the chance to get a decent job or even a job at all since we all know how important networking is in professional world.

I'm aware that this is all my fault because it doesn't only happen in college. Ever since I was in kindergarten, I never really had decent amount of friends and had often sat alone because no one would wanna talk to me. Everywhere I go, it all comes back to me being friendless, lonely, and depressed. What's the point of living if we, humans, as social creatures aren't even capable of being social? 

What am I supposed to do? I'm tired of having no connections with people around me. Please, anyone, I need answers."

Getagripkid,lonely,1620080179.0,Feel like I’m losing a lot of friends,"
I’m a postgrad student, and I’ve realized that lately, a lot of the friends I made in highschool and undergrad don’t talk to me anymore. Some I’ve messaged once or even twice, and never even got a reply. I understand everyone at this age is going through it, trying to figure themselves out, moving cities or countries, getting jobs, getting into relationships, making new friends in new places, or simply moving on. And I 100% support that; it just sucks when you feel like you’re being left behind... I know that in life, people change and outgrow past relationships. So there are moments when I think to myself ‘oh, that person has probably just outgrown this relationship with me, or they’re just too busy and I’m simply not a priority anymore.. or maybe I wasn’t to begin with?’. I’m someone who struggles with being alone, and I’m trying to learn how to do that, to accept that life goes on and it’s okay to not have that many friends. But it’s just been very difficult lately, when you see everyone is getting on with their lives, and the ones that are still left... seem to slowly be slipping away, while I’m trying my very best to hold on to the few lasting friendships I have left, and I feel like a burden to the ones who are still here. It’s been a tough year, just struggling to navigate this feat in particular."
aneptuniangrl,lonely,1620076831.0,Am I jealous or is there something there?,"Hi guys. So I’m a 21F and i have this friend that I’m not sure I’m jealous of or if she’s weird. I can say I think she’s prettier than me but I also think I’m pretty as well. Whenever we go, men will completely IGNORE me and try to talk to her forwardly. Sometimes there’s the awkward moment where I told her I have my eyes on a guy and he asks me for HER number. It hurts but I let it go. 

Now when she has a new boy toy, she introduces me and my personality tends to sparkle more than hers. There was this one moment where she showed me on FaceTime to a guy and he called me cute and she said “cute?!” In this jealous way towards him. And when we first smoked weed together there were times where it felt like she thought I was ugly or would become super sensitive and lash out. 

So she texts me one day to tell me she met this guy friend and he’s cute and she wants to hook us up so we can double date with her boyfriend. Automatically i cringed bc I hate blind dates but also bc the last guy she hooked me up with liked her instead. So I’m hesitant blah blah he calls me cute and gets my Instagram info. Now...later that night he sends her a screenshot of the ONE picture me and her have together and calls her a star. From that moment on I knew he liked her. Fast forward a few months later she tells me that he kissed her in his car. This pissed me off bc why would u try to hook us up if u knew all along he liked her. I literally told her that first day to make sure he doesn’t like her and she was so confident, that now it seems like she was full of shit. 

But she tearfully assured me that wasn’t what she was trying to do. She rebuffs his advances and never speaks to him again. Fast forward to some months later, she broke up with her boyfriend and is chatting with me and brings up that same guy. This time she’s speaking like she’s thinking about hooking up with him and the whole time I’m wondering if she forgot I was mad about that and that this isn’t a good look.

Am I wrong to be pissed off? Like I have feelings. I know damn well when a guy is attracted to me so I feel like she knew too but she felt she could throw him to me. Is this jealousy bc of how overlooked I feel sometimes or what?"

I don't think words are enough for me to trust anyone anymore, which is the only thing that can even be fucking exchanged here. And no one around me would give me anything, not even words. If you have nothing to say, don't. I don't want to see you sucking your dick in front of me. All I want is for someone to hug me and to tell me it's all okay, and no one can do that.

marmalademadam,lonely,1619939996.0,It hurts so much to lose a friend,"I feel like I’m missing a member of my family. My world got colder and smaller since. Especially since he’s alive. And we’re just missing out on each other’s lives now. 

I just feel like I’m not *done* being his friend. I feel like he’s my family. But I’ve done more than my share of fighting for him. I reached out twice but he never took my hand. 

We had a lot of issues between us, so I decided that it was healthy to take some space. I think he partly felt like he had screwed things up to a point that he couldn’t possibly fix any of it. That I hated him now or something. 

But all I needed was a genuine apology or a chance to talk things out. I tried to talk things and always kept my language neutral and chose my words so carefully but his self hatred got in the way. 

I feel unbearably lonely. He let go. He gave me no choice but to force myself to move on, but I feel stuck. I reach out for my phone sometimes and remember that he’s not on my chat list. Or I have dreams about him every night and they feel so real. 

It’s ironic because I have plenty of other friends and deep connections, so I’m not “lonely” on surface, but to lose someone that close to me makes me feel like I’ve lost ten people at once."

I did not make many friends although I briefly had a ""girl friend"". This is in quotes because I'm not sure if we were in love as she avoided me most of the time (in public but we talk online since she left the country where I am and she says she misses me a lot, weird).
I am about to graduate and go back home having not gone there since I left and don't know how I'll answer questions about my time here. People expect living abroad to be fun, but for me it has been the loneliest and most boring phase of my life.
If it helps, I am non white in an Asian country. I sometimes wish I had tried to ask someone out.

Will I ever make new friends and find love? I really wish I would feel love again.

Meat_Bus,lonely,1619947818.0,Gonna be by myself for a while,"So, the past few years for me have been bliss. Throughout high school I was a huge loner, but I guess I didn’t really realize how negatively it was affecting me. I switched into a boarding school my sophomore year in high school and immediately found my home. The next 3 years living in that dorm were amazing, I had friends that understood me and they’re honestly family to me for life. When we all went off to college, most of us split off all across the country, so we knew we wouldn’t be seeing each other anymore. I’ve kept contact with 3 of them, moving in and sharing a house with one of them. Fast forward to now, I’ve been in college 3 years and still have about 2 years to go. I have a wonderful girlfriend who I’ve been dating for 2 1/2 years now, and I can’t wait to marry her. She’s the love of my life and I know she’s gonna be my wife. We’ve lived together with one of my best friends from high school for about 2 years. But now everything is changing. My girlfriend is in med tech and is going back to our hometown (3 1/2 hour drive from me) with our dog for her internship, which will last for a year. My best friend is graduating this year. He has a job working for Amazon now as a software engineer and is moving to Virginia (we are currently in Louisiana.) My other two best friends live about 4 hours away from me at any point in time, and I hardly have time to travel given my engineering degree I’m working towards. I mainly interact with my buddies via discord, and was part of a fairly large group but for the past month nearly all of them have just been gone. Not sure why, most likely that’s a whole other story, but long story short I guess I just won’t be talking to them anymore, so that’s sad considering we all talked daily for the better part of 3 years, me taking the time to build this small community and introduce everybody, bringing them together just to watch them leave. All to sum up, by the end of the month, I’m going to be the most alone that I’ve been in YEARS. And I guess I just don’t know how I ever handled it before, or how to now. I’m so used to being able to talk to someone I’m close to every day that this past month just without the buddies I had online is driving me crazy, I don’t know how I’m going to handle being completely alone, working on these stupidly hard classes just trying to get my degree so I can get out and marry my girlfriend. 

Sorry if that was a long read, I appreciate if any of you took the time to.

I'm 30 and have had some matches online, but conversation is brief and I get ghosted, when I suggest a time to meet for a date, they always suggest we talk more first and it ends up going ghost

It seems as if these days online dating is more or less how most people meet to hook up or see if there's a connection....that is unless you go to a bar and meet.

lexiebeef,lonely,1620148317.0,I lost the one quality I always had,"First of all, let me give you some context. Since I (F21) can remember, I was never the pretty one (always a tomboy and not the cool type) and I never was the nice person (Im not saying Im an asshole, but the word people most use to describe me is def not nice). But one thing I always had were brains. Im no genious, at all, but I always studied a lot (it helps when you have 0 friends) and so I always had great grades. I always won fights about controversial topics (race, sexuality, politics...) and that was kind of my most visible quality.

But in the last year, I lost that. Im in my third year of law school and this semester I always say everything wrong, my grades are shit and a professor literally told me today “you talk in a terrible way”.  Besides that, this year has been so exausthing I just lost all track of news and whatever, making me always being criticized at every discussion. And for some reason, people have been complaining about the way i talk a lot (too loud, too fast, with a lisp...). 

Im not saying every person will relate to this, but it was the one thing I had garanteed was that, even if I would end up alone, I would have a good job, where I could do a meaningful thing. And now, I dont even have that.

Basically, what I feel is that instead of improving and becoming a better person, I am losing the few good things. And that sucks, because it makes me understand why I am so alone. 

Why would anyone like me if I suck?"
Prince-scooby,lonely,1620098502.0,Stagnant and lonely,"It’s like the world continuously throws things in my path to keep me from gaining independence, my ex takes my birth certificate so I can’t work, I can’t get a new one without an ID (need birth certificate for) my family keeps on trying to say wait but nothing ever changes and I’m tired of wasting my life while I’m young, I feel like I’ve been abused by the world for my entire life and now that I’m at the age to be free I can’t do a single damn thing, not being able to make money for myself without being able to work, constantly getting battered by family when I have a mental breakdown or flip shit, my love life is absolutely shitting on me, and I’m always the person people see as the most confident uplifting person but I feel like I’m falling apart 24/7 stuck at the house, having to rely on others just to leave and have fun, losing people. Family pressure, societal problems, everything just constantly makes it feel like it’s hard to breathe and my vision gets wavy. Mental health is something nobody gets help for in my community and it’s frowned upon when a guy is feeling anything, it’s gotten to the point that I don’t feel like opening up to anyone bc they will either hurt me or use it against me. I’m losing my mind and just my will to live is constantly wavering even tho I know I can’t stop until I can help others like me, but getting support or any way to take ahold of my dream is becoming impossible. It’s like anything and everything I try to do fails or backfires in my face."

thetranquilearth,lonely,1620628971.0,struggling a lot,"I don't really have friends that I regularly talk to besides family. But one of the few people I did kind of have, for a while... idk if we're going to talk again.

I couldn't handle the ambiguity and uncertainty of our relationship, because he has too much shit to work through to be able to tell me whether he wants to be with me platonically or romantically. I'm in love with him, but even if he'd decided he just wanted to be friends, that would be okay. I would move on eventually. But I couldn't make myself move on like that when I knew there was a chance that once he worked through his trauma and various mental health issues, he'd realize he wanted me the way he said he did when he was drunk.

Seeing his name every day on Discord, him messaging me occasionally, it's been fucking me up emotionally a lot. I'm so lonely in general, it's hard not having any local friends, and having him ""there"", but not really was just too painful. I felt constantly rejected. I don't blame him at all, but I needed a break, and told him so today, asking him to get back in touch with me when he's decided on something (relationship, friendship, no contact, whatever - I just want to know what he really wants). And I'm pretty sure it hurt him, or bothered him, or something, because of the way he replied.

I'm going to reach out to people, going to try and be as social as I can, because I'm done making this mistake. Rejection happens, but I can't keep going on like this, isolated from other people. It messes up other areas of my life, and I let my anxiety hold me back from developing solid connections, so all I ever *know* is rejection.

It hurts so much though. I don't know if he'll actually get back to me. His last words to me were ""not really"". When I said I loved him, he didn't return it, despite telling me he loved me literally last night.

I'll probably delete this later, I'm just hurting a lot rn."
chickenlessb0ne,lonely,1620590858.0,How to build yourself into not being lonely,"Hello all. Just want to start off by saying if you’re lonely, you’re not alone. There’s nothing wrong with you. Billions of people across the globe feel the same way. Study after study shows that with an increase in our reliance on technology, especially with the pandemic, there’s an increase in individuals experiencing loneliness. Many of you may actually enjoy being alone like me! You come home, make some food, take a seat, boot up that PS4/pick up that guitar/turn on the TV, rain begins coming down slowly, and with no work tomorrow you get to chill all by yourself. It’s an amazing feeling... until you do this, over and over again, and the feelings every human experiences of being in a tribe/community/relationship (that word can hurt) begins to kick in and you realize that being alone doesn’t actually make you...happy. Believe me, I’ve experienced this for YEARS, and it’s a long, painful process to make friends, find outgoing hobbies, meet people and create adventures, but it’s entirely do-able. Here’s what I suggest so you don’t make the same mistakes I did. 

1- Workout 
-I know it’s not easy, especially in a pandemic but I can’t even begin to explain all the benefits to working out. It’s sounds dumb, but it makes you happier, more confident, obviously better looking, and fills you with a sense of pride and accomplishment. I recommend creating a goal for yourself and sticking with a training plan. I became very passionate about running and it was super awesome. Although you won’t begin to see the results for a while, the more you do it, the more you’ll want to keep going back. 

2- Try Bumble friends/Facebook groups 
-You don’t even need to find friends naturally anymore, you can quite literally meet people through the internet now. Some of the best in-person friends that I’ve made were through social media/apps. When it comes to dating apps, I’d wait until you made some friends first. Having a social circle is the most basic building block of not being lonely. Relationships will come in time, and if they don’t work out you have friends to fall back on. 

3- Try and find new hobbies 
-Having new and interesting hobbies (even ones that you do alone) will really help create an interesting you. For me, it was bread-making, cooking, guitar playing, painting, finding a hiking/biking Facebook group, and joining a community service group. Also, journaling really helps put thoughts down on paper to clear your mind. Shoot your shot at tons of different hobbies and I guarantee a few will stick long term. 

4- Be as nice as possible to anyone and everyone you meet 
-This is for those who have social anxiety/are socially awkward. Not only does a smile make people instantly like you more and want to keep you around, you will quite literally make yourself happy. Yes, it maybe putting on a face, but do it until it becomes your actual face. 

5- Read “How to Win Friends and Influence people” by Dale Carnegie
-For me, it’s essentially the ultimate tactical book for dealing with people, and it kinda changed my life. Meeting new people and not being lonely means you need to understand people. You’ve spent years understanding yourself, now it’s time you understand everyone else. 

6- “If it makes you nervous, do it”
-Walking into the gym makes you feel intimidated? Do it anyway. Hopping on Tinder makes you feel nervous and more lonely? Do it anyway (but don’t binge). Don’t even want to get out of bed??? Do it anyway. Trying the things you hate the most will open up more doors than you thought possible. Breaking out of your comfort zone means putting yourself in positions of being uncomfortable, but it’s super exciting. Life, for me at least, was meant to be an adventure, not a day to day drone of things that aren’t exciting. 

I don’t want to come off as some motivational speaker, but PLEASE understand that it’s NEVER too late, even if you’re 45-50 years old, you can still get the fuck out there and change your life, because I did and I feel great. This isn’t going to come as some 80s montage either; it’s going to be hard work but it’s with worth it. 5 years ago I was lurking very often on this subreddit, and now I’m happier than ever. Sure, sometimes I don’t even want to get out of bed, and I’ve gotten my heart broken more times that I can count, but it’s definitely allot more adventurous than living my life though a fucking screen. I implore you, please try everything I said earlier. When it comes to burnout, of course try everything in moderation. There will be some days you don’t want to get up, or you continue to feel lonely MONTHS after trying new things. The time will come, I know it because it happened to me. A year in to rebuilding myself, I still spent Friday nights alone. Trust the process and take this as an adventure, like a quest in some kind of video game, and get out there and start living life. That one friend you make can turn into 3, 4, 8, and eventually a whole circle of amigos to hang with. If you’re looking for a relationship, never stop looking. Love can be around every corner, you just have to have the strength to reach every corner. Please remember confidence is key, you will get your heart broken but it’s better than never even trying.

This is your life, now fight for it. Whatever YouTube video, book, quote, saying, motivational whatever the fuck gets you up and moving, use it. For me, it was Man of Steel (the movie). It took me 5 YEARS to build myself from a chubby 17 year old depressed kid who played 8+ hours of games a day to a 22 year old guy who genuinely enjoys life. I didn’t hold a girls hand until I was 21, and that’s OK! I never even thought that I would even be able to TALK to girls, and now I do on a daily basis, and YOU CAN TOO (or dudes if that’s your thing). 

I hope this message finds you well. Just understand that what you maybe going through right now is just a low point in your life, and the highs have yet to come. Build yourself day in and day out, and your future you will thank the present you, because I currently thank the past me for going through all his trials and tribulations, and to have the strength to get out of bed and stop staring at a screen.

Not knowing anybody out here beyond extended family has been really rough. I'm making leaps and bounds to become a better human but I want to move closer to home in the PNW. I'm working very hard to rebuild my life and I'm finding it harder and harder every day to continue this lonely existence. I've never put a ton of value on having social connections but now that I have close to none I can see how the lack of contact can destroy a person. I want so badly to develop some friendships, but I have no idea where to start. I'm 28, I don't really go to public events and even if I did I'm way too introverted to try and talk to strangers in a public setting. I'm going to be moving in a month and I'm going to have to find a roommate, I'm terrified of the entire process.

Trying to find some one to date is a big failure. Any time i post or match with some one on an app its just some stupid scam. When i do find an actual person i end up being ghosted which just destroys what little confidence i have. Between the shitty relationship i had. Then the last person i dated cheating on me and then everything else i just want to give up. Its to depressing to think about and i just want to sleep all day. But i cant do that because i have to work at a place where i get bitched at by people because they dont know what theyre doing. I question every day where i went wrong in my life to end up where im at now. Could i have made a different choice and had a better out come? Probably but my dumb ass has to pick the wrong choice every time. So now i lay here every night alone with not one to talk to. Hating everything about my life at the moment. I just dont know what to do any more.

unuavi,lonely,1619873637.0,Always socially isolating,"Why do I keep pushing friends and family away... I usually eventually try to fix my mistake of ghosting for months or years by trying to reconnect but things are never the same and it's even more difficult to hold a conversation. I just feel like I'm gonna suffocate whenever I reconnect because it was my fault because I felt like a horrible friend or person and that they are better off without me. 

They kinda show that they are better without me by never trying to initiate another conversation after I never respond the first time they never try again that's why I feel comfortable ghosting because it felt like they didn't want to talk to me anyways. A lot of conversations are started by me despite my horrible anxiety because I really try to change and keep friends and try to get close but they consistently show me that it seems that they don't want to talk to me at all so I distance myself so far and ghost for months. Even friends that I had so much fun talking to seem like they don't want to talk to me because they don't start conversations. So again I disappear. I hate this and I've lost all my friends can't talk like I used to just trying to not be negative like I always am. So then we never talk again. I try so hard but everyone makes me feel so unwanted and annoying. I just wanna die for feeling this way about them I just feel like trash. I have a spending problem because I feel so empty inside.

MyNamePrecedesMe,lonely,1619846093.0,I need someone to help me stay sane and there's no one to help me stay sane,"I have severe PTSD.

There have only been two places who will accept me that I could actually live in and literally both of the landlords are trying to find ways to steal from me.

I can't go out and meet people because I have a fear of being in public for long and it stresses me terribly to talk to people I don't know in person. (I come off normal but it takes a great toll so I can't do it all the time.) I have three people in my life and they're all toxic, but I feel like I can't cut them out because they're the only people that exist to me and I can't meet anyone new. One is an 'ex' who's still very emotionally abuse to me even though he moved away. One is another ex, same basic situation but not so much abusive as just a clinical narcissist who uses everyone. And finally my very rageful, emotionally unstable sister, whom I don't talk to much. (The reason for the PTSD is related to extensive childhood abuse so I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the history of abuse and the fact that my sister is unstable.)

So everyone just says ""Oh he told you you'll never do anything right and all your childhood abuse is your fault and you're a moron etc etc? Well just stop talking to him."" But I'm already losing my mind because there's no one to talk to and everything is falling apart. I can't find a place to live and I might lose my chance to move to move. My washtub just broke.

To summaries how i i found my self in this position. I had a procedure which went wrong and has led to limited mobility in 2018, i had prior issues which are probably relevant. I am currently 23 and have no friends or family. I question whether people would want to be friends with me, would they just pity me (my life is far from okay and many specialists are surprised i have not killed myself yet).

How do i get out of this state of mind ? All my conversations are simple hellos and i try to engage with others in my hobby but i do not know how to make friends or that i even people would want to be friends. 

I had a 7 year relationship and a thriving social life with many great people in the first few years but since ending that\`14 months ago i have no one.

TheOtherNPC,lonely,1620287739.0,I’m done with my local “club” as they literally don’t care about me or what I do,"When I moved to my current town in 2018 I had no friends or family in the area so I joined a local sports club to try and meet people.

It was clear they weren’t the most sociable bunch but it was a start. After 5 months they hit hard times as they were too lazy to recruit new people as old ones left. I bent over backwards advertising online and putting up flyers which worked to bring in new people while they just moaned about how screwed the club was. Not once did I get a thank you but I thought it would count for something in the long run. 

Covid hit and we shut down, not one person spoke to me since last March even if I reached out to people, until recently when I was contact to ask to basically dig them out a hole because they didn’t bother to rebook the usual venue so have no where to host it. I said no, I wasn’t rude but just I couldn’t. 

Guess what, not even a reply and every time I’ve commented or posted on our clubs pages they ignore me. To test this I did offer to “help” and suddenly I got bombarded with people asking how I was, what I was up too all with the end point of trying to force ideas on what to do on me because they’re too lazy to do it.

I put my all into that club and i feel lonlier then ever as it’s clear they don’t like or value me as a person, just what I can give them.

Edit : looking back on my vent I didn’t really make it clear. I feel lonlier now then I did because while I didn’t make friends at it, I fell a sense of being part of the community. However the attitude of the members have shown me I’m not valued or even recognised unless it benefits them and that’s what’s made me feel lonlier then ever as while I haven’t made friends from it, I’m also not part of that community despite being part of that community!"

just_some_toast,lonely,1620371078.0,I think I was just born to die alone,"This is the first time I've ever done something like this so forgive me if it's all over the place and messy.

Ever since I can remember I've always been invisible to everyone around me. I was always the last one to be picked in gym class and the last person to be picked for any group assignments. I was never invited to birthday parties, or sleep overs, or to just hang out because I was never anyone's friend. Needless to say that I never went to Homecoming or Prom because I've never had a girlfriend either. Sure I had some ""friends"" back in highschool, but I always felt in the back of my mind that they didn’t really think of me as a friend. They never invited me to hang out or were always ""busy"" when I invited them. And sure enough, right after graduation every single one of them just stopped talking to me. Now I'm 20 years old and have no one. I'm not saying it's everyone else's fault, because I know it's not. I know I wasn't the most social person because of my social anxiety, and my depression probably made me seem off-putting as well, but I always tried my damn hardest to talk to people and try to make friends. It just wasn't enough I guess, or maybe I wasn't, I don't know. All I know is that I'm a 20 year-old, friendless, unemployed, college flunky, who has never even been kissed by a girl before, and by the looks of it, that's how it's always going to be. I feel like I don't even exist sometimes. I just want to be noticed."

dontcallmelaterlv,lonely,1619826655.0,"The loneliness of Regret, then came covid","I am a 45 year old single male living in Las Vegas Nevada. I am originally from Southern New Jersey and I've been living here in Las Vegas for about 16 years.

I was married in 2001. My marriage ended in 2012 and I live with the regret from a decision that I made that led to the ending of our marriage. Allow me to explain.

In 2011 I took a acoustic guitar and started writing songs. By 2012 I started performing these songs live. At the time we were living in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. My songs are unique and mediately catchy to anybody that listen to them. So as I quickly gained popularity in Philadelphia I figured why not move to Las Vegas where we lived prior. Add a marketing background and a keen sense of branding and I figured my music mixed with those skills would take off here. So we made plans and in August of 2012 I made my way to Las Vegas for a second time. My then-wife was supposed to follow two months later.

While I was here in Las Vegas making preparations for her to move here. She got it in her head and made the decision that she didn't want to be with me anymore. And the reason why is because my decision to become a songwriter conflicted with the social construct of living and working and making money. I wanted to follow my dreams and because so, I lost my best friend.

Now although my ex-wife and I still talk, I've been drowning in loneliness ever since this all went down. And for a while, this loneliness even though it was depressing, it kept that a pretty standard level of depressing. But the coronavirus pandemic put things in a tighter crunch. The stress created from me losing my job here and dealing with an appointment system and all this other stuff put a strain on our relationship and now I feel completely disconnected from her and it's heartbreaking.

Now I feel lonely like I've never felt before. My depression has sunk to new lows. My anxiety is through the roof. And I'm scared to grow older. I miss my ex-wife the more importantly I missed the many years we shared together in terms of a comfort zone. I have dated since the dissolve of our marriage but none of it was ever the same. As a matter of fact I've had two relationships here that were extremely abusive and now I deal with post-traumatic issues. My ex-wife is well aware of these circumstances. But she wants to live her life and I don't want to stop her from living her life. But it's the equivalent of me on a ship with no engine stranded at Sea just drifting away and I see her getting smaller and smaller. And it brings tears to my eyes and makes my heart sink to the floor.

You see, on my birthday in 2012 I expected a phone call from her wishing me as such, a happy birthday but instead after not receiving a call from her until late in the night, she told me she did not love me anymore. I was crushed. As I stated above, I've been in a drowning state of loneliness ever since. And the Waters of loneliness are getting to reach my breathing capacity. And I fear that I might take my own life in the future.

As I get older I Lose Friends, Stress and Anxiety and post-traumatic situations further isolate me from everyone, you throw in the coronavirus send you have a mixture of misery. I just want love from someone. It's not that I want to be with my ex-wife anymore, I still want her friendship and I will always love her, I'm very sad that our marriage has dissolved I never in my early years expected or wanted any of this. I currently see a therapist for depression and anxiety issues oh, and I also see a doctor because I have a thyroid issue now from years of stress.

I'm sorry I'm rambling but basically what I'm trying to get at is, I am so lonely. And there are times when that loneliness makes me feel so sick. I have no friends anymore. My family doesn't understand anything I do. And I barely talk to my ex-wife anymore. I don't want to be like this. I just want to go back to the way it was. I wish I could go back and change it."
Mr_Anonymous2772,lonely,1619994314.0,I am getting increasingly lonely and paranoid.,"Hello everyone. For the first time in a while this pandemic is beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I am just about the only person in my school year who seems to take the threat of COVID somewhat seriously and therefore I do not attend social gatherings etc. School has only just restarted, but I find it difficult to have the same connections with people. Going on PS4 with my friends was something that kept me in contact with my friends and maintained relationships. We started a Minecraft world (I am 17M btw) on which neatly every night in early 2021 we would work on, and it was great. We kept on doing this until one of my closer friends (Bryan •fake name but just for reference) got a PS4 and joined us. He started getting closer to others in the friend group, and I realize that an inner circle begins to form with him and two others. I am not part of this as I am very occupied with chores and schoolwork. Soon enough, Bryan's girlfriend gets Xbox too, and a larger inner circle is formed. When I went on at night after a long day, I would really enjoy myself until we all went offline. Or so I thought. With little effort to hide it, the ""inner circle"" goes back online immediately afterwards, and does not invite me. I no longer go on ps4 to socialize as no matter how much fun I can have, I feel absolutely crushed when this sort of thing happens. So this group goes on every night playing and bonding together into the late hours, and on one occasion a group of friends that I had gone out with last year to drink and fuck around with all met up without me to celebrate getting into university etc (They are aware I'm also going to university). This just really upsets me, as even though I wouldn't have attended due to COVID restrictions, I would have really liked to have an invite. They were, and still unaware of how careful I am regarding covid. And then later on Bryan and three others go out together and don't invite me. It hurts a lot. It really does. Now I find it hard to enjoy my free time as when my friends don't reply to me for more than 30 minutes I begin wondering whether they are out together or on PS4 together. Recently, Bryan goes out with one of the group to go to town. I don't know what I have done wrong but I am progressively getting more and more paranoid I will be left excluded and replaced from a social life I once had. I am worried I will spend my summer holidays left out of all activities. 

Maybe I just need to accept that I am not as close to a group of friends as previously thought? Bottom line is, I feel like I am losing my closest friend and being replaced in my friend group.
Sorry for the long read, I need to rant."
SmartRecognition7158,lonely,1620110777.0,We are nothing and we’ll become nothing. Living is just the painful intermission,"I don’t love life. I’d say I don’t enjoy living, but I don’t know what it’s like to “live”.

Ever since I can remember I’ve always had no friends. When I was a kid I was too dumb and engrossed in my DS to care. After high school I realized I have no one.

I can’t tell my friends from acquaintances anymore. My family are strangers to me. And once the “adults” are gone and it’s just me and my cousins I can guarantee I’ll be forgotten about completely.

I’ve feel like I’ve got no future, I went to sixth form after secondary school but I’ve been stuck in a retail job (my first job I ever got) for 6 years and I’ve feel like I’ve got no expectations or anything to move forwards toward. My family always push for me to go to Uni but I don’t want to spend 3-4 years on a course unless I’m set on doing something in particular but I can’t find someone that interests me enough to spend 3-4 years studying to do it and then take it up as a career."

I get emotional sometimes for no reason as well. People tell me to stay strong. I try, but it's challenging. 
This Friday, I get my second vaccine of the Moderna. I'm afraid of needles and getting the symptoms.

eternal990,lonely,1620564041.0,Where did I go wrong?,"I was lonely since secondary school with virtually no one to talk to since then. Well, had a high school friend with whom I hanged out once in two months, but since he found a girlfriend, we didn't.

Fun thing, I had my 18th birthday party together with him and another guy. We all invited the same number of people, but no one came to celebrate my birthday. So I sat in a dark corner, drinking beer alone for six hours straight. I have no grudge though, actually I'm glad they enjoyed it so it wasn't a complete failure. Still, then I realized how bad the situation was.

I once had a girlfriend. That is, until I found out she's been cheating on me. After she dumped me(!), she would keep sending me vids I don't want to remember - every other day.  
(Edit: she left the country, we're no longer in touch for few years already)

I don't trust my own shadow now and my self-esteem doesn't exist. I'm probably socially disabled now.

Every day I wake up and check my phone just to read some covid headlines, work 8 hours from home office and then stare at empty walls till I fall asleep at 3 AM.

Maybe I should have got used to it already, yet the awareness that no one's there to even find me dead in my home is devastating, lol. I think I won't escape this.

Thanks for reading xx"

When we have been speaking over social media, they all talk about how they can’t wait to meet up together and do something fun. But then I see on their Instagram/snapchat/ect that they are going out to parties and going out playing sports.
Once they even mentioned to me that they all went out together and it was great and that “you should definitely come next time” as If I chose not to come. And then they don’t tell me again and I see that they have gone out. 

I completely understand if they just don’t like me anymore, but why do they keep telling me I should come next time, or they cant wait to see me, and then go out constantly without telling me?!"

it’s been worse lately i think because my best friend and i broke up about a month ago. i’ve been coping with it better than i might’ve last year, but it still hurts a lot nonetheless. i felt she was one of the only people i could talk to.

my only other friend is non-responsive most of the time. it sucks responding to him in a few minutes only for him to take 24 hours to respond to me. i get he’s probably busy or something but it still makes me feel not even worth a text when i see him active on social media 

i only really have a few months left of this since i’ll be starting college in the fall where i’m gonna do my best to be outgoing as possible because i hate loneliness so much. but the last few months and the months to come are just hard to think about

it used to be worse though so if i survived the last few years and my whole life i can do this. i just needed a place to vent. i hope everyone else feels better too"

Anyways, last night i texted my old friend that i havent spoken to in 4 years. i told her that i was sorry and how i regret losing her and that i missed her. she accepted my apology and just told me not to worry about it and how she is or was never mad at me for it. we talked for a bit, we didnt really catch up on eachother. in conclusion i basically apologized and she didnt care and moved on. i told her ""goodnight"" and that was it. i was really hoping we couldve restarted and be friends again. it sucks it sucks. I have no one to talk to, i have no one to talk to about anything, im fucking alone. and i think thats how its going to be forever. its starting to get to me now, im about to go to college."

The only mainstream project I've seen it in was ALBERT, where one version used adaptive computation time to determine the number of copies of layers to run.

It seems like this would be hugely important as it allows for iterative refinement of a speculative output, like many networks, but for a dynamic number of times, decided by the network. Originally it was implemented for RNNs, but I think its pretty trivial to implement it for most other architectures. I would surely think this could be implemented with a Mixture of Experts model where the model can rerun the same layers and choose a different expert each time, which could allow for big parameter space without having to be constrained to using one or two experts each forward pass. Maybe I'm overhyping ACT and its really not very useful, but is there any reason that it hasn't seen more widespread adoption?"

I'm trying to get the intuition behind positional embeddings described in the famous paper [*""Attention is all you need""*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). It makes total sense for me but I notice one caveat.

I make a case where a particular tokenized word at position x might result in the same vector as another word at another position.

Let me make up a case for it:

    representation_1 = tokenize(""learning"") + positional_embedding(position=1)
    representation_2 = tokenize(""other"") + positional_embedding(position=20)
    representation_1 == representation_2

Title: 'Bio-Inspired Robustness: A Review '

Arxiv link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09265](https://t.co/m1lZbQqhEW?amp=1)

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have revolutionized computer vision and are often advocated as good models of the human visual system. However, there are currently many shortcomings of DCNNs, which preclude them as a model of human vision. For example, in the case of adversarial attacks, where adding small amounts of noise to an image, including an object, can lead to strong misclassification of that object. But for humans, the noise is often invisible. If vulnerability to adversarial noise cannot be fixed, DCNNs cannot be taken as serious models of human vision. Many studies have tried to add features of the human visual system to DCNNs to make them robust against adversarial attacks. However, it is not fully clear whether human vision-inspired components increase robustness because performance evaluations of these novel components in DCNNs are often inconclusive. We propose a set of criteria for proper evaluation and analyze different models according to these criteria. We finally sketch future efforts to make DCCNs one step closer to the model of human vision."

DataTap lets you build data set droplets ( think of a droplet as a docker container for data ).  A droplet encapsulates a dataset that can then easily be used , imported, shared across different teams and projects.

Each Data Droplet consists for 2 items

* **Droplet Template**, similar to a docker file this specifies the dataset schema
* **Dataset annotations, metadata and media** (this is typically images / videos / rich media )

Learn more about how you can start using this here [https://github.com/zensors/datatap-python](https://github.com/zensors/datatap-python)

Many machine learning projects use proprietary data formats that require tools and utilities to be re-written from scratch to accommodate them. Not only does this slow down development substantially, but it also increases the probability that developers introduce bugs in the very code that validates models’ performance.

As part of dataTap’s efforts to allow machine learning engineers to focus only on the machine learning itself, we introduced an open-source data interchange format called Droplet. The data container format, called “annotation,” provides a standardized way to describe what is in an image. DataTap is designed to be the data platform for Software 2.0. Machine learning on reach media like images , audio or video needs a special data pipeline to version and manage data much like there are MLOps tools to version and manage models

Currently the project has common datasets available that you can download or stream with 3 lines of code.

s-lilo,MachineLearning,1620223692.0,[N] Call for Participation in a Shared Task about occupations detection in clinical texts,"Hi, everyone!

I'm a researcher from the Text Mining Unit at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, and I wanted to share with you some information about MEDDOPROF, a Shared Task that we are currently organizing focused on the detection and normalization of professions and employment status in clinical texts in Spanish.

Even if these types of entities might seem really niche, every day we learn more and more about their importance. Just think about how someone's occupation can have a radical impact in their physical and mental health, habits, lifestyle choices, ... There is even an entire medical specialty, occupational medicine, that is centered around this topic. In the context of the current pandemic, many people with specific occupations have been specially affected (for instance, health professionals and other essential workers). The detection of these terms will help researchers to better characterize health risks of specific occupations.

Outside medicine, we foresee that the systems resulting from MEDDOPROF may be used in fields such as social care, human resources, legal NLP and even gender studies. Personally, I think one of the main contributions of the task is the inclusion of employment status in a broad sense. We have annotated unemployed and retired people, family caregivers, people who are homeless, people who depend on government subsidies, etc, which strengthens the social side of this project.

Additionally, each mention in the corpus (which includes 2000 documents from over 20 different medical specialties) has been normalized to either the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations classification (ESCO) or SNOMED-CT. These are multilingual vocabularies, which we hope might inspire similar tasks in other languages (to the best of our knowledge, there haven't been any similar tasks yet).

We released the training set some weeks ago, and on June 1st we will release the test set. If you are interested in the task, want to see some annotated examples, the data or the annotation guidelines, ... please check out the task's website:[ https://temu.bsc.es/meddoprof/](https://temu.bsc.es/meddoprof/)

""

Source: [http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/belkin18a/belkin18a.pdf](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/belkin18a/belkin18a.pdf) 

What is the consensus about this question in the statistics community? Is this the equivalent of ""the big bang"" or ""how did the dinosaurs go extinct"" questions for the statistics/machine learning community? Is it fundamentally impossible to answer this question - or just extremely difficult?

My very naïve answer to this question (i.e. why do deep learning models generalize well to unseen data?) is that :

A) ""unseen"" data can apparently (on some level) be well represented by complex (e.g. non-linear) combinations of ""seen"" data : deep learning models are very good at recognizing and figuring out these complex combinations

B) ""show me your 5 closest friends and I will tell you who you are"" : on some level, data probably displays the ""nearest neighbor principle""  - in big and complex data sets, there are small ""pockets"" of homogenous data  that the model uses as stepping stones to generalize.

This of course does not explain the mathematics of why deep learning models are able to generalize to unseen data - but is this basically the essence of the matter? Deep learning models are able to generalize to unseen data because on some level, unseen data is similar to seen data. A silly and extreme example, it is unlikely that even the ""strongest"" recurrent neural networks when provided data about a certain stock from 1980-1995 would be able to predict today's weather - this is because the data too fundamentally different to allow even the best model to generalize. Or, suppose you want to use a regular statistical model to predict information about a normally distributed variable with a certain mean and standard deviation - if you drastically change the mean and standard deviation of this variable and ask the previously trained model to continue making predictions (assume the model doesn't know that anything has changed), it's natural to expect that the predictions will be less accurate. Statistical models (no matter how ""great"" they are) are able to generalize to unseen data, so long as this unseen data comes from the same ballpark as the seen data.

Am I understanding this correctly?"

universome,MachineLearning,1618499655.0,[P] Aligning Latent and Image Spaces to Connect the Unconnectable,"Hi! Wanted to share our latest project on infinite image generation: [http://universome.github.io/alis](http://universome.github.io/alis)

[The method works without any conditioning and learns from a dataset of unrelated square images](https://reddit.com/link/mrgrdn/video/53apkx1asct61/player)

Basically, it works the following way. We put each latent code at some position of the coordinates grid (where image pixels are located) and compute each pixel from an interpolation of the nearby latent codes. During training, we generate frames from random positions of this coordinates grid and feed them to the discriminator. At test time, this allows us to produce images from any position of the infinite plane which stitch seamlessly with one another.

Our generator computes an image through independent patches (like [CocoGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00284) does), which is a less extreme version of [INR-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12026)/[CIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13775), that have independence at the pixel level. This (+some technical tweaking of the coordinate embeddings) makes it (periodically) spatially equivariant: when you shift the coordinates, the output image shifts accordingly and their pixel values at common coordinates are equal (up to numerical precision), as illustrated below.

&#x200B;

[𝛿 is the value of the coordinates shift. Pixel values inside circles are equal for different generations \(up to numerical precision\)](https://preview.redd.it/4wbquwfgsct61.jpg?width=1389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8e75ffec468a79a12cdaba1b97f2280a9ebf71d)

A surprising thing is that our approach works not only on the dataset of nature landscapes (which has spatially invariant image statistics), but also (to some extent) on LSUN bedroom, which is a very ""difficult"" dataset for infinite image generation because of the walls and close-by objects. They make it hard or impossible to extrapolate an image to the left or to the right since the dataset does not have any pictures with walls or close-by objects in the middle, so the model has nowhere to learn such knowledge from.

&#x200B;

[Results on LSUN bedroom](https://preview.redd.it/ugyrknposct61.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=398e0c2b9083027c2f89645a3d5762afc6a3ac1c)

Besides, we also collected/preprocessed a high quality dataset of 90k landscape images (Landscapes HQ) from Unsplash and Flickr and will release it soon.

**Drawbacks of the approach:**

* Generating patches completely independently limits the generation quality (by \\\~30% in our experiments). Moreover, due to patchwise generation the model learnt to ignore noise injection which is a powerful tool for image editing (this also happens for INR-GAN/CIPS).
* Not all the datasets are ""connectable"". For LSUN bedroom, it worked only after we filtered away images which do not contain spatially invariant statistics (see Sec 3.3 and Appendix C). For FFHQ or ImageNet, I cannot imagine it to work at all (see the ""study"" on this in tables 3 & 4 in Appendix C)

L-MK,MachineLearning,1620290611.0,[R] Do You Even Need Attention? A Stack of Feed-Forward Layers Does Surprisingly Well on ImageNet,"TL;DR: Got scooped by MLP-Mixer, so I'm releasing my writeup/code/models. I hope someone finds them interesting/useful.

Lately I've been trying a couple variants of simple vision transformers to better understand what makes them perform well. About a month ago, I found that you could replace the attention layers with feed-forward layers and get quite good results. Last week I started a short writeup of the experiment (just a few pages, as I didn't see it as a full paper).

Today Google put out a paper (MLP-Mixer) that proposes exactly the same architecture.

When I saw the paper earlier today I considered scrapping what I had done, but now I figure that I might as well just put it out there.

For those who are interested, here's a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukemelas/do-you-even-need-attention) with pretrained models, a [W&B log](https://wandb.ai/lukemelas2/deit-experiments/reports/Do-You-Even-Need-Attention---Vmlldzo2NjUxMzI?accessToken=8kebvweue0gd1s6qiav2orco97v85glogsi8i83576j42bb1g39e59px56lkk4zu) of the experiments, and a 3-page [writeup](https://github.com/lukemelas/do-you-even-need-attention/blob/main/Do-You-Even-Need-Attention.pdf).

Also, if anyone has stories about getting scooped, feel free to share -- I'd imagine people have some crazy stories.

Edit: Wow, thank you all for the support! I really didn't expect this. Based on your suggestions, I've also uploaded a version of the report to arXiv: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02723) "

Bye-bye bugs! Say hello to enforced, clear documentation of your code.

Personally I find that I leave comments on the shape of tensors all over my code, just to keep track of what each function expects. `torchtyping` is designed to fix this.

Check out the documentation [on GitHub](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchtyping) for usage, examples, and ways to extend `torchtyping`.

Finally if you're curious, then have a look at the `torchtyping` FAQ: there's a few other libraries out there doing similar things (e.g. for JAX) so if `torchtyping` isn't quite what you're after, then you have a few other options too. :)"
Transit-Strike,MachineLearning,1616942574.0,[D] Does Dataset balance matter for a Style GAN?," When we look at classifiers, if Class 1 is dominant over Class 0. (A lot more samples) that really hurts the accuracy of our model since there is a strong bias towards one of the classes. Our model can now blindly assume that all samples are from Class 1 and it would be right very often.

With a Style GAN I am looking at, I fear I have a similar issue. I need to convert photos into fake paintings and I would say it is easy, but I have a lot more photos than painting.

Would something like that have an affect on Binary Cross Entropy? I think it would since one class is better represented. But at the same time, since the fake images are generated based on real images, we could just ensure that we generate the same number of fake images as the number of real images in the same class.

(If we have 100 paintings, generate 100 fake paintings). The number of Photos then may or may not matter. I am not sure which.

But in such a case, would a Wasserstein Loss over BCE help mitigate any issues? Since it cares about distributions and not class labels."
jj4646,MachineLearning,1619072295.0,[D] why did kernel methods become less popular than neural networks?,"I was reading today that in earlier neural networks, a popular choice of the the activation function in neural networks was the ""radial basis function"" (RBF). This is apparently why earlier neural networks were called ""kernel approximators"". This was a bit surprising to me, seeing as now most people right away assume that the popular choice of activation functions in neural networks is ReLu. It seems to me that the transition away from RBF activation functions happened around the same time that neural networks overtook SVM's in terms of popularity.

Does anyone know why this happened? I read that neural networks with the RBF function also (along with standard neural networks) have the ""universal approximation property"" - i.e., theoretically, they are able to approximate any target function to any level of accuracy (how efficiently, this is another question).  

Is there a reason that RBF's lost their popularity? Does anyone know why ReLu is the go-to activation function for neural networks these days? 

Just a guess: perhaps a neural network with ReLu activations is able to ""better"" (consistency, convergence) approximate the same target function compared to RBF, given the same ""resources"" (e.g. number of neurons and layers)?

Thanks"

Brief description :

>The main purpose of the application is to extract traffic data from vehicles on roads using aerial footage taken from static UAVs. To process the footage, deep neural network detector is used (YOLO) alongside with the OpenCV library in ordered to be executed in python. Furthermore, multiple algorithms are used, such as Kalman, Hungarian, in order to match the detections between sequential frames and extract the vehicles and their trajectories. Hence, the velocities and the moving direction of the vehicles are also calculated for each vehicle for every frame.

I don't post often at all, but I have gone through almost all of the material and resources in the Data Science Wiki, and I'm lurking around in here almost everyday, picking up little jewels of information. I have now clocked in about 800 or so dedicated hours to learning, and I am super excited about all the wild and interesting things I still don't know about. The deeper I go, the more I realize that this rabbit hole never ends. So for real and honestly, thank you guys!

Now on to my question; I am currently working on a semi large-scale Facial Recognition project with a small group. We have scraped, compiled and labeled a huge dataset of image files (aprox. 2mil images). We have them stored in a cloud database, and will train our model in batches by downloading and unzipping directly from the cloud to our notebook. I had the idea that it would be extremely time efficient if everyone in our group pulled a different batch of images, trained models on our own respective machines, and then combined our saved weights into a final model. In theory, the idea sounded good, however, after searching around google for a bit, it's not clear if this is possible, or if it's even a beneficial idea.

Looking for any input, direction towards resources, or helpful advice in general. Thanks in advance!"

However the difference is that the sub-pixel convolution can be implemented more efficiently.

Is this understanding correct? If so, why are some people (e.g. [https://github.com/atriumlts/subpixel](https://github.com/atriumlts/subpixel)) strongly recommending sub-pixel convolutions over transposed convolutions for what seem to be reasons other than just performance?"

Classic Machine Learning struggles with few-shot generalization for tasks where humans can easily generalize from just a handful of examples, for example sorting a list of numbers. Humans do this by coming up with a short program, or algorithm, that explains the few data points in a compact way. DreamCoder emulates this by using neural guided search over a language of primitives, a library, that it builds up over time. By doing this, it can iteratively construct more and more complex programs by building on its own abstractions and therefore solve more and more difficult tasks in a few-shot manner by generating very short programs that solve the few given datapoints. The resulting system can not only generalize quickly but also delivers an explainable solution to its problems in form of a modular and hierarchical learned library. Combining this with classic Deep Learning for low-level perception is a very promising future direction.

So my problem is that I was offered to solve a problem with machine learning which I am not sure that it actually is possible to do so. I could not find any literature on it. 

**So here is the background story:**

I was offered a research internship topic at my university. It would be 9 weeks full-time. From the expected level it is between a bachelor’s thesis and a master’s thesis. My supervisors do not have much knowledge about machine learning, since this is not the main focus of their work and can therefore not help me much. I have undergrad knowledge of machine learning. My main knowledge is in classical ML algorithms (SVM, kNN etc.) and DL (mainly CNNs).

However, I am not sure if this topic can be solved with machine learning and if yes then how. 

I am going to describe the goal of the internship and what they expect of me as good as possible. 

The goal is to get accurate wind velocity values for small areas/regions using machine learning. 

**Those are the things I have:**

So I have the MERA dataset which has hourly weather data, like wind velocity, pressure etc. for the entire world.The resolution of the data is 50 km times 50 km. I am going to refer to such 2500 km\^2 squares as big squares. So now one can divide Europe into such big squares. However, since the squares are very big, the accuracy of the wind velocity is not good. Therefore, I have a second dataset the Wind Atlas dataset which has a higher resolution. The squares are 3 km times 3 km. I am going to name this squares as small squares. 

So each big square can be divided into many small squares. Approximately 280 small squares fit into one big square. However, this squares do not have hourly data. They only have one wind velocity value per year. 

Additionally, I will have topological data, e.g. heights, where forests, mountains etc. lie.

**This is what I am supposed to do:**

I am somehow supposed to predict (with the help of ML) for each of this small squares which wind speed it had during some time in the past. For example, in some small square what was the wind velocity of it in May 10 2010 (optionally between 3 - 4 PM).

As a “test set“ I will only have some values from a few weather stations. Those are of course very accurate but only for a very small region. But the number of weather stations will be very small. I will have like maybe 10 weather stations for the entire Germany. Meanwhile, Germany consist of approximately 140 big squares and 40 000 small squares.  

**So my question is:**

I do not have much knowledge regarding this kind of problem. Can this actually be done with machine learning? My gut instinct is no, since it seems too utopian for me. The task seems too difficult and there is hardly any useful test data. But I would like to verify that by some of you who are way more experienced than me. 

Is this doable in general with only machine learning without any other mathematical methods? 

Can someone with my knowledge do something like that on my own in just 9 weeks? 

And if it doable, what methods, algorithms are out there?

P.S. I am sorry if the formatting is not good. I am not someone who usually posts on Reddit.

But I really need some help with that. Also I am sorry for any grammar errors since I am not a native speaker."

For my project, I am essentially trying to find a way to detect changes over time to a news narrative. At this stage I have applied an algorithm to successfully group together the stories that follow the development of the same event. So now I need to find a way to track, analyze, and maybe quantify how the events (and their coverage changes) . My current approach is using topic modeling to find important keywords in each of the articles. Then, I use those key words to map how the stories change overtime. So in the most basic of terms, I am identifying key words in the first article in each narrative chain and then comparing how those keywords change and are different from key words identified in subsequent articles about the same event. Does this approach sound reasonable? Is there anything else I should be trying instead? Thanks everyone!"

Only 1 week to go before the deadline for the 1st **Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning workshop** @ GECCO 2021, the premiere conference in evolutionary computing (this year held  virtually at Lille, France, from July 10-14, 2021)

In recent years reinforcement learning (RL) has received a lot of attention thanks to its performance and ability to address complex tasks.  At the same time evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been proven to be competitive with standard RL algorithms on certain problems, while being simpler and more scalable.

Recent advances on EA have led to the development of algorithms like Novelty Search and Quality Diversity, capable of efficiently addressing complex exploration problems and finding a wealth of different policies. All these results and developments have sparked a strong renewed interest in such population-based computational approaches.

Nevertheless, even if EAs can perform well on hard exploration problems they still suffer from low sample efficiency. This limitation is less present in RL methods, notably because of sample reuse, while on the contrary they struggle with hard exploration settings. The complementary characteristics of RL algorithms and EAs have pushed researchers to explore new approaches merging the two in order to harness their respective strengths while avoiding their shortcomings.

The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration, share perspectives, and spread best practices within our growing community at the intersection between RL and EA.

The topics at the heart of the workshop include:

* Evolutionary reinforcement learning
* Evolution strategies
* Population-based methods for policy search
* Neuroevolution
* Hard exploration and sparse reward problems
* Deceptive reward
* Novelty and diversity search methods
* Divergent search
* Sample-efficient direct policy search
* Intrinsic motivation, curiosity
* Building or designing behaviour characterizations
* Meta-learning, hierarchical learning
* Evolutionary AutoML
* Open-ended learning

Autors are invited to submit **new original work**, or **new perspectives on recently published work**  on those topics.

The accuracty is good but not excellent, so I've been trying to introduce some modifications to the architecture, tune its hyperparameters, etc.

Since the model takes so long to train (couple of days, close to a week) it is very hard to get immediate feedback on wether the changes I'm making mean anything at all or if they are just keeping things the same, or worsening them.

I notice that many SOTA models also take an extremely long time to train, so this is probably an issue many people are used to dealing with.

How do researchers typically deal with this problem? Do you have any recomendations? I first thought of extracting a subset of my dataset and training there, and hoping that the results would extrapolate to the whole thing, but it seems to me that the results don't extrapolate very well at all. Sometimes an idea that seems to work very well on the subset just doesn't introduce any  changes on the full dataset, and the reverse also happens (usually for the worse)."
DeMorrr,MachineLearning,1619215359.0,[P] TorchPQ: Efficient Nearest Neighbor Search and Clustering on GPUs,"Hi everyone!

I’m happy to introduce an open source project that I have been working for a while:

[TorchPQ](https://github.com/DeMoriarty/TorchPQ) is a python library for approximate nearest neighbor search on GPUs. It has efficient implementations of [IVFPQ](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00514462v2/document) algorithm as well as some of its variants (e.g IVFPQ+R). The project is written mostly in python using pytorch library, with some custom CUDA kernels to accelerate clustering, searching and indexing.

TorchPQ allows you to search with tens of thousands of queries in millions of vectors within a second. In some settings where high recall rate is prioritized, TorchPQ outperforms the implementation of the same algorithm in [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss). For benchmark results see the bottom part of the README page.

I’ve also spent a lot of time optimizing the k-means clustering algorithm for gpu, as a result it’s ultra fast and memory efficient. I recommend you to give it a try even if you have no interest in nearest neighbor search.

The project is still in an early stage, there could be bugs or performance issues, feel free to create an issue if you encounter any of those.

**Abstract**

In recent years, a number of prominent computer scientists, along with academics in fields such as philosophy and physics, have lent credence to the notion that machines may one day become as large as humans. Many have further argued that machines could even come to exceed human size by a significant margin. However, there are at least seven distinct arguments that preclude this outcome. We show that it is not only implausible that machines will ever exceed human size, but in fact impossible."

bendee983,MachineLearning,1617629350.0,[R] Data poisoning circumvents certified adversarial training methods,"A paper accepted at CVPR introduces a new data poisoning method that undermines ""randomized smoothing"" training techniques that make machine learning models against adversarial attacks.

Called “Poisoning Against Certified Defenses” (PACD), the method generates poisoned data that have been optimized for the target robustness techniques. The result is a dataset that reduces the average certified radius (ACR), the distance within which a trained machine learning model remains robust against adversarial perturbations. The technique was tested on GA, MACER, and SmoothAdv, three popular randomized smoothing techniques.

This is a grey-box attack: The attacker needs some knowledge of the target ML model architecture and the training method used. But they don't need access to model weights. PACD data generated for one randomized smoothing technique also transfers to other methods, though not to optimal state.

The main takeaway of the paper is that data security is an underrated aspect of adversarial attacks. While many defense techniques are focused on making model weights robust against adversarial perturbation, there's need for more efforts on detecting adversarial perturbations in training data. We also need more measures to certify the provenance of training data and protect machine learning development and deployment pipelines to prevent the compromise of training data.

We introduce a slow, explicit attention module which implements adaptive Thouless–Anderson–Palmer mean-field theory and a fast, neural one which parametrizes the so-called Onsager self-correction term. The latter module looks a lot like a transformer module. By approximating/constraining the mean-field equations, we show how a simplified update step appears which mirrors the vanilla transformer architecture, explaining the origin of feed-forward layers and the importance of residual connections.

mgalarny,MachineLearning,1619030679.0,[P] Attention Nets and More with RLlib’s Trajectory View API,"Hey Everyone,

I wanted to share two new features now stable in [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html): Support for Attention networks as custom models, and the “trajectory view API” ([RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html) is a popular reinforcement learning library that is part of the open-source [Ray project](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)).

There’s [a blog post](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/attention-nets-and-more-with-rllibs-trajectory-view-api-d326339a6e65) with code snippets about what this is, how it works, and all that, but I want to share the motivation/importance of this here as well.

# Motivation

The goal of any RL algorithm is to train the neural network, such that its action choices become optimal with respect to a reward signal, which is also provided by the environment. We often refer to our neural network function as the *policy* or π: `action = π(observation) (Eq. 1)`

In the common case above (Eq. 1), observation is the current “frame” seen by the agent, but more and more often we’re seeing RLlib users try out models where this isn’t enough. For example:

* In “frame stacking”, the model sees the last n observations to account for the fact that a single time frame does not capture the entire state of the environment (think of a ball seen in a screenshot of a game and we wouldn’t know whether it’s flying to the left or right).

https://preview.redd.it/p3kr4huknku61.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=913e0486c74bf903117a81f6043310ddc51e6627

`action = π(observations[t, t-1, t-2, ..]) (Eq. 2)`

* In recurrent neural networks (RNN), the model sees the last observation, but also a tracked hidden state or memory vector that has previously been produced by that model itself and is altered over time:  
`action, memory[t] = π(observation[t], memory[t-1]). (Eq. 3)`
* Furthermore, in attention nets (e.g. transformer models), the model sees the last observation and also the last N tracked memory vectors:  
`action, memory[t] = π(observation[t], memory[t-n:t]) (Eq. 4)`

RLlib’s **new trajectory view API** that makes these complex policy models possible (and fast). Building on that functionality, we’ll show how this enables [efficient attention net support in RLlib.](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/attention-nets-and-more-with-rllibs-trajectory-view-api-d326339a6e65)

davidbun,MachineLearning,1620139610.0,[N] Access Google Objectron (~1.92 TBs) in less than 5 seconds with Activeloop Hub,"&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/y52s5u8594x61.gif

Hi r/machinelearning,

My team at [Activeloop](https://activeloop.ai/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=objectron) partnered with Google to make Google Objectron available in under ±5 seconds (per dataset category). Google Objectron is one of Google’s most popular datasets, containing short object centric video clips with pose annotations (15000 annotated videos and 4M annotated images).

All you need to do to get started is:

Install [Hub, the open-source package](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub) that converts computer vision datasets into cloud-native NumPy-like arrays and enables a few nifty features like streaming to PyTorch and TensorFlow, dataset version-control, collaboration, etc.

`pip install hub`

And then Load the data for the bike category.

`import hub`

`bikes = hub.Dataset(""google/bike"")`

In ±5 seconds, the dataset will be available to work on (e.g. filter, apply transformations, etc.). The whole dataset ( \~1.92 TBs +metadata) would take about 33 seconds to access.

Thanks to Hub, you can visualize Google Objectron or any other computer vision dataset through our web app ([app.activeloop.ai](https://app.activeloop.ai/datasets/popular?tag=google%2Fshoe&utm_source=social&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=objectron)).

More details on using [Objectron with Hub are available in the release blogpost](https://www.activeloop.ai/blog/2021-05-03-accessing-google-objectron-data-in-less-than-5-seconds-?utm_source=social&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=objectron).

\*Please make sure that you are using latest update for hub.

https://i.redd.it/e1179xa394x61.gif

We’re working to get more datasets on the platform and improve [github.com/activeloopai/Hub](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub) as a tool. Let us know if you have any feedback - we’d like to deliver maximum value to the community.

proof_required,MachineLearning,1616753332.0,[D] How Facebook got addicted to spreading misinformation,"Behind paywall:

With new machine-learning models coming online daily, the company created a new system to track their impact and maximize user engagement. The process is still the same today. Teams train up a new machine-learning model on FBLearner, whether to change the ranking order of posts or to better catch content that violates Facebook’s community standards (its rules on what is and isn’t allowed on the platform). Then they test the new model on a small subset of Facebook’s users to measure how it changes engagement metrics, such as the number of likes, comments, and shares, says Krishna Gade, who served as the engineering manager for news feed from 2016 to 2018.

If a model reduces engagement too much, it’s discarded. Otherwise, it’s deployed and continually monitored. On Twitter, Gade explained that his engineers would get notifications every few days when metrics such as likes or comments were down. Then they’d decipher what had caused the problem and whether any models needed retraining.

But this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff. Sometimes this inflames existing political tensions. The most devastating example to date is the case of Myanmar, where viral fake news and hate speech about the Rohingya Muslim minority escalated the country’s religious conflict into a full-blown genocide. Facebook admitted in 2018, after years of downplaying its role, that it had not done enough “to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence.”

While Facebook may have been oblivious to these consequences in the beginning, it was studying them by 2016. In an internal presentation from that year, reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, a company researcher, Monica Lee, found that Facebook was not only hosting a large number of extremist groups but also promoting them to its users: “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools,” the presentation said, predominantly thanks to the models behind the “Groups You Should Join” and “Discover” features.

LSTMeow,MachineLearning,1620131082.0,[N] ClearML release: v1.0 (open source MLOPs solution),"Hi r/ml,

It has been almost two years since I first posted here about our open-source solution, and here we are again (thanks for the amazing Github star bump btw, you guys rocked!).

Today, after what seems like over 9000 person-years of working, and tinkering, long into the night, I am pleased to announce ClearML has hit version 1.0.

Following quickly after the release of ClearML 0.17.5, we added the last remaining features we felt 1.0 needed. Namely multi-model support, as well as improved batch operations.

It has been a long and sometimes bumpy path to get us to version 1.0. There have been good times and some mis-steps. Every journey is different, and we have been helped along the way by having one of the nicest slack communities you could ever wish for. 

This feels truly like a milestone. A birthday. I hope you will help us in celebrating it.

RaivoK,MachineLearning,1616590712.0,Fair Model Comparison [R],"Have not published before and need some advice. I am comparing the accuracy of different video classification models, by training each one myself in the same training environment with the same training tricks. I would like to make the comparison as fair as possible. There are a few differences between the models:

1. Each model uses a certain number of input frames. Some might use 16, some 32, and some 64.
2. Each model uses a certain spatial size. Some 114x114, others 224x224.

Now, I am not completely sure how to standardize this in my experiment. Do I train each model with the exact choices they made in their paper, or do I use the same spatial size and frame number for all models?

A reviewer might say that forcing all models to use 224x224 and 16 input frames is not fair because these values were not what some of the models were designed for.

On the other hand, if I train every model with the values that they use in their paper, some might get an advantage just from using **way** more compute.

I would like to use the same spatial size and number of frames for all of them and then compare how fast vs how accurate they are on this. Will a reviewer criticize this if I do it like this?"
ElCobo,MachineLearning,1618694910.0,[P] Wiggle-GAN: Stereoscopic camera simulation using generative adversarial neural networks,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to post my grad thesis here, in which I tried to simulate the use of a stereoscopic camera utilizing a monocular image as input. The main goal was to give a new alternative when someone wanted to create a [wigglegram](https://www.reddit.com/r/wigglegrams/), because all the ways you could achieve the effect have limitations. For example, you could use a normal camera and take many pictures with it but if the scene is moving, the effect would mimic a stop motion more than a wigglegram. On the other hand, you could use an array of cameras but that's expensive or you could use a stereoscopic camera with 3 of 4 lenses but these kinds of cameras are analogic so it takes more time to do the effect. That's the reason why we took an approach by using Neural Networks where you don't have any of these limitations.  

In this project I used a WGAN with Improved Consistency Regularization and L1 loss comparing the output and real image, you can see some the result of adjusting this values in the [github](https://github.com/RoCoBo44/Wiggle-GAN) (and the code). Also, you can see how I trained multiple some multiple solutions:

* An autoencoder (AE) which is only one net
* The Wiggle-GAN solution (two nets fighting)
* The Wiggle-GAN solution but extracting some metrics to see what it does (Wiggle-GAN no CR)

The input of the Wiggle-GAN are the images you want to move, their depth maps and the direction (left or right) and the outputs are the new images moved and their depth map estimations, so you could iterate multiple times.  If you want to try it out I made a [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N5HJ1geVM1ymLoE5C2jkLs3F_tQn-s-r?usp=sharing), but you have to download the checkpoints. 

The limitation of the net is that all are trained with images of 128x128 pixels except the last one in the colab that is 256x256. The code automatically changes the scale of your image to the size it needs so you don't have to change it manually.

Sometimes it doesn't generate the wiggle expected and that may be due to the depth map estimation. If that happens you could download the depth map image in the folder (/Image/Input - Test/) with the name ""{number}\_d.png"", then with an editing software you could change it and uploaded it with the same name in the same place.

If you want to try it and you have some problems with that, feel free to ask me for anything.

Lots of love"

chasep255,MachineLearning,1617966989.0,[D] Loss function for audio auto encoder.,"Trying to build an auto encoder for raw audio data (time domain.)  I did this once before a while back and never got a good result.  I tried using mean squared error loss and the output really only captured a muted version of the low frequency signals.  I also tried computing the mean squared error of the fft of the output but that did not do much better.  

Now I am trying to combine WGAN-GP with some sort of other loss function.  I did this same approach last week with images where I combined a WGAN and VGG19 perceptual loss.  This produced really sharp images.  However I don't have any sort of pretrained models for raw audio (I supposed I could make one.)  So I am trying to combine the FFT loss with WGAN.  I just kicked off training and have not seen the result yet, however, I am worried that the FFT loss will prevent the model from learning the higher frequency signals since there will be a larger penalty for guessing something that sounds realistic but is say 180 degrees out of phase.  Does anyone know of a better loss function I could try for sound data?  Right now my fft loss is defined as ...

fft\_loss = tf.reduce\_mean(tf.square(tf.abs(tf.signal.stft(g, 64, 32) - tf.signal.stft(r, 64, 32))))"

However, I stand in awe and think of how the same community is gate-keeping research  for other groups of the same community. The same community (who organizes **International** academic conferences) asks ""high"" fees based on a **national life standards** to researchers from the Global South. ""high""  is relative to the life standards of some countries.

It is hard to forge a path without being included.

prestodigitarium,MachineLearning,1617931758.0,"[P] Gourdian Free Dataset Download: EPA Air Quality System Daily CO, NO2, O3, SO2 Concentrations since 1980","Howdy!

We've just added another few free dataset downloads to our project (Gourdian), this time from the EPA Air Quality System, daily levels of the following pollutants from measuring stations throughout the US, going back to 1980:

* Carbon Monoxide (CO): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.co_daily_summary
* Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.no2_daily_summary
* Ozone (O3): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.ozone_daily_summary
* Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): https://gourdian.net/g/eric/epa_aqs.so2_daily_summary

This dataset is only updated twice per year.

Why should you care about these things? Well, they're pretty nasty pollutants, which frequently affect human health, especially over long exposure periods. Perhaps concentrations should affect where we build homes more than they do, for example? They're also useful proxies for various types of human activity.

**Carbon monoxide** can be deadly in high concentrations, as it binds to hemoglobin, and makes it so that one's blood can't carry as much oxygen. Created via combustion of fossil fuels.

**Nitrogen dioxide** is one of the results of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion, is one of the precursors for other harmful pollutants such as ozone and particulates, and plays a role in the formation of acid rain (it becomes nitric acid). It's also generally correlated with exposure to other byproducts of road traffic, many of which have been linked to respiratory illnesses and systemic inflammation, which can lead to a whole host of other health issues.

**Ozone** is a powerful oxidant, which makes it so that it can cause damage to respiratory tissues. It also attacks various polymers like rubber, eventually causing it to crack. It's formed primarily from photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (like NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). High concentrations aren't limited to urban areas, however, and it can travel hundreds of miles downwind from the source.

Finally, **sulfur dioxide**. Formed largely by the combustion of fossil fuels with high levels of sulfur, as well as volcanic activity. It's a precursor to acid rain (it becomes sulfuric acid). Sulfur dioxide is known to be at least mildly toxic, and can be hazardous in high concentrations. Long term exposure to low concentrations can also be problematic. The amount of sulfur in fossil fuels vary widely by type - automotive gasoline has much less than bunker fuel commonly used by container ships, for example.

If you'd like to download any part of these, you can filter down to the parts you care part via the lat/long filter (button on the map to select area) or by year, via sliders. As you do this, the download size noted on the download button in the upper right should change. When you've got the part you want, click download, and you should get a CSV.

A bit about our goals and what we're trying to build:

* Filter (optional), click the button, CSV arrives on your hard drive
* Downloads are always a single CSV, no bundles with weird directory structures, no other formats
* CSVs are indexed and filterable by a few column types (lat/long and date/time at the moment), so you can download just the parts you want
* Open licensed datasets are free to download
* No signup required for downloading open datasets
* Search within and across datasets

chimp73,MachineLearning,1620077927.0,[D] An RL agent based on a large NN that one-shot learns in single SGD updates. Recall and planning through generalization from one-shot learned predictions and policy updates,"[Yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/n2ts0l/d_how_far_can_we_get_with_oneshot_learning/), I explored the consequences if the scaling hypothesis were true, in particular what if upscaling gives us one-shot learning in single SDG updates as well as (super)human-level inference, prediction and generalization abilities.

Today, I've been thinking how a concrete implementation of this approach could look like. Ideas are cheap, but here it goes:

The model I've come up with is simply a fully-connected, wide VAE that at each step performs one inference and then produces two Gaussian samples and two predictions based on the samples. The first sample is used to predict the future, and the second sample is used to predict its own prediction (based on the first sample). As a consequence, the model would one-shot learn both the thought and sensory experience to have occurred.

Let x\_t be an N x T tensor containing T time steps (say 2 seconds sampled at about 10 Hz) of N = S + P + 1 features, where S is the length of the sensor vector s, P is the number of motor neurons p (muscle contractions between 0 and 1, i.e. sigmoidal) and one extra dimension for the experienced reward r. Let the first prediction be x'\_t = VAE(concat(x\_{t-1}, x''\_{t-1})) and the second prediction x''_t corresponding to the second sample from the VAE produced in the same way. Then, minimize the loss by SGD: (x_t - x'_t)^2 + (x'_t - x''_t)^2 + KLD(z') + KLD(z'') + p'_t(p'_t - α∙r_t)^2 + p''_t(p''_t - α∙r''_t)^2 + λ||p'_t||_1, where KLD is the KL regularizer for each Gaussian sample, α is a scaling constant for the reward such that strong absolute reward is > 1 and ||p'_t||_1 is a sparsity prior on the policy to encourage competition between actions. The two RL losses simply punish/reinforce actions that coincide with reward (though a slight temporal delay would likely help). The second loss acts on the imagined policy and imagined reward.

I'm unsure the thoughts can actually become goal-directed this way and I'd be extremely surprised if this actually works, but it is fun to think about."

\[[1-Min Presentation Video](https://crossminds.ai/video/predicting-multiple-sclerosis-from-gait-dynamics-using-an-instrumented-treadmill-a-machine-learning-approach-60626a18eb4e66fab2491414/)\] \[[Paper Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9311191)\] 

**Abstract:** Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurological conditions worldwide whose prevalence is now greatest among people 50-60 years of age. While clinical presentations of MS are highly heterogeneous, mobility limitations is one of the most frequent symptoms. The aims of this study were to examine MS and disability related changes in spatiotemporal and kinetic gait features after normalization; and evaluate the effectiveness of a gait data-based machine learning (ML) framework for MS prediction (GML4MS). Methods: In this study, gait data during self-paced walking on an instrumented treadmill from 20 persons with MS and 20 age, weight, height and gender-matched healthy older adults (HOA) were obtained. We explored two normalization strategies, namely size-N (standard body size-based normalization) and regress-N (regression-based normalization using scaling factors derived by regressing gait features on multiple subject demographics) to minimize the dependency of derived gait features on the subject demographics; and proposed GML4MS, a ML based methodology to classify individual strides of older persons with MS (PwMS) from healthy controls, so as to generalize across different walking tasks and subjects after gait normalization. Results: We observed that regress-N improved the accuracy of identifying pathological gait using ML when compared to size-N. When generalizing from comfortable walking to walking while talking, gradient boosting machine achieved the optimal subject classification accuracy and AUC of 94.3% and 1.0, respectively and for subject generalization, a multilayer perceptron resulted in the best accuracy and AUC of 80% and 0.86, respectively, both with regress-N normalized data. Conclusion: The integration of gait data and ML to predict MS may provide a viable patient-centric approach to aid clinicians in disease monitoring and relapse treatment. This work is the first attempt to employ and demonstrate the potential of ML for this domain. Significance: The results of this study have future implications for the way regression normalized gait features may be clinically used to design ML-based disease prediction strategies and monitor disease progression in PwMS.

fripperML,MachineLearning,1617772778.0,[D] Is it always recommended to scale features to be predicted the same way as the training data was scaled?,"I don't know if this has been asked before... And the question might seem somewhat silly, so let me start briefly with the standard approach:

* The general advice I have always seen is that, if you decide to scale your data (which, in general, is recommended), you should fit\_transform a scaler during the training process and then apply the same scaler to the data to be predicted.
* This makes a lot of sense, and allows the model to predict from one only sample to whatever number of samples.

I am not questioning that. But I have the feeling that sometimes it is not the best approach. Let me give you an example:

* Let's suppose that we are dealing with a model that predicts probability of default of a person using economic features, like the annual income, amount of debts, etc.
* Let's suppose that the only preprocessing we make is scaling of the data.
* Let's suppose that we trained the model with data from 2018 and we are still using this model in production.

In this setting, it is very likely that there is some kind of drift, worsening the performance, and so one could retrain the model using more recent data. But my intuition is that, at least partially, one could reduce the problem by scaling the features of the instances to be predicted using the information of the year in course. I think so because those kind of economic features are all affected by inflation, so, for example, an annual income of 80K in 2018 is comparable to an annual income of, say, 85K in the present year, and scaling with a ""moving ruler"" can be better than scaling with a ""fixed ruler"".

This approach could be useful whenever the feature has a mean that changes in time. What do you think? Do you think it does make sense?

Of course, one limitation is that it is not easy to implement (the only way I can think of is when you use your model to make batch predictions for big enough chunks, so that scaling the features according to the distribution of those chunks is meaningful)."

I created a small (minimalistic design ) webapp for Machine Learning feeds, papers and events and this webapp literally has **Feeds**, **Events** and **Papers** section.

Here is the link: [https://mloverflow.com](https://mloverflow.com/) (I am currently adding contents, but having more people engaged on it would be delightful)

Let's check the features of our webapp if you could spare a moment:

**Feeds** is where you share your medium articles or anything that you find interesting over internet related to ML/AI. May it be linkedin posts about ML/DL. Even reddit link about your project you did related to AI/ML. You made an impression detection app and uploaded in youtube? How about sharing it on this website? Any medium blogs you wrote after reading a paper? Share the **link**.

**Events** is where you share **link** of events related to ML/AI.

**Papers** is where we discuss research papers. People can comment different blogs/videos **links** which will be useful for other users to come.

**COMMENT SECTION:**

We do have comment section for Feeds and Papers, so it would be easier for people to post related ML/DL posts.

There'll be 4 types of comments. **Audio, Video, Text, Explain**.

Audio, Video,Text will contain links of websites that will have audio, video or blog post respectively. The **links** not the actual video/audio. **Explain** is where you clarify/write about things there in comment section where you don't need help with links.

**MOTIVATION:**

What's the point of creating a site when we already have [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) subreddit, Medium for article sharing and of course when we can google search?

I believe this will make navigation for things easier and having a central place for ML/DL related posts would make it convenient for people interested in ML/DL to further consolidate their understanding.

**Miscellaneous**:

I am not really a great developer, but I think it might help few enthusiasts out there as I am one of them.

Note: *There is no option for uploading audio/video/gifs/image as of now as I don't see a point of it. But if we need it in future, I would be happy to add them as well.*

Increasingly we use machine learning to build interactive systems that learn from past actions and the reward obtained. Theory suggests several possible approaches, such as contextual bandits, reinforcement learning, the do-calculus, or plain old Bayesian decision theory. What are the most theoretically appropriate and practical approaches to doing causal inference for interactive systems?

We are particularly interested in case studies of applying machine learning methods to interactive systems that *did* or *did* *not* use Bayesian or *likelihood* based methods, with a discussion about why this choice was made in terms of practical or theoretical arguments. We also welcome submissions in the following areas:

* Offline evaluation of recommender and interactive systems.
* Comparison of Bayesian, off-policy and other heuristic approaches for offline metrics.
* Probabilistic approaches applied to contextual bandits and reinforcement learning approaches.
* Probabilistic approaches to incrementality and attribution.
* Non-Bayesian approaches and trade-offs with Bayesian/Likelihood approaches.
* Bayesian methods in a production environment.

I can imagine that a dedicated loss function based on somehow minimizing the area between a predicted and a ground truth curve would work best, but I'm running into the issue that it's difficult to determine the points that define each of the line segments, aka how many points should one predict, and where should they be placed best?

It talks to a human and the responses from *both* parties are used for further training. (In batches, paired together with symbols to indicate who is saying what)**

This would be quite computationally expensive obviously but suppose I've got the hardware and a lot of time and patience. Suppose I have daily conversations with the system, and the input/output of every interaction is immediately fed back in as training. (And we set the learning rate higher than normal because strong fitting would actually be good in this case)

Since natural conversation with a single person would take a long time to generate an appreciable volume of text, I was thinking maybe there'd also be ""introspective"" periods of training where it generates both sides of the conversation by itself, pretending there's still a human participant.

We could even add a simple ""judgement"" pass where the weight of fine-tuning for the AI's output is adjusted depending on how the human responds.

He thinks that if you bet on computers and software in 1990 you would have been as right as if you bet on AI now. But he thinks that we have been programming computers the same way since the 1950s and there has been a huge stagnation ever since. Mathematics is the process of taking a fuzzy thought and formalising it. But could we automate that? Could we create a system which will act like a super human mathematician but you can talk to it in natural language? This is what Christian calls autoformalisation. Christian thinks that automating many of the things we do in mathematics is the first step towards software synthesis and building human-level AGI. Mathematics ability is the litmus test for general reasoning ability. Christian has a fascinating take on transformers too.

hnipun,MachineLearning,1617549237.0,[P][D] Dynamic Hyper-parameters,"*Hyper-parameters control the learning process of models. They are set before training starts, either by intuition or a hyper-parameter search. They either stay static or change based on a pre-determined schedule. We are introducing dynamic hyper-parameters which can be manually adjusted during the training based on model training stats.*

**Github:** [**https://github.com/lab-ml/labml**](https://github.com/lab-ml/labml) **App:** [**https://app.labml.ai/**](https://app.labml.ai/)

## What are hyper-parameters?

Hyper-parameters are parameters that control the learning process of models, such as the learning rate, batch size, and weight decay. The model might not learn if the hyper-parameters are not set correctly. Setting hyper-parameters is a key part of deep learning research. Researchers find them based on intuition or by running a hyper-parameter search. In a hyper-parameter search, the model is trained repeatedly with different hyper-parameters to find the best set of hyper-parameters. Hyper-parameter search becomes costly as the number of hyper-parameters increases and the model training time increases.

Some hyper-parameters change during the training based on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you could slowly decrease the learning rate, or you could decrease the coefficient of an auxiliary loss as the model learns. Finding these schedules is nearly impossible with a hyper-parameter search, and are usually determined based on the intuition of the researchers.

## Why is it hard to determine hyper-parameters?

Setting hyper-parameters require quite a bit of experience with the kind of models and sizes you are training as well as the dataset. For instance, consider fine-tuning a pre-trained language model to classify tweets. You get a pre-trained language model as the backbone and attach a layer (or two) as the classification head. First, you freeze the parameters of the backbone and train the head for a certain number of updates, and then you unfreeze all parameters and train all the parameters. The number of steps to keep the backbone frozen is generally set to 1 epoch. This is a hyper-parameter. And the common practice of freezing for 1 epoch might be too small or too large depending on the size of the model as well as the dataset size. Someone who has worked with similar models and datasets will have a good intuition on this hyper-parameter. If you are new, you will have to try training the model to get a feel about it.

## ⚙️ Introducing Dynamic Hyper-parameters

Dynamic hyper-parameters are hyper-parameters that researchers can adjust while the model is being trained. This allows researchers to actively control how the model trains, instead of letting the model train with a pre-determined set of hyper-parameters. Dynamic hyper-parameters help train the model faster and better on a single training session. Also, they let researchers play around with the hyper-parameters during a single training run to gather insights.

Sometimes researchers save the model checkpoints and restart the training with changed hyper-parameter values. This has a similar effect to dynamic hyper-parameters but it's quite cumbersome to do.

## How does it work?

You need to create a dynamic hyper-parameter and register them along with other configurations.

    from labml import experiment
    from labml.configs import FloatDynamicHyperParam
    
    lr = FloatDynamicHyperParam(2.5e-4, range_=(0, 0.1))
    
    experiment.configs({
      'learning_rate': lr,
      ...,
    })

Then can call the dynamic hyper-parameter to get the current value. For example:

    def train(batch):
      optimizer.set_lr(lr())
      optimizer.step()

The call `lr()` will return the current learning rate set in [labml.ai](https://labml.ai) [app](https://github.com/lab-ml/app).

[*This*](https://github.com/lab-ml/labml/raw/master/guides/dynamic_hp.png) *is a screenshot of the mobile web interface for changing dynamic hyper-parameters. In this* [*Demo*](https://app.labml.ai/run/6eff28a0910e11eb9b008db315936e2f/hyper_params) *demo we adjusted the learning rate, clipping range, and the number of training epochs (per sample) to speed up the training of a* [*PPO agent*](https://nn.labml.ai/rl/ppo/experiment.html) *for Atari Breakout. A standard learning rate decay and other static hyper-parameter values would have taken a lot of training updates to get over the score of 1.*

## Example use-cases

**Freezing pre-trained layers**: When fine-tuning a language model, you can train with the backbone frozen until the rate of improvement of loss drops, and change the hyper-parameter affecting which layers are frozen. This is better and faster than going with the common practice of keeping the backbone frozen for 1 epoch for all models and datasets.

**Learning-rate warm-up and decay**: The learning rate can be manually increased during the initial training updates. You could decide how long to warm up for based on the loss curves. Similarly, you can decay the learning rate when the loss values stabilize. This allows you to use higher learning rates initially to speed up the training.

**Increase sequence length**: Recurrent models train faster when the BPTT length is shorter. But you need higher BPTT lengths to improve accuracy. Therefore, it is a common practice to start with a shorter BPTT length and increase it later. Again deciding when to do this beforehand is hard. Changing this dynamically is a lot easier.

**Adjusting regularization parameters**: You can start with lower weight decay and lower dropout probabilities initially. Especially if you are not sure about the representation capacity of the model. You can then increase these regularization parameters later when the validation loss stops improving (higher variance).

**Adjusting reinforcement learning hyper-parameters**: Reinforcement learning tends to have more hyper-parameters. Most of which need to change during training, such as discount factor, entropy-bonus coefficients, learning-rate, etc.  Pre-determining them is almost impossible without observing a few training runs, and those training runs go many hours or days even for simple gaming environments. Changing these during training based on the agent's performance and other stats is a lot easier.

## What's next

**Updating hyper-parameter schedules**: Our current implementation only allows users to update hyper-parameter values. This can take too much user time. For instance, let's say based on current loss curves the user figures out that he wants to drop the learning rate from `1e-3` to `2.5e-4` during the next 100,000 updates. With our current implementation, she would have to make several manual  changes. We want to let users set and update hyper-parameter schedules so that user has to manually intervene only when necessary.

**Rewind**: Often when training with dynamic hyper-parameters you feel like experimenting with them. Sort of like a small hyper-parameter search while the model is training. But when things go wrong you want to reset. To enable this we are working on a simple rewind (or undo) option, where the user could restart at  any checkpoint, with a couple of taps on the screen."

Background: I am a solo-ing data scientist (MSc in data science but no actual ML work experience so I haven't seen precedents) trying to get ML up and running at a large (15,000 person) firm. I came up with a good idea to weave in ML with a traditional service that the firm provides, but now I need to figure out how actually do the thing. I've done a proof of concept with some toy data and it gave promising results.

Could the end-to-end product be done within Azure? Is there a cheaper option since the ML model would only need to be updated annually? My company has difficulty funding innovations that are not tied directly to a client project, so I essentially have no budget until I get a client buy-in.

What other team members would it make sense to bring on? Should I outsource any part of this to an external company? I can handle the model building, but I have no idea what happens after I make an API to broadcast the predictions. There is a company lawyer that oversees the country's GDPR compliance (so not too sure how much free time he has). Also, I currently work closely with a developer-ish person who was involved in creating a web app, but not too sure how much technical knowledge he has. Whenever I press him for details he seems to have no clue (for example, he had never heard of Azure before I mentioned it. He said something about using GitHub for the web app.)."

RchGrav,MachineLearning,1618790215.0,[D] I made a script that does all the work to deploy GPT-NEO on Windows 10. (Please Test),"Envisioned Purpose: Windows 10 GPT-NEO Local Demo for the Average Joe.

[https://gist.github.com/RchGrav/8bb3769a825540a4587e73ce6ea26053/](https://gist.github.com/RchGrav/8bb3769a825540a4587e73ce6ea26053/)

So what this does is deploy miniconda3 and configures the base environment which then downloads and runs one of the GPT-NEO models on either a CPU or CUDA capable device (GPU w/ CUDA installed).  I chose miniconda3 because the concept behind this was to allow someone to run GPT-NEO locally for experimentation or a foundation as a base environment.   If this doesn't work for you please report back with some details.  This is a private GIST at the moment but I may put it on my Github page if people say this would be a benefit to anyone who only has a Windows system and is struggling to get a working system going.   I'm only starting off on my journey of actually working with machine learning hands on, but I have been doing deploy scripts for years in the IT field.

Some technical notes:  The script installs and uses the choco command (modeled after apt on linux) from [chocolately.org](https://chocolately.org) to bootstrap miniconda3, it uses the echo to generate a few other supporting scripts for requesting elevation and to reload the path and environment variables so that its a one step process..  run the script.  Finally the script also creates a example python file that executes to text generating text, but also a condition for the main script so if it is run again it won't try redeploying everything, it just drops to the GPT-NEO demo.

There is some notes at the bottom of the Gist which will be helpful for anyone looking to run on a GPU, or use the larger transformer model.

Minimum Recommended Specs: Tons of Cores, 16GB of or more..   Fast storage (NVMe / SSD) suggested, 12GB of HDD space for the smaller model, 2x that for the bigger model, and 3x that for both.)

To run on GPU: I don't know..  I have a GeForce RTX 3090, so that works for sure.. you will need to install CUDA from NVidia, this much I do know.

Side Note: Personally, I was hoping to get GPT-NEO up and working on a Jetson Nano board, but even with swap I think its going to be a really tight fit.. sounds like its gonna cost me more than $100 if I wanna pretend to be Michael Knight and converse with my car.  :-P

Please share feedback..  This may help others who are looking for a quick and easy bootstrap and way to play with GPT Text Generation.  It shouldn't mess with Anaconda at all since miniconda3 runs in its own environment, so as far as I can surmise I can't see it messing up anything on your system.."

I've been studying ML for about 6 months now with pretty steady progress, and just started getting into neural networks. My background is in neurobiology/cognitive neurosciences, so the fundamental principles behind DLNN model architecture and behavior are already familiar. Deep learning is much more statistics oriented than neuroscience given the nature of modeling and the ease of access to quantitative data, but I'm actually surprised how little biological systems are discussed/referenced, especially given how much we know about the various mechanisms for modulating learning.

&#x200B;

Abstract

Jellyfish nerve nets provide insight into the origins of nervous systems, as both their taxonomic position and their evolutionary age imply that jellyfish resemble some of the earliest neuron-bearing, actively-swimming animals. Here, we develop the first neuronal network model for the nerve nets of jellyfish. Specifically, we focus on the moon jelly Aurelia aurita and the control of its energy-efficient swimming motion. The proposed single neuron model disentangles the contributions of different currents to a spike. The network model identifies factors ensuring non-pathological activity and suggests an optimization for the transmission of signals. After modeling the jellyfish’s muscle system and its bell in a hydrodynamic environment, we explore the swimming elicited by neural activity. We find that different delays between nerve net activations lead to well-controlled, differently directed movements. Our model bridges the scales from single neurons to behavior, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of jellyfish neural control of locomotion.

Authors: Norman Makoto Su, David J. Crandall

Abstract: The success of deep learning has led to intense growth and interest in computer vision, along with concerns about its potential impact on society. Yet we know little about how these changes have affected the people that research and practice computer vision: we as a community spend so much effort trying to replicate the abilities of humans, but so little time considering the impact of this work on ourselves. In this paper, we report on a study in which we asked computer vision researchers and practitioners to write stories about emotionally-salient events that happened to them. Our analysis of over 50 responses found tremendous affective (emotional) strain in the computer vision community. While many describe excitement and success, we found strikingly frequent feelings of isolation, cynicism, apathy, and exasperation over the state of the field. This is especially true among people who do not share the unbridled enthusiasm for normative standards for computer vision research and who do not see themselves as part of the “incrowd.” Our findings suggest that these feelings are closely tied to the kinds of research and professional practices now expected in computer vision. We argue that as a community with significant stature, we need to work towards an inclusive culture that makes transparent and addresses the real emotional toil of its members."

This  release is packed with many new features and optimizations under the  hood. An entire overview of what's new can be found in our CHANGELOG ([https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/releases/tag/0.2.0](https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/releases/tag/0.2.0)). An overview of some major updates:

&#x200B;

**0) What is RDF2Vec?**

RDF2Vec is a technique to generate embeddings for nodes or entities in a Knowledge Graph (often represented in RDF format, hence the name).

The technique is unsupervised and therefore task-agnostic. You can generate embeddings for nodes and use those for multiple downstream tasks.

A concrete example is a graph containing information on chemical compounds, an example snippet of this data:

`<Compound rdf:about=""#d193"">`

`<cytogen_sce rdf:datatype=""&xsd;boolean"">true</cytogen_sce>`

`<hasAtom rdf:resource=""#d193\_13""/>`

`<mouse_lymph rdf:datatype=""&xsd;boolean"">false</mouse_lymph>`

`<amesTestPositive rdf:datatype=""\&xsd;boolean"">false</amesTestPositive>`

`<hasAtom rdf:resource=""#d193\_10""/>`

`<hasBond rdf:resource=""#bond3301""/>`

`<hasBond rdf:resource=""#bond3299""/>`

`<hasBond rdf:resource=""#bond3308""/>`

`<hasAtom rdf:resource=""#d193\_3""/>`

`<hasBond rdf:resource=""#bond3305""/>`

`<hasAtom rdf:resource=""#d193\_12""/>`

`<hasAtom rdf:resource=""#d193\_8""/>`

`<hasBond rdf:resource=""#bond3311""/>`

`<cytogen_ca rdf:datatype=""&xsd;boolean"">false</cytogen_ca>`

`</Compound>`

Which can then be turned into numerical representations through RDF2Vec:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**1) Rudimentary Literal Support**In  addition to node embeddings, pyRDF2Vec can extract numerical  information from the neighbourhood around a node. Users can specify a  path of predicates that can be followed to obtain numerical information.

**2) Online Learning**Originally,  the entire model had to be re-trained when the underlying knowledge  graph changed. This is no longer the case, pyRDF2Vec 0.2.0 now features  online learning to update your embedding model dynamically.

https://preview.redd.it/5wasofiy2ko61.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d97a0e84a1df78b37f8a3e9fb223a8eb92f4c7d

**3) Reverse Walking**The  original walking algorithm extracted children starting from a certain  root recursively. In pyRDF2Vec 0.2.0, parents can be extracted as well.  This enables better interaction with the underlying windowing used by  Word2Vec.

https://preview.redd.it/rijl8pdz2ko61.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=427c6d5b9bfed1b1552f822ec239935f3dee789c

**4) Blazing Fast Walking**Many optimizations have  been made under the hood to speed up the walk extraction. Optimizations  include: multiprocessing, caching, asynchronous operations, etc...  Speedups of an order of magnitude can easily be achieved!

Inspired by the fact that biological creatures attend to multiple modalities at the same time, DeepMind releases its new Perceiver model. Based on the Transformer architecture, the Perceiver makes no assumptions on the modality of the input data and also solves the long-standing quadratic bottleneck problem. This is achieved by having a latent low-dimensional Transformer, where the input data is fed multiple times via cross-attention. The Perceiver's weights can also be shared across layers, making it very similar to an RNN. Perceivers achieve competitive performance on ImageNet and state-of-the-art on other modalities, all while making no architectural adjustments to input data.

I'm currently in a situation where my batch size basically cannot exceed 2. If I had a cluster, I'd be able to do much better than that, but I don't, so I can't. This, I think, is leading to stability issues, because if the phenomena that the model is taking as input are homogeneous in a given step, the model will simply try and optimize towards giving the appropriate output generally, rather than conditionally.

What should I be trying to do? Should I be bumping up the betas in the Adam optimizer? Holding onto gradients over multiple batches and then applying them all at once? Any ideas?"
yashchandak,MachineLearning,1619781819.0,[R] Universal Off-Policy Evaluation,"Hi everyone,

I am happy to share with you our first steps towards a universal off-policy estimator (UnO) --- one that provides off-policy estimates and high-confidence bounds for any parameter of the return distribution. 

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12820](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12820)

(joint work with Scott Niekum, Bruno Silva, Erik Learned-Miller, Emma Brunskill, and Phil Thomas)

We use UnO for estimating and simultaneously bounding the mean, variance, quantiles/median, inter-quantile range, CVaR, and the entire cumulative distribution of returns in the off-policy (or counterfactual) setting. We also discuss Uno's applicability in various settings, including fully observable, partially observable (i.e., with unobserved confounders), Markovian, non-Markovian, stationary, smoothly non-stationary, and discrete distribution shifts.

UnO can be useful in many critical applications that require thinking about metrics beyond the expected return. For example, medical settings (where tail-sensitive risk measures like value-at-risk/CVaR are essential to avoid catastrophic outcomes), online recommendation (where metrics like median/inter-quantiles are essential to tackle high noise in data collection), or human-machine interaction (where metrics like variance/entropy are essential to quantify uncertainty in the system's outcomes).

We believe that we have barely scratched the surface of this direction, and we welcome any and all feedback!"

AhmedAl93,MachineLearning,1617316167.0,[D][R] Solutions for handwritten text generation,"Hello,
The aim of my post is to discuss the possible solutions for synthetic handwritten text generation under specific constraints.

Context: Currently working as a data scientist in a french company, I encountered some issues when dealing with handwritten text recognition, mainly because the amount of available data is simply not enough (~4k images of handwritten text)

The first idea that came to my mind is to generate a large ""artificial"" handwritten text dataset by assembling single handwritten characters (check out Chars74k dataset), so I made a script that takes a string as input, assembles character images and provides an image containing handwritten text.

This strategy gave really promising results: I trained a text recognition model (called ""deep text recognition benchmark"") on the artificial dataset (120k images) then finetuned it on my real dataset and got 72% accuracy.

However, even if this result is good, it can be improved mainly by generating handwritten text that is as similar to the real one as possible.

I was thinking about using GAN models, but the problem is that they need what I'm lacking in the first place: big amount of data.

Do you have any ideas about solving this ""dilemma"" ?
Also, I thought this dilemma can be seen as PhD thesis proposal, and I'm planning to discuss with my managers about it, so if you can share your views on this, it would be great !"

There will be multiple amount, date, free text and categorical fields and there will be relationships between those fields.

We have a manual mapping and transformation defined for each incoming file, but the volume of different formats and sources is ever increasing. Im looking for a way to take any input file and to train a model that predicts for each column what the most likely corresponding column in the target file is.

I've been looking into a few things : using NLP\spacy to train a model that recognises patterns in the column data. E.g. Numeric + period + comma is likely to correspond to amount. I've also looked at modeling the data and extracting an RDF representation using a open source tool called Karma to see if I can train a model on a network graph. But really struggling to see how to implement this. Regex would only get us part of the way there and I'm really trying to see if there is a scalable way to implement this. 

Is anyone aware of the formal name of this type of problem and if there are tried and tested approaches\implementations out there that I could build upon?"

Abstract: Most statistical classifiers are designed to find patterns in data where numbers fit into rows and columns, like in a spreadsheet, but many kinds of data do not conform to this structure. To uncover patterns in non-conforming data, we describe an approach for modifying established statistical classifiers to handle non-conforming data, which we call dynamic kernel matching (DKM). As examples of non-conforming data, we consider (i) a dataset of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences labelled by disease antigen and (ii) a dataset of sequenced TCR repertoires labelled by patient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, anticipating that both datasets contain signatures for diagnosing disease. We successfully fit statistical classifiers augmented with DKM to both datasets and report the performance on holdout data using standard metrics and metrics allowing for indeterminant diagnoses. Finally, we identify the patterns used by our statistical classifiers to generate predictions and show that these patterns agree with observations from experimental studies."

In statistical learning theory, there is something called the VC Dimension of an algorithm (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension) - the VC dimension is apparently what describes the relartive level of complexity a machine learning algorithm can capture. Does this concept of VC Dimension carry over to models in time series analysis? Is it possible to show that LSTM's have a higher VC dimension compared to ARIMA style models? Supposedly, neural network based time series models were developed because modeols like ARIMA was unable to provide reliable estimates for bigger and complex datasets. Mathematically speaking, what allows a LSTM to capture more variation and complexity in a dataset compared to ARIMA?




2) Lately, I have seen many people starting to suggest that Convoloution Neural Networks (CNN) can also be used for the purpose of time series forecasting. Just as a general question: in what instances would it be better to use a CNN for time series forecasting compared to an LSTM?

At first glance, this seems impossible, since basically neural net is a deterministic non-linear function.

As for the VAE, the encoder of VAE takes such x as an input and results in the main parameters of distribution(mostly, mean and covariance of gaussian distribution). This seems plausible; just by adding some random variable epsilion \~ N(0, I) you can construct Normal distribution.

But for Decoder, though many literature assumes the decoder has the form of probability distribution(which is P(X|Z)), yet they don't. Unlike the encoder part, there is no *randomness* in the structure of VAE decoder.

Moreover many decoder of the VAE assumes that they have normal distribution, but how could they be so sure?

**A cloud-based Text Annotator built for Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists.**

We have been working on otso Annotator for over two years. It began as an internal tool, used to manage annotation and data labelling for our own machine learning projects. As the tool and the interface developed, we began providing it to select enterprise customers. We’ve received so much significant positive feedback from our clients, that we decided to launch the Annotator as a standalone product.

otso Annotator provides three key benefits; the user experience, which prioritises ease-of-use and understanding. The project management features, which let you allocate and manage annotation tasks. Finally, as a cloud-first tool, you no longer need to have annotators use a CLI to get started, which makes it a much easier tool for teams to use.

**Why a focus on the user experience of teams?**

Text annotation is best done in a team environment. Ideally, machine learning engineers and data scientists will set up and run projects, while subject matter experts provide annotations. We have built otso Annotator with these different user types in mind - enabling seamless project setup for project admins and an easy and keyboard enabled annotation experience for annotators.

With this public launch, we are granting users and teams that sign up during April an extended trial period of 30 days.

artificial_intelect,MachineLearning,1616542211.0,[D] PipeMare paper discussion,"or maybe PipeMare paper rant...

&#x200B;

A while back I read a paper on mitigating the effects of asynchronous pipelined training called [PipeMare](https://proceedings.mlsys.org/paper/2021/hash/6c8349cc7260ae62e3b1396831a8398f-Abstract.html). Their methods didn't seem novel or super helpful so I ignored the paper and that was that. Then I noticed that it was accepted into a conference: MLSys2021.

So now I guess it's worth putting my thoughts online.

PipeMare proposes two methods to mitigate asynchronous pipelined NN training.

Issue 1: the type of asynchronous pipelined NN training they mitigate for is Pipelined Backpropagation (Petrowski et al., 1993). Petrowski et al. (1993) aren't even cited in the paper. Just because PipeDream doesn't cite Petrowski et al. (1993) does not mean you shouldn't. Note Pipelined Backpropagation has 2 issues: inconsistent weight & delayed gradients. PipeDream uses weight stashing to eliminate inconsistent weight but still has delayed gradients. PipeMare eliminates the overhead of weight stashing with ""Discrepancy correction"", but doesn't really deal with delayed gradients except for using an lr warmup.

The two methods PipeMare proposes are:

T1 - Learning rate rescheduling: a type of learning rate warm-up where the warm-up period is based on the pipeline delay.

T2 - Discrepancy correction: a type of backward weight prediction for reconciling the weights used in the forward and backward pass. While T2 deals with weight inconsistency, it does not mitigate for gradient delay.

Issue 2: If T1 is a type of learning rate warm-up why does the paper not show a baseline run with just a regular learning rate warm-up? My guess is that a regular learning rate warm-up would do just as well as this new convoluted method T1.

Issue 3: In Table 3 the PipeMare paper shows that T1 on its own works just as well as T1 + T2. Why use T2? It doesn't seem to help and just has overhead. PipeDream's weight stashing eliminates weight inconsistency; T2 only mitigates for weight inconsistency and does not eliminate it. In [2019 Chen et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02839) proposed a method called SpecTrain. In their work, they show that weight inconsistency is not a big issue and eliminating it by use weight stashing is useless. If weight inconsistency is not a big issue (as shown in the SpecTrain paper), why use T2 (especially since Table 3 shows that it is useless)?

T1 isn't novel / there is no evidence that a simple lr warm-up wouldn't do just as well. T2 looks like it's useless. The methods are neither novel nor useful. How did reviewers at MLSys not see this?

I mean the paper is interesting. The pipelined execution model is interesting. The analysis is interesting, but the mitigation methods (ie the paper's contributions) are incremental at best. How does this get in?

Personally, I think the [SpecTrain paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02839) (similar topic, better mitigation but the method analysis isn't that good) is a much better paper that should have been published at conf but wasn't. NOTE: I am not an author on the SpecTrain paper.

If anyone is attending MLSys2021, could you question the authors on the points brought up in this post. My only request is that the questions be asked nicely. Like I said their analysis of delayed optimization is still really interesting, and they do explore the world of fine-grained pipelined training ie they're actually exploring non-mainstream execution models; even if Pipelined Backpropagation has existed since 1993, it hasn't really been used on modern NN.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

In the paper, Figure 7 and Figure 8 show that when the pipeline depth is **artificially** increased to be very large, T2 becomes useful, but at that point, pipelined training has a hard time achieving the same accuracy as SGD; at that point maybe you shouldn't even be using pipelined training at all?"

I trained StyleGAN2 ada on 3100 Hearthstone's cards,the results were amazing, but they started look more and more the same, untill it got to a point where it just generated the same 3 cards! 1 spell and 1 or 2 minions, and all of them with a very similar artwork.

I tried again with all of the augmentation pipeline options on and got the same results! It node collapsed after 20 ticks and just got less and less variation as it went on!


I wanted to ask, what are the ways to deal with node collapse?  And what are the ways to deal with node collapse specifically in StyleGAN2 ada.

The dataset seems like it has a lot of variation, it's 3100+ cards, they look similar for the most parts, but there are different types of cards and each card has a unique artwork, but somehow the generated artworks looked the same after 40 ticks! 

I really want it to works, any advice or direction towards solution will be super helpful, I don't even know what's causing it.

Farconion,MachineLearning,1620326515.0,[D] Any value in negative / null results?,"I am in the middle of completing a small independent research project  under a ML professor at my college.

hotpot_ai,MachineLearning,1617654345.0,[D] Overview on SOTA methods for deep learning model compression,"**Intro**

This post covers model inference optimization or compression in breadth and hopefully depth as of March 2021. This includes engineering topics like model quantization and binarization, more research-oriented topics like knowledge distillation, as well as well-known-hacks.

Each year, larger and larger models are able to find methods for extracting signal from the noise in machine learning. In particular, language models get larger every day. These models are computationally expensive (in both runtime and memory), which can be both costly when served out to customers or too slow or large to function in edge environments like a phone.

Researchers and practitioners have come up with many methods for optimizing neural networks to run faster or with less memory usage. In this post I’m going to cover some of the state-of-the-art methods. If you know of another method you think should be included, I’m happy to add it. This has a slight PyTorch bias (haha) because I’m most familiar with it.

Hello. I am hyunwoongko who is studying natural language processing. In many Asian languages such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, the pre-trained sequence to sequence model is necessary, but it is currently lacking.

So I made Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English Bart models by pruning the embedding layers of the facebook mBART model. The mBART model is a multilingual language model with 25 languages.

Therefore, I have organized only the necessary tokens in each language so that this model can be used in the monolingual setting.

The Voronoi tessellation is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects.

jj4646,MachineLearning,1619239577.0,[D] Automatic Feature Engineering during Deep Learning,"I have often heard that one of the reasons that deep learning methods are preferred over other machine learning methods is because algorithms like deep neural networks do not require the analyst to spend as much time ""selecting variables for the model"" (i.e. feature engineering, feature selection, feature extraction).

Apparently, deep neural networks are able to ""intelligently"" (in the background) consider and create many different combinations of ""features"" that are ""conducive"" to the modelling problem.

Naturally, I was curious about this claim. Intuitively, I understand that through the hidden layers, weights and activation functions, neural networks are making ""new combinations"" of features that are passed forward and are ultimately used for making predictions on new data.

Beyond this, I am not sure what to think - are there any references/papers that have documented (either theoretically or empirically) that deep neural networks are able to largely ""take care"" of the task of ""feature engineering"" compared to traditional algorithms like regression models, decision trees and random forest? Have any experiments been done where many irrelevant features were added to a dataset, and a deep neural network was able to ""ignore"" them?"
NotThatGuy97,MachineLearning,1617633514.0,[D][P] Feedforward Noise Cancelling Project. Looking for some advice before i dive into details.,"  

Hi I am beginner with ML and finished one minor project yet using a simple neural network.

Now I am heading towards a new project which is more complex and searching for good approach.

Since I have not much experience, I want to introduce you the project and hoping for some ideas. 

(Which approach makes sense NN, RNN, RL or alternative approaches?)

The main goal of the project is to find parameters (amplitude (A\_i)  and phase  (P\_i) at fixed frequencies (i) (i=50Hz, 100Hz… ) for a sinusoid ) for a signal generator. The generated signal is then added to the “main” signal in order to cancel out some noise (which consist of these n x 50Hz frequencies). Basically, it is a noise channeling problem and can be solved by a feedforward algorithm.

The input is a measurement (duration 2-8 seconds) of the main signal. If a Fourier transformation (FFT) is performed the amplitudes of the 50Hz harmonics (50Hz,100Hz,150Hz…) are clearly observable (in the FFT). With the correct A\_i and P\_i the amplitude of the frequency i can be suppressed (so the frequency is compensated by the additional introduced signal created by our signal generator). The goal is now to find these perfect A\_i and P\_i for each frequency i.

The first measurements have shown that for each FFT\_amplitude(frequency i), a unique minimum can be found and a gradient towards this minimum has been observed ( simplified: FFT\_amplitude= (A\_i)\^2+(P\_i)\^2) .

The loop for the optimization would look like:

1. Measurement of the main signal --> FFT

2. Input (n x 1 array) : \[FFTamptitude\_1,…., FFTamptitude\_n\]

3. Optimization algorithm (NN, RNN, RL ) ?

4. Output (n x 2 array): \[\[A\_1,P\_1\],\[A\_2,P\_2\],…. ,\[A\_n,P\_n\]\]

5. Signal processing

6. Measurement of the main signal with the added signal

&#x200B;

The Loss function could look like:

Loss = sum ( FFTamptitude\_i ), (trying to minimize the loss function)

&#x200B;

Since FFT\_amplitude= (A\_i)\^2+(P\_i)\^2, a training simulation can be created in order to “pre”-train the algorithm. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hope I made the situation clear.

One problem to me:

The output is an array of parameters, but the loss function has to be calculated with the measurement of point 6 (see above). I would have to treat the output as a layer in order to get the backpropagation working right? (Please add some advice)

Furthermore, the algorithm has always to wait for the Measurement. Is that an Issue? I want to use Keras.

&#x200B;

What do you think? Are NN, RNN, RL capable to solve this task?

Which would be the best approach? What problems do you see? 

Do you know any comparable project or paper? (Please share it)"
timscarfe,MachineLearning,1618582221.0,[D] Francois Chollet interview on ML Street Talk," In today's show we are joined by Francois Chollet.

He has extremely interesting views on intelligence as generalisation, abstraction and an information conversation ratio. He wrote on the measure of intelligence at the end of 2019 and it had a huge impact on my thinking. He thinks that NNs can only model continuous problems well, which have a smooth learnable manifold and that many ""type 2"" problems which involve reasoning and/or planning are not suitable for NNs. He thinks that many problems have type 1 and type 2 enmeshed together. He thinks that the future of AI must include program synthesis to allow us to generalise broadly from a few examples, but the search could be guided by neural networks because the search space is interpolative to some extent.

&#x200B;

\*\*Approaches I have considered\*\*:

1. tf-idf

2. Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF) embeddings and its developments (uSIF, p-SIF).

3. BERT or bert-like embeddings, e.g., [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467)

4. Hierarchical Optimal Transport for Document Representation (HOTT): [https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/8b5040a8a5baf3e0e67386c2e3a9b903-Abstract.html](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/8b5040a8a5baf3e0e67386c2e3a9b903-Abstract.html)

&#x200B;

\*\*Question\*\*:

Is there an unsupervised technique that has been shown in a peer-reviewed setting to achieve higher accuracy (or F1 or similar) on long texts (more than, say, 10000 characters) than HOTT?

&#x200B;

\*\*Background\*\*:

The HOTT paper benchmarks various approaches with a k-NN classifier and shows that HOTT performs best, but not dramatically better than tf-idf (HOTT has 0.52 vs tf-idf's 0.66 normalized error). Note that while the HOTT algorithm is unsupervised the datasets in the paper are labeled, otherwise a benchmark would not be possible.

The SIF papers mostly deal with the STS datasets which are not long texts. p-SIF has a benchmark on the Reuters dataset, but uses a SVM supervised approach. Interestingly, the HOTT paper finds that SIF does not perform well with the k-NN approach with 0.79 normalized error.

In many cases BERT requires pre-training and if it does not, its max or average pooled performance (pooling over BERT layers) appears to be worse than glove embeddings ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467) page 114).

I have also not been able to find unsupervised benchmarks for Doc2Vec, Universal Sentence Encoder (USE).

&#x200B;

There is additionally the question of how to calculate the similarity once the embedding is obtained (e.g., [https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1100.pdf](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1100.pdf)) but that is out of scope for this question unless it affects comparison between unsupervised benchmarks (e.g., the k-NN approach can use various distance metrics which may affect accuracy).

&#x200B;

If the benchmarks in HOTT are representative and no other methods exist that perform substantially better it is tempting to make the conclusion that tf-idf is still a strong approach since it is so simple to implement and understand (it is certainly simpler than HOTT). If that is the case I think it is a remarkable conclusion given the deep learning developments in the last 5-10 years.

We have thus 'controlled for' color confounding in our image so that the CNN part of our model architecture accounts for everything but that. As we are worried about shenanigans with future data points having the effect of color being reversed, we thus create prediction on future data points by ignoring the color effect on the prediction.

It is particularly well suited for **Machine Learning** (see [examples](https://github.com/criteo/fromconfig#machine-learning)). Launching training jobs on remote clusters requires custom command lines, with arguments that need to be propagated through the call stack (e.g., setting parameters of a particular layer). The usual way is to write a custom command with a reduced set of arguments, combined by an assembler that creates the different objects. With fromconfig, the command line becomes generic, and all the specifics are kept in config files. As a result, this preserves the code from any backwards dependency issues and allows full reproducibility by saving config files as jobs' artifacts.

I'm currently working on a personal project where I try to optimize deep learning algorithms with respect to the hardware on which it is deployed and so far I've had some pretty decent results; The idea is that some hardware handles some computation better than other. You can then build a simulator that shows you the utilization of each blocks in your neural network and arrange your model so that it keeps the same capacity, but improves the computation time significantly. (e.g. see this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02838.pdf)

Eventually, the goal would be to select a piece of hardware on which your model will be deployed on and optimize your model by the click of a button.

I'm now wondering if a solution like that would made any business sense, and I'd love to know more about your use cases.

So, for those of you who are deploying machine learning models to edge devices:

1) What kind of application do you deploy on IoT devices and is latency typically a problem?

2) How much time do you spend optimizing a model for computation time?

I started off with generic conditional strategies, however after those proved relatively inefficient and simple, I tried moving onto a machine learning approach. 

I've been using XGBoost and python and I'm trying to figure out an efficient way to classify short term price movements, which in this case is the dependent variable I'm trying to predict with my model. I've tried using the % change over the next 5-10 candles but that didn't work too well. I'm not really looking for a specific answer, tbh I'm just curious on everyone's thoughts on this application (predicting short term price movements) of random forests.

We analyze the most computationally hard parts of StyleGAN2, and propose changes in the generator network to make it possible to deploy style-based generative networks in the edge devices. We introduce MobileStyleGAN architecture, which has x3.5 fewer parameters and is x9.5 less computationally complex than StyleGAN2, while providing comparable quality.

grid_world,MachineLearning,1618074601.0,[R] Finding important neural network connections,"Most of the research work related to neural network pruning revolves around iterative pruning ever the general idea is to prune p% of connections per iterative round either locally or globally, structured vs. unstructured. A common criterion is absolute magnitude weight based pruning (Han et al., Frankle et al.).

Since this is an iterative pruning technique, the number of such rounds are large to say prune from 0% to 99.5%.

Is there some other pruning technique to overcome this shortcoming? It's kind of like trying to identify the important connections before the entire training process such that this iterative process can be skipped."

Why is this seen as acceptable?  In other fields (e.g., a medical journal), manuscripts with 3-5 data points and no statistical analysis would be immediately rejected, and rightfully so (and if the authors responded and said ""well we couldn't afford a larger study"", no one would see that as a legitimate excuse).  However, **none of the other reviewers on these papers are raising these concerns**.  Why am I the only one with these concerns?  **Why are papers like these getting accepted at top conferences, and even winning best paper awards?**  Am I missing something, or is this a deep problem with our field (in which case I should stick firmly with “reject” for these papers)?

fripperML,MachineLearning,1616972625.0,"[D] What’s the simplest, most lightweight but complete and 100% open source MLOps toolkit?","I know this has been asked many times and in many different ways. And there are tons of blog posts, articles, videos and courses addressing this and comparing hundreds of tools, libraries, frameworks… And that’s part of my problem: I am facing so many options that I feel like Buridan’s ass, dying of starvation for not knowing what to do.

Although I don’t want to write too much, I need to speak a little about our situation, in order to put the question in our context.

**Our Team**

Our Team is small. We have only four people, which could be qualified as beginner data scientists. One of us has a profile that is a little bit more “engineer”, so data engineer could be more suitable for him. Anyway, we don’t have much experience, neither in Python Projects nor in Machine Learning. What we have is passion and love for ML!

For a couple of years, we have been functioning with SAS, but now we plan to change to the Python landscape, as it is much more vivid and exciting. In the last year, we have made two projects in Python, but without using any good practices at all. Every step was made by hand and prone to error, models were neither monitored nor even deployed (they only were used for making some batch predictions), projects were not properly structured, documentation was painful…

So we know that we need to change it before it becomes unmanageable.

We don’t expect the size of the team to grow fast. Let’s say in a couple of years we can expect 10-12 people working with us (the organization knows the importance of Machine Learning, but economic issues can be an obstacle).

**Our Projects**

For the moment, we have only made “classical” Machine Learning. I mean: no Deep Learning. We have used Pandas and Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, etc. And only in Batch mode. But we expect it to change in less than a year, because we will need to train image classifiers, so it will need to be:

\- Trained using a deep learning convolutional network.

\- Integrated with other applications (that are coded in Java) and fast (real-time).

Other change we expect is to need more distributed computing, as we will need to manage some huge databases that simply do not fit in a pandas dataframe. These are the most important challenges we face.

**Our Company**

We work for a big company, which also imposes some restrictions to us. Mainly:

We do not have budget to spend in MLOps solutions, so everything has to be open and free.

We won’t hire data scientist / data engineers for the moment.

There are some tools, uses by other teams, that we should use as part of the MLOps stack, although they are not the best in the class.

Regarding the last item, a short list of this set of restrictions is the following:

* We have a Cloudera Express installation. It’s the most basic and cheaper Cloudera option, so it does not come with any tool for Machine Learning management. It only gives to us HDFS, Impala, Spark and a set of nodes to run Python scripts on them.
* We have Control-M as the orchestrator and workflow manager tool.
* We have DataStage as the ETL tool.
* We use SVN as the code version system (yes, no git).
* We deploy our projects using a very simplified and self-made version of Docker. It’s a little bit awkward and I think that, if we push a little bit, we could convince the organization to let us use Docker. But if Docker is reachable, Kubernetes is out of our capabilities.
* We have Jenkins for CI.
* We have Visual Studio Code professional licenses.

**Toolset**

With this premises, I have two different and opposed concerns or even fears.

* Fear of not using enough tools and good practices and arriving in a couple of years to a state where we cannot manage our own code, project and models.
* Fear of using so many tools that they impose a burden our small team cannot bear.

It’s clear that we need some MLOps, but how much, I don’t know. I will review some things I have been reading, and I hope you can help me choosing the right tools.

**Python Programming**

It looks like we will program using Visual Studio. We will use a remote interpreter, because we will run things on the Cloudera Nodes, although we will program locally and integrate the code with a SVN repository.

Do we need tools for standardizing our code, like PyLint, Flake8, MyPy or Black? Would you recommend any of those?

**CI and Deployment**

We will use Jenkins. For deployment of our code, is Docker a no brainer, a minimum standard? I tend to think so from what I read, but I’d like to be sure and to have good arguments.

Do we need more tools?

**Project Scaffolding**

I have been reading about PyScaffold, CookieCutter and, best of all (from my point of view), Kedro. I think we will stick to Kedro template, because it offers much more functionality, and I like to think of each project as a set of pipelines to be run. What do you think of Kedro?

**Documentation**

Would you recommend having separate documents, or generating the documentation from the projects, using Sphinx or another similar tool? I tend to prefer the second option, because the first one very likely tend to generate obsolete docs. But I don’t know if the “burden” of the second is too big, and if the generated docs can suffice for a typical ML project.

**Project registry**

Is there any tool that could be used as a “project registry”, like a simple web app where we could navigate through our projects, read the docs and thinks like that? I don’t know. If not, the registry will be the SVN repo with all our projects as folders, and that’s all.

**Data Exploration and Preparation**

I think that Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas should suffice, and when things go big, we should use PySpark, Scala or even plain SQL in Impala. However, I know Dask exists, and newer tools like Koalas or Vaex. What do you think?

For creating data transformation pipelines, we will use Kedro, although there are lots of tools that look interesting, like Dagster.

When we enter the “deep learning” realm, can we keep using the same tools? Should we use another framework like TFX? I’d prefer not, cause learning one framework is hard, and two is worse. If a solution is valid for all our projects it’s better. Or TFX is valid for “classical” ML and Deep Learning?

**Tests**

I think unit testing can be too much burden for us. But I have come to Great Expectations library and think it’s well suited for ML projects. Would you recommend it as an important part of our MLOps stack?

By the way, there is a Kedro-Great Expectations plugin, so we could benefit from that.

**Feature Store**

Is it really needed, especially considering our team size and experience? If so, I have read about Feast and Snorkel.

**Data Versioning**

Is it really needed, especially considering our team size and experience? If so, I have read about DVC.

**Experimenting**

I think it’s an important piece, although I wonder if we really need a tool or we could use our own standard of reports and artifacts to follow what we have tried. But the risk that it goes unmanageable is high.

Kedro has a journal, I don’t know if it can suffice. Also it has a Kedro-MLFlow plugin, so that we could benefit from using MLFlow as the experiment tool.

I have also read about Guild, that seems really lightweigh and easy. I don’t know much more.

**Training**

I developed my own library for doing nested cross validation and, within the same function:

\- Optimizing hyperparameters (both of model and pipeline).

\- Generating a report of the training, to assess the quality of the model.

It’s build mainly on top of Skopt. I did it pip installable, it’s here:

[https://github.com/JaimeArboleda/nestedcvtraining](https://github.com/JaimeArboleda/nestedcvtraining)

So we might use it in our traning workflow (at least in some projects), along with the typical models like XGBoost, LightGBM and all Scikit-Learn. But when we need other frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras, we will see.

**Model Registry**

I think it’s an important piece, although I don’t know if we even could build our own with an standard database. If not, MLFlow seems a mature option.

**Model serving**

I am not sure if it’s included in the previous point or not. Anyway, I have read about Streamlint and FastAPI. Would you recommend any of those?

Is Apache Kafka needed for real time predictions?

**Visualization**

With this I mean sharing with the organization basic web apps with customizable plots, explainable predictions and things like that. I have read about panel, which has the ability of transform a Jupyter Notebook into a simple web app. It might be interesting.

**Model monitoring**

Is there a good free tool for monitoring the models and detecting loss of accuracy, data drift and things like that? Or we should better generate our own script of monitoring to be run periodically?

**BigData**

As I said before, we plan to use mainly Spark when need.

I know it’s a lot of info. Maybe I have overcomplicated myself and I should use only 20% of what I think I should. Or maybe not. I have no idea. Any help will be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks in advance.

**EDIT**  


I should add a couple of things, the first one is spread among two comments:-  I work for the Spanish public Administration. So we do have lots of data to use and explore. This also has to do with the rigidity of our budget and the other things I explained. This also explains why cloud is not an option for us: there are data protection, legal and even political reasons that forbid us to have any data outside of our scope. It's a pity, because I think AWS (or another provider) can help in having part of this stack covered.

As we already use DataStage, the IBM provider told us that soon it will be unified with Cloud Pak For Data, so we might be having soon a Cloud Pak For Data license. I have mixed feelings for that product, do you think it might benefit us more than the opposite?"

xiikjuy,MachineLearning,1619173343.0,[D] Should I report the pretraining results?,"Hello,

I am using a Transformer-based model to pretrain  my unlabeled large data and then finetune the pretrained model on my labelled smaller dataset, just  a regular learning pipeline following the idea of BERT.

My question is, should I report the pretraining results (like the learning curve)? or just need to describe the pretraing steps, optimizers, etc.

For literature using Transformer-based models with this learning paradigm ( pretrain+finetune), it seems most papers didn't report the pretraining results, just the results on donwstream tasks.

Shouldn't they first show that the pretrained model is well-pretrained?

or it doesn't matter that much, even a model performs poorly in pretraining phase but somehow the checkpoint works well on downstream tasks, then no problem at all?

Thanks.

This paper is a spiritual successor of Vision Transformer from last year. This time around the authors once again come up with an all-MLP (multi layer perceptron) model for solving computer vision tasks. This time around, no self-attention blocks are used either (!) instead two types of ""mixing"" layers are proposed. The first is for interaction of features inside patches , and the second - between patches. See [more details](https://t.me/casual_gan/35).

Have you ever thought that it'd be useful to train a model on historical weather data for some chunk of the world, but didn't want to deal with grungy data wrangling on a massive dataset to get it into a convenient format? 

Have you ever just been curious what the average temperature of Egypt in 1985 was?

Well, a friend and I made a webpage that lets you filter the 28 gig NOAA Global Summary of the Day weather dataset down to a small fraction of that, and download just the part you care about, as a csv, here:

**https://gourdian.net/g/eric/noaa_gsod.global_summary_of_day**

Table preview on the left, geographic and time filters and download button on the right. Delivers it as a single, clean csv, which should be easy to import into Pandas, R, a database, or whatever else you like to use to work on tabular data. CSV works with everything!

A bit about our goals and what we're trying to build:

* Filter (optional), click the button, CSV arrives on your hard drive
* Downloads are always a single CSV, no bundles with weird directory structures, no other formats
* CSVs are indexed and filterable by a few column types (lat/long and date/time at the moment), so you can download just the parts you want
* Open licensed datasets are free to download
* No signup required for downloading open datasets
* Search within and across datasets

Basically, our focus is on building something very simple - it won't be as powerful at fine-grained querying as something like BigQuery, but it should be easier to get going with.

This is a super early version of our web/javascript download client (we've never shown it publicly before, our other client is a python library), and we're trying to figure out what to make better, so we'd love any feedback, especially if it breaks for whatever reason. What can we do that would make your life easier?

marcovirgolin,MachineLearning,1619510512.0,[R] Model Learning with Personalized Interpretability Estimation,"For high-stakes applications (e.g., cancer treatment), AI cannot be used lightly and recklessly. We need models we can trust and, to achieve trust, interpretability is a key factor.

The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) concerns *both* methods to explain the behavior of black-boxes such as deep neural networks, and methods to generate white-boxes, i.e., models that are interpretable (think of, e.g., sparse linear models, small decision trees, symbolic expressions).
There are very good reasons why the latter are more desirable than the former, see e.g., the famous paper by Cynthia Rudin: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10154

We proposed a new proof-of-concept work that looks at whether XAI for interpretable model generation can and should be *personalized*. (What follows is essentially taken from the abstract.)
In fact, current algorithms for the synthesis of *potentially* interpretable models rely on objectives or regularization terms that represent interpretability only coarsely (e.g., model size) and are not designed for a specific user. 
Yet, interpretability is intrinsically subjective. 
We propose an approach for the synthesis of models that are tailored to the user by enabling the user to steer the model synthesis process according to her or his preferences. 
We use a bi-objective evolutionary algorithm to synthesize models with trade-offs between accuracy and a user-specific notion of interpretability. The latter is estimated by a neural network that is trained concurrently to the evolution using the feedback of the user, which is collected using uncertainty-based active learning. To maximize usability, the user is only asked to tell, given two models at the time, which one is less complex. With experiments on two real-world datasets involving 61 participants, we find that our approach is capable of learning estimations of interpretability that can be very different for different users. Moreover, the users tend to prefer models found using the proposed approach over models found using non-personalized interpretability indices.

Last-Programmer2181,MachineLearning,1617364678.0,"[R] Why can a single large SL model be broken down into smaller SL models, and have better accuracy?","For reference, I am using Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) to perform supervised learning on a dataset.

I have a large synthetically generated set of data, 11 different inputs, and the predicted action as output. After generating nearly a million different data points, I trained a SL model and achieved roughly 70% classification accuracy. I did the normal hyperparameter sweeping, and accuracy varied anywhere from 60-70%. The data is very unique, in the sense that there are many different combinations of the eleven inputs, leading to twenty-seven different possible classifications (actions). (I know these numbers are pretty specific, but I just want to give a sense of what I'm dealing with).

The actions could range from, 'do nothing', 'do something X', and 'do something Y'. Where 'do something X' had A many possible variants/similar actions, and then same with 'do something Y'

What I decided to do was break this one larger SL problem, into small chunks. I broke the single larger problem into four much more manageable models, one leading into the next. (Model A -> B -> C -> D, ultimately predicting the same result as the larger singular model)

The first model would simply decide 'do nothing' or 'do something', where I combined all of the 'do something X and Y' into a single prediction. And achieved a model prediction accuracy of 95%+. And so on, where I kept making the models more and more specific, ultimately leading me to the same twenty-seven different possible classifications I had in the one larger model. (Each model had an accuracy of 95%+, for reference).

Each model would always have the same 11 inputs, I just removed the data points no longer relevant, based on the previous model's choice.

Why would one larger model, trying to do everything, have a much lower classification accuracy than multiple models (doing the same thing) that have a classification accuracy of 95%+?"

They trained a 200 billion parameter decoder-only dense transformer for 40B tokens on 2048 Huawei Ascend 910 chips. Moreover, this was all done using MindSpore, Huawei's ML framework.

In contrast, GPT-3 was a 175B parameter model trained for 300B tokens. 

On its own, this is already quite impressive. Even though they've only done 40B tokens, this is the biggest model yet out of China, and represents one of the biggest models yet in the world. 

However, the thing that's really impressive to me is that this was done with an all-Chinese stack: Huawei Mindspore as the framework, compiling down to Huawei Ascend chips. 

I'd known that Huawei was working on AI chips, but I was unaware that they had matured to the point that they could feasibly train a model of this scale.

WigglyHypersurface,MachineLearning,1618503893.0,[DISCUSSION] How do the different versions of the bootstrap work with deep neural networks?,"I've been looking into deep learning methods as a possible way of imputing missing data, and this has lead me to some questions about how deep neural networks interact with the various versions of the bootstrap.

In a statistical missing data context, the goal is to estimate a posterior predictive distribution for the missing data conditioned on the observed data. You then ""fill in"" the missing data with draws from this distribution, leading to *m* versions of your dataset, where the observed data is the same, but the missing data vary. You do your analysis *m* times and use some simple formulas to combine the analyses, which gives you a nice clean picture of how much uncertainty in the missing data reduces your confidence in whatever hypothesis your testing.

Ok, now the deep net part. In the statistics literature on missing data, there is this idea of ""properness"" which says that you want your posterior distribution for the missing data to reflect all sources of uncertainty, in the model you used to fill in the missing data. Your model for filling in the missing data either needs to be fully bayesian, or approximate a fully bayesian model if that isn't possible.

The simplest way to do an approximate proper posterior in missing data world is often to use either a parameteric or nonparametric bootstrap. For parametric bootstrap, you 1) train a model (say, learning mu and sigma in a linear regression), 2) sample predicted values for the outcome variable, (ie make a new outcome variable by sampling from the learned mu and sigma) 3) retrain the model using the sampled values as the new dependent variable, and 4) make whatever predictions/inferences you want from this second model. If you do this a bunch of times you'll aproximate a bayesian posterior. Nonparametric bootstrap you resample you data with replacement and train on the resampled data. Again, repeated many times you'll get an approximate posterior.

So my questions are, for a deep neural network:

1) What advantages/disadvatages does a deep net using variational bayes versus a deep net using either version of the bootstrap have? Are these any known or expected biases when doing either form of bootstrapping with a deep neural network? 
2) Will you cause a bias if you don't train the network from scratch for multiple iterations of the bootstrap? Would it be a problem if, for example, you resample the data, but carry-over the weights from a previous bootstrap iteration? 
3) Is there a good resource on how changing to a fully bayesian deep network changes what sort of choices you should make about dropout, batch normalization, activations, etc?"
timscarfe,MachineLearning,1619855005.0,[D] Unadversarial Examples video with Hadi Salman (MIT lab),"Performing reliably on unseen or shifting data distributions is a difficult challenge for modern vision systems, even slight corruptions or transformations of images are enough to slash the accuracy of state-of-the-art classifiers. When an adversary is allowed to modify an input image directly, models can be manipulated into predicting anything even when there is no perceptible change, this is known an adversarial example. The ideal definition of an adversarial example is when humans consistently say two pictures are the same but a machine disagrees. Hadi Salman, a Ph.D student at MIT (ex-Uber and Microsoft Research) started thinking about how adversarial robustness  could be leveraged beyond security.  He realised that the phenomenon of adversarial examples could actually be turned upside down to lead to more robust models instead of breaking them. Hadi actually utilized the brittleness of neural networks to design unadversarial examples or robust objects which are objects designed specifically to be robustly recognized by neural networks.

ploomber-io,MachineLearning,1617292408.0,[D] Incremental builds for ML pipelines,"Hi everyone, I'd like to get some perspective on incremental builds. When developing an ML pipeline, I often have to revisit a processing step  (e.g., update SQL or Python script). Since the output is now outdated, I  have to rerun the pipeline, but I can skip unaffected tasks to save some time; as the pipeline grows, this has a significant impact. The most common example is Make. Incremental builds are a must for me since it allows me to modify something and bring everything up-to-date quickly.

A few orchestrators have this feature: [Ploomber](https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber)  (which I'm developing), DVC, drake (in R), but others don't: dagster,  kedro, prefect. Surprisingly, users from the latter group do not seem to miss (or maybe be aware of) that feature.

My only guess is that people who mostly work in Deep Learning don't see much of a benefit of a make-like tool because there are fewer pre-processing steps.

Am I missing anything? How do you ensure all tasks are using the most recent data?  And more importantly, how do you quickly get all outputs up-to-date?"

While the results presented seemed promising to me (although I'm quite fresh to CIL), I was surprised to read reviewer two's conclusion:

> In summary, the premise of 'class incremental' learning appears weak to me. In practice (in vision applications, ..), most often labeling is manual and highly time consuming, and that's the major bottleneck (getting sufficiently many accurate labels on many classes). As the labels arrive, training or retraining (time and space, batch (re)training) is not the issue with existing batch training methods and computational power.

Besides the fact that this is such a classic reviewer 2 move, traction around papers presenting new CIL methods in vision-specialized conferences has been quite significant, especially recently, which suggests at least some degree of relevance.

The idea of creating multilingual CLIP encoders via teacher learning coupled with machine translation is not very creative, so it is unlikely we will write any proper papers of these. So we thought we might as well share the preliminary models directly.

We will be releasing bigger Multilingual models as soon as they finish training.

There is training data available for the problem. This is a constrained optimization problem where we need to maximize the number of examples covered with as few anomalies detected per example (but atleast one).

Any thoughts on a constrained optimization view of the problem? Is there any research or papers around this topic of cost-constrained anomaly detection in corpus of sequential data?"

Let's look at Figure 8, which concerns the architecture for Semi-Supervised Adversarial Autoencoders. A softmax is used to obtain soft labels for the input image. This soft output is encouraged to be as close to a categorical sample by the objective of the upper GAN. The question is: what happens with the soft label when optimizing decoder? Are you supposed to draw a hard sample from it, or take the argmax?

In the semi-supervised setting it's not that important, but later on in Figure 10 (Dimensionality Reduction with Adversarial Autoencoders), this architecture is reused. Here the softmax output is used as a cluster head selector. Is this a soft or hard selector?

The way I see which makes kind of sense, is as follows: to optimize the upper GAN, you use soft labels. But to optimize the decoder using reconstruction error, you sample from it. But this implies that the gradients of the reconstruction error will not flow through the softmax layer.

Can someone clarify this for me? Thanks!"

meowklaski,MachineLearning,1618758483.0,[P] MyGrad: Drop-In Autodiff for NumPy,"[https://github.com/rsokl/MyGrad](https://github.com/rsokl/MyGrad)

 

MyGrad is a lightweight library that adds automatic differentiation to NumPy – its only dependency is NumPy!

MyGrad's primary goal is to make automatic differentiation accessible and easy to use across the Python/NumPy ecosystem. As such, it strives to behave and feel exactly like NumPy so that users need not learn yet another array-based math library. 

  
\`\`\`

 \>>> import mygrad as mg 

\>>> import numpy as np 

\>>> x = mg.tensor(\[1., 2., 3.\])  # like numpy.array, but supports backprop! 

\>>> f = np.sum(x \* x)  # tensors work with numpy functions! 

\>>> f.backward() # triggers automatic differentiation  

\>>> x.grad # stores \[df/dx0, df/dx1, df/dx2\] 

array(\[2., 4., 6.\]) 

\`\`\`

  
It works by leveraging NumPy's new(ish) protocols for overriding its functions. Thus MyGrad could eventually be used to bring autodiff to CuPy, xarray, sparse array, and other array-based libraries.

This has proven to also be a very useful library to help folks learn about auto-diff and machine learning. I first created it to support a class that I teach, but it has become a fully-fledged autodiff library since then!"

Basically, the model is given hundreds of microscopy images of feces and applies Object Detection to all of them in order to find at least one out of a few possible cases of infection.

The way this impacts the problem is that the bulk of negative images can be eliminated by the model, and just the images that might contain eggs of parasites will be analyzed by a biomedic This person will then review the detection and classify it accordingly.

Recently it has come to me that the classification part of the scheme isnt important at all, and the problem could be solved with a approach more similar to Anomaly Detection, by creating a network that can classify images as ""suspicious of infection"" or negative images.

Are there any current researches going on about the specific problem of triage in ML, or is this problem novel? It seems urgent to solve this issues as the WHO has declared it intends to eliminate all NTDs by 2030 and the biggest obstacle to achive this is scalable cheap diagnosis."

It can't dance, backflip, and do any of the other tricks that Spot, Handle, and Atlas could do. But it might be the most commercially successful robot the company has created so far.

Successful autonomous mobile robots hinge on versatility/robustness on the one hand, and cost-efficiency on the other.

On the versatility side, they follow the rules of machine learning: The narrower the domain, the more robust the ML model. You can have a robot that can do many tricks and fail often, or one that can do a few tricks but very robustly. Stretch fits this description perfectly. It does one thing (move boxes) in a predictable environment (flat grounds in warehouses), so you can rely on it to work safely and robustly in most cases. And given BD's long history in computer vision and robotics, they can push the limits of versatility beyond their competitors without compromising robustness/safety.

On the cost-efficiency side, since BD has been acquired by Hyundai, they will be in a better position to manufacture their robots at low costs, and then ship further enhancement props to make them even more versatile.

So, Stretch is not cool, but has the potential to turn BD into a profitable company. Meanwhile, it can continue on working to push the limits of science with its research on humanoid and biped robots.

It's kinda like the patent-clerk job Einstein held in the early 1900s. It helped him pay the bills while he used his idle time to develop some of the most important scientific theories of history.

**Abstract:**

Reward-based optimization algorithms require both exploration, to find rewards, and exploitation, to maximize performance. The need for efficient exploration is even more significant in sparse reward settings, in which performance feedback is given sparingly, thus rendering it unsuitable for guiding the search process. In this work, we introduce the SparsE Reward Exploration via Novelty and Emitters (SERENE) algorithm, capable of efficiently exploring a search space, as well as optimizing rewards found in potentially disparate areas. Contrary to existing emitters-based approaches, SERENE separates the search space exploration and reward exploitation into two alternating processes. The first process performs exploration through Novelty Search, a divergent search algorithm. The second one exploits discovered reward areas through emitters, i.e. local instances of population-based optimization algorithms. A meta-scheduler allocates a global computational budget by alternating between the two processes, ensuring the discovery and efficient exploitation of disjoint reward areas. SERENE returns both a collection of diverse solutions covering the search space and a collection of high-performing solutions for each distinct reward area. We evaluate SERENE on various sparse reward environments and show it compares favorably to existing baselines."

Non-linguistic information is vital for having natural (human-to-human) communication. By changing the non-linguistic information, such as adding emotion to speech, VC can make human-machine communication sound more natural. This allows people to get more information from speech and thus socialize better. 

Humans use several languages for communication, and we often need machine translators for speech-to-speech conversions. Prof. Akagi from JAIST explains that conventional (monolingual) VC models face challenges when we apply them to a “cross-lingual” VC (CLVC) task. For example, changing the speaker’s identity led to an undesirable modification of linguistic information.

jj4646,MachineLearning,1619072335.0,"[D] is the ""curse of dimensionality"" still as relevant as it was 20 years ago?","I have been reading some good examples that explain (in layman's terms) what is the curse of dimensionality. 

These examples first considers a circle inside a square (2 dimensions: example 1) - and then considers a sphere inside a cube (3 dimensions: example 2). This is to illustrate the fact that the cube in example 2 is a lot more ""emptier"" (ratio of volume between sphere and cube) compared to the square in example 1. As the number of dimensions increase (e.g. the cube becomes a hypercube in 4 dimensions), it can be mathematically shown that the ratio of emptiness increases more and more. In this analogy, the sphere represents the data and the cube represents the space which the data belongs to. These examples show us that in higher dimensions, we need exponentially more and more data to fill this space - thus, in higher dimensions, data becomes more ""sparse"", and this sparsity makes it harder to fit machine learning algorithms (I understand this is intuitively, but I don't know if there is a mathematical explanation behind why sparsity gives machine learning algorithms a hard time - perhaps sparsity makes some of the matrix calculations harder to calculate? ). Furthermore, it can be shown using ""Chernhoff's Inequality"" that in higher dimensions, data is probabilistically more likely to occupy the extremity regions of the space, further exacerbating the curse of dimensionality.

All this being said - how are modern machine learning examples (e.g. deep neural networks) able to overcome the curse of dimensionality? Some of these CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) deal with pictures that are by nature high dimensional data, and thus likely to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Yet companies like Google and Microsoft are constantly developing neural networks that are able to successfully make predictions on pictures. 

By the looks of it, it would appear that ""the curse of dimensionality is dead"" (or rather, it doesn't affect us that much as it once did). How are modern neural networks able to handle the curse of dimensionality? I was reading about techniques called ""manifold learning"" which are able to extract important information from the data and reduce the number of dimensions (thereby mitigating the curse of dimensionality). Just a thought - somewhere within the architecture and all the hidden layers in neural networks, is some form of ""dimensionality reduction"" taking place?"

emystats,MachineLearning,1616606233.0,"[P] Best way to calculate ""performance"" in a probability estimation task","Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this long post!

I am working on a task in which participants estimate the probability that a series of beads are extracted from one of two hidden jars. The beads are extracted one by one, with replacement. 

The [two jars](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5fO8Hm.png) contain beads in two colors, yellow and black, in different proportions. *Jar A contains 85% yellow beads and 15% black beads, and jar B contains 85% yellow beads and 15% black beads.*

While the jars are hidden to the participant, he or she is aware of the difference between them - therefore he or she can estimate the probability that a sequence of beads is extracted specifically from one of the two jars. 

**Example**

After each extraction, the participant always answers the same question: ""What's the probability that the sequence was extracted from jar A?

Then, if the first bead extracted is yellow, it's more likely that bead was extracted from jar A; if the second bead is also yellow, it's now even more likely that the sequence of beads was extracted from jar A, and so on.

The estimation, of course, changes as the participant is shown more beads. All participants are shown the same sequence.

**The actual task**

At ""Event 0,"" the participant is asked the question before seeing any beads. This is why the estimation in this [plot](https://i.imgur.com/xl7qxlk.png) is at 50%. 
In the plot, you can see a red line: that's the estimations for one participant. On the x-axis, you can see the extraction number (or event number), on the y-axis the probability estimation.
In black you can see the ideal observer's estimation, that is, the correct probabilities.

Then the participant is shown a sequence of beads that have already been extracted. In this case, [8 yellow beads and 2 black beads](https://i.stack.imgur.com/P2ZTpm.png). 

That's why, at this point (Event 1), the sequence is most likely coming from jar A.

After that, the participant is shown more beads, extracted one by one. They all happen to be black (the participant does not know this beforehand, of course.) That's why the probability estimation slowly decreases.

[Final sequence](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nrBBmm.png)





**The problem**

I would like to define a ""performance profile"" for each participant, based on how he or she responds to the task. Then I would like to be able to correlate this ""profile"" with some psychometric results (average responses to surveys.)

About the ""performance profile"", I would like to have a good idea of how much the participant is far off from the ideal observer. I thought I could just calculate the distance between each pair of points on the y-axis and sum them up. Probably the absolute distance or the squared distance would be better, but I would also like to retain the ""sign"" (in other, similar tasks, the participants' responses both overestimate and underestimate the ideal observer's estimation.)

Using the distance, I could easily correlate the ""performance"" with the personality data.

**Question**

Does this make sense? I was wondering if there are better ways to perform this type of analysis. Is there a way I can retain more information about the participant's choices? For example, I thought I could fit one curve to the participant's response and one curve to the ideal observer's estimation and evaluate the difference between the parameters defining the curves, but I am not sure about how to go about that.

Someone has suggested that I instead perform a [time series k-means clustering](https://drkeithmcnulty.com/2020/03/02/clustering-time-series-data-in-r/) to group participant's responses. I am not familiar with this analysis but that could be an idea. But if I perform a clustering analysis, could I then see how each cluster performs with respect to the personality criteria? For example, ""people in cluster A are particularly high in X criterium."" I also thought about performing a [PCA](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/112-pca-principal-component-analysis-essentials/) to see how the personality criteria are correlated (another analysis I am not too familiar with!) The question is how to relate the psychometric results to the performance.

By the way, [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVMSq.png) you can see an image of all the participants. 

If you have any ideas, or if you can recommend online example or tutorials I would really appreciate it!

**When**: May 17th 9am-4pm PST. 

**Where**: [Live over Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5DGBWjiULQ),

**Goal:** How does the Brain/Mind (perhaps even an artificial one) work at an algorithmic level? While deep learning has produced tremendous technological strides in recent decades, there is an unsettling feeling of a lack of “conceptual” understanding of why it works and to what extent it will work in the current form. The goal of the workshop is to bring together theorists and practitioners to develop an understanding of the right algorithmic view of deep learning, characterizing the class of functions that can be learned, coming up with the right learning architecture that may (provably) learn multiple functions, concepts and remember them over time as humans do, theoretical understanding of language, logic, RL, meta learning and lifelong learning.

The speakers and panelists include **Turing award** winners Geoffrey Hinton, Leslie Valiant, and Godel Prize winner Christos Papadimitriou ([full-details](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/conceptualdlworkshop/home)).   

**Panel Discussion:** There will also be a panel discussion on the fundamental question of “**Is there a mathematical model for the Mind**?”. We will explore basic questions such as “Is there a provable algorithm that captures the essential capabilities of the mind?”, “How do we remember complex phenomena?”, “How is a knowledge graph created automatically?”, “How do we learn new concepts, function and action hierarchies over time?” and “Why do human decisions seem so interpretable?”

wattnurt,MachineLearning,1620102631.0,"[D] Are there any ML algorithms that can learn a simple ""X+1"" problem?","I've had this idea for a while, a very simplistic problem statement:

Suppose you have N binary inputs and N binary outputs. The simple problem is: for any arbitrary input, copy that to the output, but set one more output bit to 1. Any of them will do. As an example, input is 0010010, a correct output would be 0011010.

Now, N should of course be large enough to not just exhaustively learn the input/output set during training. An interesting side effect of this problem is also, for any input there are usually several correct outputs (as many as there were 0s on the input).

Are there any  ML algorithms that can learn something like this?

niels_vg,MachineLearning,1617358952.0,Predict Company Sales - Design choices; how to store incoming sales/which model to choose? [P],"Hi Folks,

I am trying to predict the bookings of a stand-up comedian cafe. There are a lot of features I can use which have an affect on the number of sales. (e.g. day of the year, weather, average sales last month, day of the week, average sales on the specific day of the week etc.)

The goal is to create a model which is able to predict the number of sales for a given day once every hour, starting 10 days (240 hours) before the show and stops one hour before the deadline of the show. We have multiple predicting variables which are always known and do not change, these are:

* **avg\_30**. Average daily sales in the last 30 days
* **avg\_60**. Average daily sales in the last 60 days
* **vacation**. hot/cold variable which indicates whether it is a vacation day
* **LongtermGrowth**; the number of days the company already exists to measure continuous growth
* **DayofYear**. The day of the year. ( min: 1, max: 365)
* **Weekday**. Each day of the week hot/cold encoded. (moday: 0/1 etc.)

Apart from the above variables we have one more indicator (maybe the most important of all) which highly correlates with the eventual sales we are trying to predict. This is a combination of the two variables:

* **currentHour**. The number of hours before the start of the show (min: 0, max: 240)
* **Current sales.** The number of sales already obtained

***My Question***: Is what would be the best method to store all of the data above in such a way I can sufficiently train a prediction model on it. For the *currentHour* and *CurrentSales* I am in doubt between the following two methods.

1. I can simply use two column in the X data. where (1) indicates the number of hours before the deadline and (2) indicates the number of sales already obtained. However, this doesn't provide us any information on how the sales were obtained.
2. I can create a column for each hour before the deadline (240 columns in total). named hr\_01 until hr\_240. Where the value of each hour would be the number of sales yet obtained during that timestamp. The downside of this solution would be that 240 of the 246 columns only hold this data; is this a good idea? This will most likely drastically increase computational time?

*Concluding* I have the following two questions: **(1)** What would be the best of the two methods described above to store the sales yet obtained?, if you have a better idea than the two scenario's I created above, i would be glad to hear it! Furthermore, **(2)** what type of prediction model would you think results in the best performance? Currently I am seeing high performance with Linear Regression (Lasso & Ridge). I can hardly believe this would result in best performance.

Thanks in avance."

Fast-paced and interdisciplinary domains like ML are even harder to stay on top of, and require researchers to self-curate from a variety of sources (bookmarks, newsletters, arXiv reviews, etc.) on the topics relevant to them. The Collaboratory is a webservice that aims to ease the pain of exploring and keeping up with the research that’s most relevant to you.


Our platform automatically sources and recommends the latest research relevant to your interests, based on papers you seed into “reading lists”. These recommendations are powered by large language models that a) transform research descriptions into semantic embeddings, and b) compare those with pre-computed embeddings from a growing index of over 100M+ papers and datasets. Our models ensure that your recommendations are highly relevant, and our indexing efforts ensure that they are timely.


We were inspired to solve this problem after encountering it in our own daily lives, checking dozens of sources a week to stay on top of the literature in a few different fields. We think this tool will be really useful for people spinning up on new topics, people whose interests lie in-between fields, and for people who need to keep up with a stream of research that moves quickly.

In general, this is quite a challenge because as agents learn, their policies change, making multi-agent environments highly non-stationary. Our key insight is an Orwellian one -  we can use present information to alter past messages to improve future learning. This involves relabelling messages sampled from the replay buffer to reflect the current communication policies of each agent. We find this greatly enhances agents' abilities to learn, substantially improving the performance of multi-agent RL algorithms across a range of experiments.

seuqaj114,MachineLearning,1618486921.0,[P] Nimbo: Run jobs on AWS with a single command,"Hey everyone,

My friend and I just launched [Nimbo](https://nimbo.sh), a dead-simple CLI that wraps AWS CLI, allowing you to run code on AWS as if you were running it locally. GitHub: [https://github.com/nimbo-sh/nimbo](https://github.com/nimbo-sh/nimbo). Docs: [https://docs.nimbo.sh](https://docs.nimbo.sh).

We decided to build this because we were frustrated with how cumbersome using AWS was, and we just wanted to be able to run jobs on AWS as easily as we run them locally. At the same time, we wanted to make use of cheap spot instances (on Nimbo, this is a single parameter). All in all, we didn't like the current user experience.

For this reason, we also provide many useful commands to make it faster and easier to work with AWS, such as easily checking prices, logging onto an instance, or syncing data to/from S3 (you can see some useful commands [here](https://docs.nimbo.sh/useful-commands)).

Unlike other similar services, we are solely client-side, meaning that the code runs on your EC2 instances and data is stored in your S3 buckets (we don't have a server; all the infrastructure orchestration happens in the Nimbo package).

We have tons of ideas for Nimbo, such as one-command Jupyter notebooks on EC2, add docker support, and (my personal favorite) provide images with preloaded large datasets like ImageNet, so that you don't have to download and store it yourself - you simply spin the instance, and the dataset is available at `/datasets`.

We are happy to receive any feedback and suggestions you have."

chimp73,MachineLearning,1619910179.0,"[D] How far can we get with one-shot learning, generalization and policy gradient?","[OpenAI research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) shows that merely scaling up simple NNs improves performance, generalization and sample-efficiency.
Notably, fine-tuning GPT-3 converges after only [one epoch](https://github.com/cabhijith/GPT-3_Docs/blob/master/Fine-Tune.md).
This raises the question: Can very large NNs be so sample-efficient that they one-shot learn *in a single SDG updates* and reach human-level inference and generalization abilities (and beyond)?

Assuming such capabilities, I've been wondering what could an actor model look like that makes use of them: Chiefly, one could eliminate the large time horizons used in RNNs and Transformers, and instead continuously one-shot learn sensory transitions within a very brief time window, by predicting the next few seconds from previous ones. Further, one could dedicate some output neurons to driving some actuators and train them with policy gradient. Then long-term and near-term recall would simply be generalizations of one-shot learned sensory transitions, and, similarly, decision making would simply be generalization of one-shot learned modulations to the policy.

(To make clear what I mean by one-shot learning by SDG and recall by generalization: Let's say you are about to have dinner and you predict it is going to be pasta, but it's actually fish. Then the SDG update makes you one-shot learn what you ate that evening due to the prediction error. When asked what you ate the next day, then by generalization (from the context of yesterday, to the context of the question), you know it was fish.)

Further, one could use each prediction sample as an additional prediction target such that the model one-shot learns its own predictions as thoughts that have occurred; and by generalization and reward modulation, these thoughts become goal-driven, allowing the agent to ignore the prediction objective if it increases reward (e.g. pondering via inner monologue instead of listening). One would also need to feed the prediction sample as additional sensory input in each time step such that the model has access to these thoughts or predictions.

Then conscious thoughts are not in a latent space, but in sensory space. This matches the human mind, as we, too, cannot have thoughts beyond our model of the data generating process of sensory experience. Further, conscious thoughts would occur in brief time slices, which also matches human conscious thoughts, skipping from one thought to the other in almost discrete manner, with consciousness hence only existing briefly [during the forward passes](https://karpathy.github.io/2021/03/27/forward-pass/), and reality being re-interpreted each second afresh, tied together via one-shot learned contextual information in the previous steps.

By allowing the model to learn from imagined/predicted rewards too, imitation learning would be a simple consequence of generalization, namely by identifying the other agent with the self-model that naturally emerges.

The mere self-model of one's predictions or thoughts, being learned by predicting one's own predictions, seems  sufficient for thoughts to get strategically conditioned (by previous thoughts) such that they are goal-directed, again relying on generalization. I.e. the model may be conditioned to do X by a one-shot learned policy update, but by world knowledge it knows X only works in context Y (which establishes a subgoal). The model also knows that its thoughts act as predictors, thus, by generalization, in order to achieve X it generates a thought that the model expects to be completed in a manner that is useful to get to Y.

The architectural details may not matter much. Ignoring economic factors, there is not a large difference between different NN architectures so far. Even though Transformers [perform 10x better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) than LSTMs (Fig. 7, left), there is no strong divergence, i.e. no evidence of LSTMs not being able achieve the same performance with about 10x more resources. Transformers seem to be mostly a trick to get large time horizons, but they are biologically implausible and also not necessary if you rely on one-shot learning tying together long-term dependencies instead of long time-horizons.

Generalization would side-step the issue of meticulously backpropping long-term dependencies by temporal unrolling or exhaustively backpropping value information throughout state space in RL. Policy gradients are extremely noisy, but human-level or higher generalization ability might be able to filter the one-shot learned noisy updates, because, by common sense (having learned how the world works though the prediction task), the model will conclude how the learned experience of pain or pleasure plausibly relates to certain causes in the world."

Hello,

I am now implementing FedAvg using PyTorch.

Even after looking into some Github repositories, I am still confusing: testing models

My main question is:

(1) Should I prepare test dataset for each client?  
(i.e. each client has its own training/test dataset)

OR

should I use globally identical test set for all client?  
(since after finishing FedAvg, all the clients have the model with the same weights)

\---

(Detailed description)

I am now dealing with MNIST dataset with 10 clients.

Each client has only one digit: Client 0 has digit 0, Client 1 has digit 1, ... , Client 9 has digit 9.  
(for the simulation of non-IID setting)

After local training, each client sends parameters to the central server, the server then aggregates them, and finally re-distribute the averaged model to clients.

For testing the averaged model's performance, should I test only once using test dataset having all digits (the former case in the above question), or test 9 times using locally split test set (each having only one digit) and calculating mean to report the final performance?

\----

It is very confusing... If the latter is true, each client finally has the ability to encode the unobserved data (e.g. for Client 0 having only 0 digit sample, it is finally available to encode another digits (1-9) after FedAvg). Am I right?

But when used in robots, the accuracy degradation can cause safety risks, according to a [research paper](https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/03/22/adversarial-training-robot-learning/) by IST Austria, MIT, and TU Wien.

Key points:

\- Adversarial training has been designed for static image classification tasks, where each inference task is independent of others. Robotics deal with dynamic environments, where inferences are done in dependent sequences.

\- In robotics, it doesn't just matter how often errors happen but also *where* the errors take place, i.e. if they happen in consecutive cycles, they can result in the robot crashing

\- Classic adversarial training metrics only measure the number of misclassification errors. In robotics, it is also important how far the prediction error deviates from the correct label.

NahanTrogn,MachineLearning,1618195876.0,[Discussion] About pre-processing audio for Yamnet's input,"Hi community ML, 

This is first time I post a question in forum.

I read the input of [Yamnet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/yamnet#input-audio-features) as:

""**Input: Audio Features**

As with our previous release VGGish, YAMNet was trained with audio features computed as follows:

All audio is resampled to 16 kHz mono. A spectrogram is computed using magnitudes of the Short-Time Fourier Transform with a **window** size of 25 ms, a window hop of 10 ms, and a periodic Hann window.

 A mel spectrogram is computed by mapping the spectrogram to 64 mel bins covering the range 125-7500 Hz. A stabilized log mel spectrogram is computed by applying log(mel-spectrum + 0.001) where the offset is used to avoid taking a logarithm of zero. 

These features are then **framed** into 50%-overlapping examples of 0.96 seconds, where each example covers 64 mel bands and 96 frames of **10 ms each**.""

So, my question is why each frame length 10 ms ( ""where each example covers 64 mel bands and 96 frames of **10 ms each""** )? But not 25 ms? I think that because 25 ms is a length of a window of STFT, while 10ms is only a ""window hop"".

Thanks in advance. Wish you a good day."
ottawalanguages,MachineLearning,1619755336.0,[D] How sensitive are statistical models to the richness of information within the data?,"I spent the last hour thinking and creating an example that illustrates my question : https://imgur.com/a/36gU0pb

My question indirectly relates to exploratory data analytics and feature selection for statistical models. Suppose you have some variables (let's assume they are categorical variables for this example) - when you make a histogram for these variables, they appear extremely skewed. On first glance, you would not want to include heavily skewed variables as inputs for a statistical model - e.g., if 99% of the variable is a single value, how informative and useful could it be to a statistical model?

But how do you know that these heavily skewed variables don't contain some very useful information in the 1%, that might really help you in making future predictions?

Sometimes, using the context of the problem (e.g. if you working on a biology problem, consult with the biologists) you might be able to gain some insights - other times, you can try to use some logic to figure out if these heavily skewed variables are in fact useful for the model ... but when you have big and complex data, how is it possible?

I posted an example above that illustrates this problem (https://imgur.com/a/36gU0pb) - I would be curious to know if any of you have dealt with similar problems in the past.

Thanks"

Professional-Bag392,MachineLearning,1617261893.0,[D] Is there a way to evaluate model during training?,"I am working on a Machine Learning Project. I have set up a ML pipeline for various stages of project. The Pipeline goes like -

Data Extraction -> Data Validation -> Preprocessing -> Training -> Model Evaluation

Now as Model Evaluation is concerned, currently it happens after training is completed. Based on evaluation, if model is approved or rejected. Now what I want is model evaluation to take place during training itself at any point. Say at about when 60% of the training is complete, the training is stopped and model is evaluated, based on which if the model is approved, it resumes the training.

How can the above scenario be implemented?"
johndoe709,MachineLearning,1616437000.0,[D] Gender Bias in Persian to English Google Translate,"The third person pronoun in many languages is neutral or so-called epicene. In translating texts from these languages into languages in which the third person pronoun is not neutral, such as English, the translator usually either determines the gender of the pronoun in general (he/she) or assumes it using evidence. Below you can see the translation of a text from Persian to English done by Google Translate:

I have to point out that Google Translate is a lot better than it was a few years ago. And it helped me write this text. I'm curious about the solution to avoid bias in language models. And is there a solution at all? Because these models are trained with texts that we humans have produced.

Some highlights of the article:

* Human intelligence arises from optimizing for three main constraints: limited time (lifespan), limited computation (must fit inside a single brain), and communication (must be able to transfer solutions to other brains to sustain humankind). 

* The space of problems human intelligence is solving is a subset of potential problems we want artificial intelligence to solve. Most machines do not face the same constraints humans do, so they will not necessarily have to use the same solution. 

* There are some use cases of machine intelligence where one has limited time, bandwidth, and high latency communication. In such cases, understanding how humans can optimize around such constraints can provide valuable insight."

I get that there are long-term portfolios that get rebalanced every d days, while there are short-term portfolios that when mod(t,d) != 0, then the agent can choose to update to the short term portfolio.

thunder_jaxx,MachineLearning,1616698147.0,[R] Replacing Rewards with Examples: Example-Based Policy Search via Recursive Classification,"Abstract: 

In the standard Markov decision process formalism, users specify tasks by writing down a reward function. However, in many scenarios, the user is unable to describe the task in words or numbers, but can readily provide examples of what the world would look like if the task were solved. Motivated by this observation, we derive a control algorithm from first principles that aims to visit states that have a high probability of leading to successful outcomes, given only examples of successful outcome states. Prior work has approached similar problem settings in a two-stage process, first learning an auxiliary reward function and then optimizing this reward function using another reinforcement learning algorithm. In contrast, we derive a method based on recursive classification that eschews auxiliary reward functions and instead directly learns a value function from transitions and successful outcomes. Our method therefore requires fewer hyperparameters to tune and lines of code to debug. We show that our method satisfies a new data-driven Bellman equation, where examples take the place of the typical reward function term. Experiments show that our approach outperforms prior methods that learn explicit reward functions.

fabien-campagne,MachineLearning,1618632546.0,[P] Multi-modality Perceiver implementation for Pytorch,"I forked Phil Wangs' repo implementing Perceiver for Pytorch and fixed two problems with the implementation:

1. The figure in the preprint and text indicate that the cross attention block is followed by a 'Latent Transformer'. The text indicates that the latent transformer has 6 blocks when training on ImageNet. This repo , to be fair, most re-implementations I have seen for Keras or JAX make the same mistake and use a single latent block, not a 'Latent Transformer' made up of several blocks. 
2. The signature of the forward method in this implementation cannot support training with multi-modality inputs. Multi-modality is when you want to train with video, audio and image for instance as inputs to the same model. The signature does not support multi-modality because each modality has a different number of dimensions, and positional encoding must be applied to each modality independently. This is not possible when accepting a single tensor as input to forward if positional encoding is done in the forward method.

The repo also offers an experimental contribution to help with text as one of the input modalities.

I have implemented fixes for these two issues in this fork: [https://github.com/fac2003/perceiver-multi-modality-pytorch](https://github.com/fac2003/perceiver-multi-modality-pytorch), the package is available from PyPi (pip install [perceiver-multi-modality-pytorch](https://github.com/fac2003/perceiver-multi-modality-pytorch))."

While we really miss physical seminars, we find that online seminars are amazing for a myriad of reasons (time, cost, ecology, networking, ...). We do not want these perks to stop. We envision a future where seminars will consist in a hybrid mixture of in-person and online audience, and are building our platform around this vision. We aspire to leverage modern technologies in academia to:

&#x200B;

* Make the life of the seminar organiser **as easy as possible**
* Allow every academic **to open the doors of any academic seminar with a couple clicks**  — *while some talks are public, others require a registration that needs to be reviewed by an organiser*
* Offer a place for **online seminar participants to socialise** with each other before and after the event (Virtual cafeteria in the form of a dynamic gather.town)
* Provide a way for **physical and online seminar participants to interact with each other**
* Give every community from every institutions **an equal chance to shine worldwide**: only the quality of their event matters.

If our vision resonates with you, please have a look at the website [https://agora.stream](https://agora.stream/)! We have been witnessing an exponential increase in traffic since our release. Research groups and university societies from Oxford, UCL, Stanford, and all over the world are publishing content on a regular basis.

ottawalanguages,MachineLearning,1618956370.0,[D] Why do polynomials have a bad reputation for overfitting?,"We all must have heard by now - when we start learning about statistical models overfitting data, the first example we are often given is about ""polynomial functions"" (e.g. see the picture here: https://ardianumam.wordpress.com/2017/09/22/deriving-polynomial-regression-with-regularization-to-avoid-overfitting/) .

We are warned that although higher degree polynomials can fit training data quite well. they surely will overfit and generalize poorly to the test data.

My question is : Why does this happen? Is there any mathematical justification as to why (higher degree) polynomial functions overfit the data? The closest explanation I could find online was something called ""Runge's Phenomenon"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon ), which suggests that higher order polynomials tend to ""oscillate"" a lot - does this explain why polynomial functions are known to overfit data?

I understand that there is a whole field of ""Regularization"" that tries to fix these overfitting problems (e.g. penalization can prevent a statistical model from ""hugging"" the data too closely) - but just using mathematical intuition, why are polynomials known to overfit the data?

In general, ""functions"" (e.g. the response variable you are trying to predict using machine learning algorithms) can be approximated using older methods like fourier series, taylor series and newer methods like neural networks. I believe that there are theorems that guarantee that taylor series, polynomials and neural networks can ""arbitrarily approximate"" any function. Perhaps neural networks can promise smaller errors for simpler complexity?

But does anyone know why polynomials are said to have a bad habit of overfitting, to the extent that neural networks have largely replaced them?

jakedageek127,MachineLearning,1616442294.0,[P] Mars 2020 Images Sorted by Content Diversity,"Hi all,

Spun up this quick project over the weekend! The [main outreach site](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/) for raw images from the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover is great, but it only sorts in chronological order. These missions by nature take multiple pictures of the same target, so the gallery pages can get a bit repetitive.

I made a new (very simple, webdev is not my passion :) ) gallery site that uses the DEMUD algorithm (unsupervised novelty detection) to prioritize novel and interesting images. The result is a very content-dense and content-diverse collection of images you can skim through more easily. 

http://jakehlee.com/m2020-content-diverse/#

The ""How Does This Work"" button explains the methodology, but I'll paste it below. I'm trying to update the results once in the morning and once in the evening, since images roll in throughout the day. I'll also be in the comments to answer any questions!

---

Because Perseverance takes many images of the same object by design (such as calibration targets), sorting them chronologically in a gallery results in many pages of similar content. To find all of the different objects and content in the gallery, you have to flip through hundreds of pages of thousands of images.

The DEMUD algorithm solves this problem by prioritizing the set of images with the most diverse and novel content. It quickly identifies one of every item and ranks them for you to look at. If you give DEMUD a massive orchard, it will return with one of every fruit. This can be very useful for quickly finding interesting things in a large dataset.

The DEMUD algorithm is also capable of explaining why it thought an item was interesting enough to bring to your attention. It's not implemented here, but check it out below.

**Steps**

1. Extract features from each image with ResNet-50's last fully-connected layer prior to softmax
2. Find interesting images with DEMUD
3. Display the top 500 in order of prioritization

However, machine learning (ML) datasets are not perfectly labeled. The processes used to develop datasets often involve automatic labeling or crowdsourcing, inherently error-prone techniques.

Prior work has majorly focused on noises in train sets of ML datasets. Not many studies concentrate on label errors in test sets, Yet they have diverse potential consequences. No study has looked at systematic error across the most-cited ML test sets. 

Benchmark test datasets are used to evaluate the ML models and validate the theoretical findings. If label errors occurred extensively, they could potentially undermine the framework by which we measure machine learning progress. Label errors in the test sets could mislead practitioners to incorrect conclusions about the model’s performance.

**Abstract**:

Large, fine-grained image segmentation datasets, annotated at pixel-level, are difficult to obtain, particularly in medical imaging, where annotations also require expert knowledge. Weakly-supervised learning can train models by relying on weaker forms of annotation, such as scribbles. Here, we learn to segment using scribble annotations in an adversarial game. With unpaired segmentation masks, we train a multi-scale GAN to generate realistic segmentation masks at multiple resolutions, while we use scribbles to learn their correct position in the image. Central to the model’s success is a novel attention gating mechanism, which we condition with adversarial signals to act as a shape prior, resulting in better object localization at multiple scales. Subject to adversarial conditioning, the segmentor learns attention maps that are semantic, suppress the noisy activations outside the objects, and reduce the vanishing gradient problem in the deeper layers of the segmentor. We evaluated our model on several medical (ACDC, LVSC, CHAOS) and non-medical (PPSS) datasets, and we report performance levels matching those achieved by models trained with fully annotated segmentation masks. We also demonstrate extensions in a variety of settings: semi-supervised learning; combining multiple scribble sources (a crowdsourcing scenario) and multi-task learning (combining scribble and mask supervision). We release expert-made scribble annotations for the ACDC dataset, and the code used for the experiments, at [https://vios-s.github.io/multiscale-adversarial-attention-gates](https://vios-s.github.io/multiscale-adversarial-attention-gates).

I actually referenced this video in the [MLOps](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mfca0p/d_whats_the_simplest_most_lightweight_but/) post in a deeper comment thread, but I felt it deserved its own discussion.

My abridged analysis:

* Machine Learning and data science are currently model-centric - In ""project-oriented"" teams (without a backing product), I would actually rephrase it as ""experiment-centric"", in the sense that most workflows are something in the lines of ""Problem \[under\]specification"" -> ""SOTA Literature review"" -> ""Data collection"" -> ""Model\[s\] estimation"" -> ""MVP"".
* Ng advocates for a data-centric approach, which alleviates the problem underspecification issue, and shifts focus from the often fruitless model fiddling to what actually delivers value - quality data.
* It doesn't feel like an actual ""MLOps"" talk, in the sense that no actual ""project patterns"" or ""tools"" are presented.
* Given the last point, in the QA, I felt that Andrew Ng's [comments](https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo?t=3182) about ""maturity"" of MLOps tools and internet tutorials, and the ""vertical"" approach advocacy are actually a veiled critiscism to the current MLOps landscape.

I was underwhelmed at first, given that it's Andrew Ng and MLOps is such a hot topic, but afterwards it really bugged me how *bad* data management can be, especially in the ""project-oriented"" scenario.

Any thoughts?"

GiuPaolo,MachineLearning,1618052104.0,[R] Last CFP for the Evolutionary RL workshop at GECCO 2021.,"Only 2 days before the deadline for the 1st **Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning workshop** @ GECCO 2021, the premiere conference in evolutionary computing (this year held  virtually at Lille, France, from July 10-14, 2021)

In recent years reinforcement learning (RL) has received a lot of attention thanks to its performance and ability to address complex tasks.  At the same time evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been proven to be competitive with standard RL algorithms on certain problems, while being simpler and more scalable.

Recent advances on EA have led to the development of algorithms like Novelty Search and Quality Diversity, capable of efficiently addressing complex exploration problems and finding a wealth of different policies. All these results and developments have sparked a strong renewed interest in such population-based computational approaches.

Nevertheless, even if EAs can perform well on hard exploration problems they still suffer from low sample efficiency. This limitation is less present in RL methods, notably because of sample reuse, while on the contrary they struggle with hard exploration settings. The complementary characteristics of RL algorithms and EAs have pushed researchers to explore new approaches merging the two in order to harness their respective strengths while avoiding their shortcomings.

The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration, share perspectives, and spread best practices within our growing community at the intersection between RL and EA.

The topics at the heart of the workshop include:

* Evolutionary reinforcement learning
* Evolution strategies
* Population-based methods for policy search
* Neuroevolution
* Hard exploration and sparse reward problems
* Deceptive reward
* Novelty and diversity search methods
* Divergent search
* Sample-efficient direct policy search
* Intrinsic motivation, curiosity
* Building or designing behaviour characterizations
* Meta-learning, hierarchical learning
* Evolutionary AutoML
* Open-ended learning

Autors are invited to submit **new original work**, or **new perspectives on recently published work**  on those topics.

Convolutional Neural Networks have dominated computer vision for nearly 10 years, and that might finally come to an end. First, Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable performance, and now even simple MLP-based models reach competitive accuracy, as long as sufficient data is used for pre-training. This paper presents MLP-Mixer, using MLPs in a particular weight-sharing arrangement to achieve a competitive, high-throughput model and it raises some interesting questions about the nature of learning and inductive biases and their interaction with scale for future research.

I learned how to produce a couple of types of signals with this data, but there is one problem with them - frequent false positives. To combat this feature, I want to add markup. And then train the classifier...

For mark up purposes on time series data will be needed in near future annotation mechanism for my work project.

Requirements for functionality:
* Many-classes labeling
* In plot labeling or/and labeling by index/value/out of threshold
* for a large number of time series - the ability to maintain / fill several markup sessions at once
* editing marked values
* the ability to work with sub series of the last n values ​​of the time series
* tagged data statistics

JosephLChu,MachineLearning,1619818568.0,[R] Work In Progress: A Drop In Replacement For Softmax With Uncertainty Calibrated Scores,"So, I've been working on an activation function that could work as a drop in replacement for softmax, with the main original intention to be to apply the Principle of Maximum Entropy as a prior that would allow the activation function to output better calibrated confidence scores or probabilities in terms of uncertainty.  It uses some formulas I came up with to convert between correlation scores (-1 to 1) and probabilities (0 to 1).  The idea is that certainty can be measured such that 1 = certain, 0 = fully unknown, and -1 = certainly not, and that there is a way to convert between this and 0 to 1 probabilities by setting 0 on the correlation scale to 1/N on the probability scale.  How this is relevant to a neural net is that in some sense, a pre-activation signal of 0 from a given node basically means that everything cancelled out, and that this maps to maximum uncertainty.  Anyways, I don't want to give away too many details given that it's unpublished.

After a lot of time and effort theorizing and then experimenting with many variants of the formula, I think I have something that works.  When I train a network with this new activation function in the output layer on for instance, MNIST, and then test it on notMNIST, the resulting outputs seem much less overconfident than an equivalent network trained with softmax or sigmoid.  However, the accuracy on MNIST itself doesn't change much.

In fact, on most tasks the new activation function gets very similar results to softmax when used in just the output layer.  So, I'm not sure how useful it actually is.

There is one other place where it might affect performance, though at this point I haven't tested this against the larger SOTA models.  I tried using it in place of softmax in the attention heads of a transformer network for language modelling.  The results seem promising, but I don't know if it'll scale or work across more tasks than the toy problem I was able to run on a single GPU.

What I'd like to know from the experienced researchers here is whether or not this project is worth trying to make into a paper and publishing.  While I think I may have something here, I'm not sure if that's my own bias of wanting all the time and effort spent to not be wasted.

Another problem I'm finding is that over the course of the time that I've worked on this project, I've accumulated many variants of the activation function, and determining which one is actually the best on all tasks and scales is proving tricky.  For a while I was concerned that I had several versions that each work situationally, but don't perform better reliably.  So in some sense I have a family of activation functions, some simpler and more elegant than others.

How does one deal with this kind of uncertainty?"

SPECIAL ISSUE INFORMATION

Since the 1980s, Near-Infrared Reflectance (NIR) scanners have been a common companion in laboratories. This technology allows the analysis of the electromagnetic spectrum in bands close to the visible spectrum. As a result, there is a large amount of information that can be analyzed in order to make predictions about a factor such as the quality of the sample.  This advantage of being able to quickly analyze the material without having to destroy the samples have made it so that, in recent times, this kind of equipment has been moved from the laboratory to portable devices in some cases as small as a credit card. Therefore, numerous applications have been developed under the umbrella of this technology, such as analysis of sewer water, determination of food safety, diagnosis of construction material, support on medical and vet diagnosis; the number of applications is near endless.

However, this blossom of applications usually goes along with the requirement of a model which identifies and uses the information in the captured spectra. The relationship between both factors is usually non-linear and complex, so it is necessary to use machine learning techniques to obtain it. Although, it has usually been performed through an analytical process, currently, the application of machine learning has been a step forward in terms of the precision and adjustment of the results. As NIR and machine learning are multidisciplinary technologies, many fields of science and industry could benefit from their use.

Especially, if we focus on feature selection of the bands on the spectra that contain the information required to solve the problem, the application of machine learning needs a process of adjustment to optimize the performance. The aim of this Special Issue is to present the latest advances that have been made in this field, combining both techniques, as well as to show the remaining challenges and the future in this area of research. That is why this Special Issue solicits submissions in, but not limited to, the following areas:

* Selection of features or bands of the NIR spectra, with a special interest in those applications using nano-scale NIR scanners due to its limited operational range;
* Studies of different preprocessing techniques and comparison with automatic features extraction process, such as PCA, LDA, evolutionary computation;
* Developments combining cloud computing, fog computing or edge computing with the processing of NIR spectra in different industrial processes;
* Application and comparative of the latest approaches of machine learning techniques, such as deep learning or ensemble models;
* Works with a particular interest to cover the explainable artificial intelligence in the frame of decision-making using NIR data and machine learning.

I come from an CS engineering background with a masters in AI/ML, my full time position at the moment is that of a data scientist working on clustering models. The quantum computing opportunity is available due to formation of a new team which has a lot of vacancies at the moment.

Although the prospects of Quantum AI/ML sounds hella interesting(although very niche), quantum computing itself seems like an extreme departure from my formal education with its heavy emphasis in physics. This is making me anxious

How viable is this opportunity for my career? How are the job prospects in the domain ( for someone with my background)? Would it help me in creating a niche for myself in data science ?I can admit shamelessly that I'd like a career which pays the big bucks at the same time keep me interested enough.

Would love your opinions"
MrAcurite,MachineLearning,1617202567.0,[D] Does anyone care about the quality of the prose in academic papers?,"I've been reading a lot of great literary works lately, and when I go back to reading academic papers, there is a very noticeable downgrade in the quality of the language employed. And I guess that that makes sense; when you want to communicate technical information, there's not a lot of room or reason to employ metaphors or colorful language.

But it still seems like there has to be some way to make these works better, to make them legitimately enjoyable to read instead of the linguistic equivalent of shoving stale bread down your throat. Obviously there is often a lot of beauty to be found when you appreciate the cleverness of new ideas being presented, but appreciating that is typically in spite of, rather than due to, the actual quality of the writing.

Is this something that anybody else here cares about?"

In principle, they can produce quality adaptive behavior, do not require excessive computer resources for training and operating, and do not suffer from the problem of explainability of generated behavior.

The core method of operation is random selecting the next state of an algorithmic neural net according to probabilities of possible states calculated on the basis of cycles that occur in the neural net.

Currently, the framework has a few examples demonstrating its possible use cases, but their number shall increase in the future. One of the examples is utilizing the framework to adaptively parse a token sequence. I hope more people make use of implemented ideas to transform approaches behind the concept of artificial intelligence.

Acrobatic-Egg-,MachineLearning,1619433901.0,[D] The Journey Of Problem-Solving Using Analytics," 

In my \~6 years of working in the analytics domain, for most of the Fortune 10 clients, across geographies, one thing I've realized is while people may solve business problems using analytics, the journey is lost somewhere. At the risk of sounding cliche, ***'Enjoy the journey, not the destination"".*** So here's my attempt at creating the problem-solving journey from what I've experienced/learned/failed at.

The framework for problem-solving using analytics is a 3 step process. On we go:

1. **Break the business problem into an analytical problem**  
Let's start this with another cliche - *"" If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"".* This is where a lot of analysts/consultants fail. As soon as a business problem falls into their ears, they straightaway get down to solution-ing, without even a bare attempt at understanding the problem at hand. To tackle this, I (and my team) follow what we call the **CS-FS framework** (extra marks to those who can come up with a better naming).  
The CS-FS framework stands for the Current State - Future State framework.In the CS-FS framework, the first step is to identify the **Current State** of the client, where they're at currently with the problem, followed by the next step, which is to identify the **Desired Future State**, where they want to be after the solution is provided - the insights, the behaviors driven by the insight and finally the outcome driven by the behavior.  
The final, and the most important step of the CS-FS framework is **to identify the gap**, that prevents the client from moving from the Current State to the Desired Future State. This becomes your Analytical Problem, and thus the input for the next step
2. **Find the Analytical Solution to the Analytical Problem**  
Now that you have the business problem converted to an analytical problem, let's look at the data, shall we? \*\*A BIG NO!\*\*  
We will start forming hypotheses around the problem, **WITHOUT BEING BIASED BY THE DATA.** I can't stress this point enough. The process of forming hypotheses should be independent of what data you have available. The correct method to this is after forming all possible hypotheses, you should be looking at the available data, and eliminating those hypotheses for which you don't have data.  
After the hypotheses are formed, you start looking at the data, and then the usual analytical solution follows - understand the data, do some EDA, test for hypotheses, do some ML (if the problem requires it), and yada yada yada. This is the part which most analysts are good at. For example - if the problem revolves around customer churn, this is the step where you'll go ahead with your classification modeling.Let me remind you, the output for this step is just an analytical solution - a classification model for your customer churn problem.  
Most of the time, the people for whom you're solving the problem would not be technically gifted, so they won't understand the Confusion Matrix output of a classification model or the output of an AUC ROC curve. They want you to talk in a language they understand. This is where we take the final road in our journey of problem-solving - the final step
3. **Convert the Analytical Solution to a Business Solution**  
An analytical solution is for computers, a business solution is for humans. And more or less, you'll be dealing with humans who want to understand what your many weeks' worth of effort has produced. You may have just created the most efficient and accurate ML model the world has ever seen, but if the final stakeholder is unable to interpret its meaning, then the whole exercise was useless.  
This is where you will use all your story-boarding experience to actually tell them a story that would start from the current state of their problem to the steps you have taken for them to reach the desired future state. This is where visualization skills, dashboard creation, insight generation, creation of decks come into the picture. Again, when you create dashboards or reports, keep in mind that you're telling a story, and not just laying down a beautiful colored chart on a Power BI or a Tableau dashboard. Each chart, each number on a report should be action-oriented, and part of a larger story.  
Only when someone understands your story, are they most likely going to purchase another book from you. Only when you make the journey beautiful and meaningful for your fellow passengers and stakeholders, will they travel with you again.

With that said, I've reached my destination. I hope you all do too. I'm totally open to criticism/suggestions/improvements that I can make to this journey. Looking forward to inputs from the community!"

My current task is to take EMG signal data (time-domain electrical signal data) gathered from a user and classify what finger a person is engaging at any moment. This is a multi-class label classification problem, with 5 total labels possible. This is an example of how such an EMG signal looks like when plotted in Python:

As you can tell by that graph, I have normalized the amplitude range to the range \[0, 1\], and to ensure each time-series is of equal length, I append 0s to both the front and the end of the series to match the length of the longest sequence in the data-set. As a result, each time series is of approximately length 800, with 812 total series. The distribution of each label is approximately equal. The resulting tensor shape is  (812, 794, 1) , so 812 rows, 794 being the length of each sequence, and 1 value stored at each time-step.

I am currently using the following Keras model:

I use an LSTM network with the length of the sequences as the number of neurons, followed by a dropout, followed by a Dense layer, another dropout layer, and a final classification Dense layer. I am using an Adam optimizer algorithm, with a learning rate between 1e-2 to 1e-10. I also tweaked the L2 kernel regularizer values from the default to the range 1e-4 to 1e-7. 

My issue is I have unusually terrible performance, an example of this is:

The validation accuracy is consistently zero, the validation loss continuously increases as if its over-fitting, and the training accuracy plateaus around a value of about 0.2. I have run this model at 1000 epochs before, and validation accuracy nonetheless remained at 0 with the loss increasing. The training accuracy and loss continue to plateau even up to 1000 epochs.

I initially suspected overfitting could be an issue but after dealing with Dropout layers, I do not believe this is the case. Would anyone be will to chat and help me figure out what's going on with the model simply not learning?

I have two datasets to train model on. The first dataset have values within the range 1.0 - 1.1, and another one has 1000-1100 range.

So there is 1% data change between row1.value1 = 1.0 and row2.value1 = 1.011 in first dataset and the same is in another dataset (something like row1.value1 = 1000 and row2.value1 = 1010.09), but these raw values range and targets are different (but again - similar in percentage change).

**Abstract**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the go-to model for computer vision. Recently, attention-based networks, such as the Vision Transformer, have also become popular. In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. ""mixing"" the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. ""mixing"" spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established CNNs and Transformers."
niujin,MachineLearning,1620380538.0,[D] Predictive model for the shape of an entire histogram,"I am working on a project in market research. Survey respondents reply to a survey on a 10-point scale (1 = dislike, 5=indifferent, 10=like). The responses can be shown on a histogram.

I would like to develop an ML model to predict the shape of the histogram for a survey before it the survey is run in the wild. I have a database of past surveys by country, industry, etc. It is straightforward to predict a single value such as the mean of the histogram, but how to train a machine learning model to predict the entire histogram?

So far approaches I am considering:

* train 10 separate and independent models
* train a model for the mean and one for the stdev, and assume normal (a bad assumption I know as these histograms have many different shapes)
* design a custom machine learning architecture with 10 outputs

When I've trained a model to predict the mean of the histogram only, the best performance comes from ensemble models such as Random Forest, or using Auto ML such as Azure ML.

Has anybody tried something similar? I am new to market research but have been in data science for several years."

donkey_strom16001,MachineLearning,1619388491.0,[D] The Rants of an experienced engineer who glimpsed into AI Academia (Briefly),"# Background

I recently graduated with a master's degree and was fortunate/unfortunate to glimpse the whole ""Academic"" side of ML. I took a thesis track in my degree because as an immigrant it's harder to get into a good research lab without having authorship in a couple of good papers  (Or so I delude myself ). 

I worked as a Full-stack SWE for a startup for 4+ years before coming to the US for a master’s degree focused on ML and AI. I did everything in those years. From project management to building fully polished S/W products to DevOps to even dabbled in ML. I did my Batchelor’s degree from a university whose name is not even worth mentioning. The university for my master’s degree is in the top 20 in the AI space.  I didn't know much about ML and the curiosity drove me to university.  

Come to uni and I focused on learning ML and AI for one 1-1.5 years after which I found advisors for a thesis topic. This is when the fun starts. I had the most amazing advisors but the entire peer review system and the way we assess ML/Science is what ticked me off. This is where the rant begins. 

# Rant 1:Acadmia follows a Gated Institutional Narrative

Let's say you are a Ph.D. at the world's top AI institution working under the best prof. You have a way higher likelihood of you getting a good Postdoc at a huge research lab vs someone's from my poor country doing a Ph.D. with a not-so-well-known advisor having published not-so-well-known papers. I come from a developing nation and I see this many times here. In my country academics don't get funding as they do at colleges in the US. One of the reasons for this is that colleges don't have such huge endowments and many academics don't have wealthy research sponsors.  Brand names and prestige carry massive weight to help get funding in US academic circles. This prestige/money percolates down to the students and the researchers who work there. Students in top colleges get a huge advantage and the circles of top researchers keep being from the same sets of institutions. I have nothing against top researchers from top institutions but due to the nature of citations and the way the money flows based on them, a vicious cycle is created where the best institutions keep getting better and the rest don't get as much of a notice. 

# Rant 2: Peer Review without Code Review in ML/AI is shady 

I am a computer scientist and I was appalled when I heard that you don't need to do code reviews for research papers. As a computer scientist and someone who actually did shit tons of actual ML in the past year, I find it absolutely garbage that code reviews are not a part of this system. I am not saying every scientist who reads a paper should review code but at least one person should for any paper's code submission. At least in ML and AI space. This is basic. I don't get why people call themselves computer scientists if they don't want to read the fucking code. If you can't then make a grad student do it. But for the collective of science, we need this.

The volume of scientific research is growing exponentially. Information is being created faster than we can digest.  We can't expect people to know everything and the amount of overlap in the AI/ML fields requires way better search engines than Google Scholar. 

The side effect of large volumes of research is that every paper is doing something ""novel"" making it harder to filter what the fuck was novel. 

I have had so many experiences where I coded up something and came to realize that someone else has done something symbolically similar and my work just seems like a small variant of that. That's what fucks with my head. Is what I did in Novel? What the fuck is Novel? Is stitching up a transformer to any problem with fancy embeddings and tidying it up as a research paper Novel? Is just making a transformer bigger Novel?  Is some new RL algorithm tested with 5 seeds and some fancy fucking prior and some esoteric reasoning for its success Novel? Is using an over parameterized model to get 95% accuracy on 200 sample test set Novel? Is apply Self-supervised learning for some new dataset Novel? If I keep on listing questions on novelty, I can probably write a novel asking about what the fuck is ""Novel"". 

# Rant 4: Citation Based Optimization Promotes Self Growth Over Collective Growth

Whatever people may say about collaboration, Academia intrinsically doesn't promote the right incentive structures to harbor collaboration. Let me explain, When you write a paper, the position of your name matters. If you are just a Ph.D. student and a first author to a paper, it's great. If you are an nth author Not so great. Apparently, this is a very touchy thing for academics. And lots of egos can clash around numbering and ordering of names.  I distinctly remember once attending some seminar in a lab and approaching a few students on research project ideas. The first thing that came out of the PhD student's mouth was the position in authorship. As an engineer who worked with teams in the past, this was never something I had thought about. Especially because I worked in industry, where it's always the group over the person. Academia is the reverse. Academia applauds the celebration of the individual's achievements. 

All of this is understandable but it's something I don't like. This makes PhDs stick to their lane. The way citations/research-focus calibrate the ""hire-ability"" and ""completion of Ph.D. thesis"" metrics, people are incentivized to think about themselves instead of thinking about collaborations for making something better. 

# Conclusion

A Ph.D. in its most idealistic sense for me is the pursuit of hard ideas(I am poetic that way). In a situation like now when you have to publish or perish and words on paper get passed off as science without even seeing the code that runs it, I am extremely discouraged to go down that route.  All these rants are not to diss on scientists. I did them because ""we"" as a community need better ways to addressing some of these problems.


P.S.
Never expected so many people to express their opinions about this rant. 

U shouldn’t take this seriously. As many people have stated I am an outsider with tiny experience to give a full picture.

I realize that my post as coming out as something which tries to dichotomize academia and industry. I am not trying to do that. I wanted to highlight some problems I saw for which there is no one person to blame. These issues are in my opinion a byproduct of the economics which created this system. 

Thank you for gold stranger."

answersareallyouneed,MachineLearning,1617655429.0,[D] Questions on mathematical maturity for PhD/R&D ML,"My current job mostly involves implementing papers and adapting models to fit the needs of the company and math hasn't really been an issue in understanding/implementing papers(So far).

I believe that I lack the mathematical maturity for more competitive positions or to go back for a PhD. I've worked on research in the past, and I'm specifically interested in domain adaptation/synthetic data generation.

A few questions:

1. Is it common for people to come into this work with a ""general understanding of concepts"" and slowly build out the maturity? A lot of my mentors were math/physics majors who later came into machine learning and so perhaps my idea of ""what it takes"" are a bit skewed.

2. I have about 2 years before which I'd want to apply for/start a PhD. I plan on working full-time for those years. What's the most effective way to use this time? What do I study first?

A colleague recommended that I go through real-analysis. It also seems like there's a good portion of this subreddit who have gone through Bishop and The Elements of Statistical Learning at the very least.

TLDR: I'm interested in the field and would like to not be a mediocre mid-level professional. Any advice?"

hallavar,MachineLearning,1617297476.0,[Discussion] Any metric for evaluating non-image synthetic data ?,"Hello, evaluating generated data (obtained by AE, GAN etc..) is always a tricky question.

For images, most of the papers i've read used the Inception score or its evolution, the FiD.

However,  those metrics are based on how well a generated images can be  classified by a pretrained network (this is a summary, no need for  details here)

But if I generate  data that are not image related (like text, sequences, graphs). How can I  evaluate the generation of my model ?

A  good metric should evaluate the plausibility of the synthetic data, ie  the the realism of the generation given the training distribution; but  also its diversity : to ensure that the training distribution is well  understood by the model.

I know how to evaluate the first criterium (realism), but i have no idea how to evaluate the second

If anyone has ever worked on something like that, i will be glad to talk about his/her work.

[Monte Carlo integration with repulsive point processes - Rémi Bardenet](https://criteo.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_i_Vil4YtTpaFsH5Do_hdyg)

Monte Carlo integration is the workhorse of Bayesian inference, but the mean square error of Monte Carlo estimators decreases slowly, typically as 1/N, where N is the number of integrand evaluations. This becomes a bottleneck in Bayesian applications where evaluating the integrand can take tens of seconds, like in the life sciences, where evaluating the likelihood often requires solving a large system of differential equations. I will present two approaches to faster Monte Carlo rates using interacting particle systems. First, I will show how results from random matrix theory lead to a stochastic version of Gaussian quadrature in any dimension d, with mean square error decreasing as 1/N\^{1+1/d}. This quadrature is based on determinantal point processes, which can be argued to be the kernel machine of point processes. Second, I will show how to further take this error rate down assuming the integrand is smooth. In particular, I will give a tight error bound when the integrand belongs to any arbitrary reproducing kernel Hilbert space, using a mixture of determinantal point processes tailored to that space. This mixture is reminiscent of volume sampling, a randomized experimental design used in linear regression.

[Automatic Backward Filtering Forward Guiding for Markov processes and graphical models - Frank van der Meulen](https://criteo.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_6SZkMHlfQHKL3kPalfm5GQ)

I discuss a structured way for efficient inference in probabilistic graphical models with building blocks consisting of Markovian stochastic processes. The starting point is a generative model, a forward description of the probabilistic dynamics. The information provided by observations can be backpropagated through the model to transform the generative (forward) model into a conditional model guided by the data. It approximates the actual conditional model with known likelihood-ratio between the two. The backward filter and the forward change of measure are suitable to be incorporated into a probabilistic programming context because they can be formulated as a set of transformation rules. The guided generative model can be combined with different approaches to efficiently sample latent states and parameters conditional on observations. Application settings include Markov chains with discrete state space, interacting particle systems, state space models, branching diffusions and Gamma processes.

as the title suggests, you can increase the inference speed of any pretrained T5 model and also decrease the models' size, in a single line of code.

The library can be installed with `pip install fastt5.` This code snippet from the repository's README gives a concise overview:

[fastt5 usage](https://preview.redd.it/glra7heve6p61.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea659b124cb5290fc5e1ab4c1a1f6e9380dac0b3)

The fastT5 library exports the T5 model to onnx with `past_key_values`, then quantizes it and runs it on onnxruntime.

The exported onnx models support the `generate()` method of huggingface transformers for inferencing.

WavyShapes,MachineLearning,1616431656.0,[P] Backprop: a library to easily finetune and use state-of-the-art models,"Hi everybody —

I'd like to share [Backprop](https://github.com/backprop-ai/backprop), a Python library I've been co-authoring for the last few months. Our goal is to make finetuning and using models as easy as possible, even without extensive ML experience.

We've currently got support for text and image-based tasks, with wrappers around models like Google's T5, OpenAI's CLIP, and Facebook's BART, among others.

Once you've got your training data, you can just import your model/task, and then finetune with a single line of code.

We've also got some features that make deployment for production easy, but for full transparency, deployment is through a paid platform we've developed that is by no means necessary to use the library.

If you decide to check it out, the docs are [here](https://backprop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and we've got some example notebooks in the repo's [examples](https://github.com/backprop-ai/backprop/tree/main/examples) folder.

We're happy with the progress we've made, but it's still early days — we'd really appreciate any thoughts and feedback we can get, so we can make Backprop more featureful and easier to use in the future."

bendee983,MachineLearning,1618507723.0,[D] Microsoft's ML acquisition strategy,"This week, Microsoft announced the $19.7-billion acquisition of Nuance, a company that uses deep learning to transcribe clinical appointments (and other stuff). What's interesting about the deal is the [evolution of Microsoft's relation with Nuance](https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/04/15/microsoft-nuance-acquisition/), going from cloud provider to partner to owner. 

This is a successful strategy that only Microsoft (and maybe Amazon) is in a position to implement:

Step 1: Microsoft starts by investing in ML companies by giving them Azure credits and luring them into its ML platform. This allows Microsoft to help the companies develop and also learn from them (and possibly replicate their products if it's worth it). Multiple small investments as opposed to one large acquisition is a smart move because many companies are trying new things in ML/DL, few of which will be successful. With small investments, Microsoft can cast a wider net and make sure it is in a good position to make the next move.

Step 2: Microsoft enters partnership with companies that have successful products. This allows Microsoft to integrate their ML products into its enterprise solutions (e.g., Nuance's Dragon DL was integrated into Microsoft's cloud healthcare solution). Since these companies are building their ML tools on top of Azure's stack, the integration is much easier for both companies.

Step 3: Acquire really successful companies (Nuance has a great reach in the AI+healthcare sector). This allows Microsoft to gain exclusive access to the company's data, talent, technology, and clients. With the acquisition of Nuance, Microsoft's total addressable market in healthcare has reached $500B+. And it can integrate its ML technology into its other enterprise tools.

Nuance is just one example of Microsoft's ML acquisition strategy. The company is on a similar path [with OpenAI](https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/09/24/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-license/) and is carrying out [a similar strategy in the self-driving car industry](https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/01/21/microsoft-self-driving-car-strategy/)."

for a uni project I need to replicate a project which uses tensorflow-gpu 1.13 and Cuda 10.0. The only GPU I have at my disposal is a RTX 3080.

Now, from my understanding, the RTX 3080 doesn't support Cuda 10.0, only Cuda 11. In order to use Cuda 11, tensorflow needs to be updated to 2.4.0, but this breaks alot of code. So my quesiton is: am I dead in the water? 

To me it seems like the only solution is to either train the models with a CPU (which has terrible perfomance) or upgrade all code so it is compatible with tensorflow 2.4.0, but this is out of scope of the project.

I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask but if someone has a suggestion on how to get this to run on my GPU, please let me know!"

I'm struggling to find good papers explaining how the amount of different classes affects different models 

For example, say you were building a semantic segmentation classifier for JPG images containing soft drink cans.

Your objective is to find all the cans contained within the image.

Is it better to construct your training data using a generic soft drink can class?

OR is it better to construct your training data using different colours of soft drink cans as seperate classes (i.e. red can, orange can, green can, etc...)?

I am wondering how each of these class naming conventions will affect the overall accuracy classifying every can.

What are your thoughts on this?

Also, if you want, comment on how it can extend to other things, such as cars, clothes, etc..."
AuspiciousApple,MachineLearning,1620578926.0,[D] What's the SOTA/best practice for finetuning pre-trained CNNs on smaller datasets (~10k images)? Any principled approaches? Any papers comparing different schedules?,"There's basically two ways to approach transfer learning: 

A) Treat the pretrained weights as just a particularly efficient weight initialisation method and train a model like normal, focussing on all the other hyperparams, especially data augmentation

B) Use a special protocol to finetune

For B, Francois Chollet recommends to freeze to the lower convolutional layers and only train the added head, and then optionally as a second step also finetune part or all of the lower convolutional layers with a very low learning rate.

[https://keras.io/guides/transfer\_learning/#introduction](https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/#introduction)

Are these special schedules worth it? Is there any research on it?

I'm also happy for any other suggestions for finetuning."

fromnighttilldawn,MachineLearning,1617599998.0,[D] How do you improve your model after obtaining the test error?,"I have a very basic question about training neural networks and ML models that I do not see being addressed in the literature. Consider the following scenario:

&#x200B;

* You chop your data up into train/validation/test with something like 70%, 10%, 20% ratio. 
* You train and perform validation and you feel pretty confident that your model will perform well.
* Then you run your model on the test set, you obtain a high error (or something that falls below your expectation). Yikes!
* Of course, at this stage, you would do anything to improve your model, but *you can't*: **if you try to do anything, you will be effectively using your test set as a training set.**

My question is whether there exist some best/correct practices to improve your model after obtaining the test error. 

I know in the literature there is a lot of hyperparameter tuning after obtaining the test set...I do not wish to follow in their footsteps. 

If not, are there some techniques that allow you to prevent this scenario from happening?

hobogalaxy,MachineLearning,1620042624.0,"[P] General and feature-rich PyTorch/Hydra template for rapid and scalable ML research/experimentation, with a list of best practices","Hi all,

I've been looking for a way to make my research more efficient and scalable. After iterating over a couple of different frameworks and structures, I converged on the following template: [https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template)

To get you a feel of how it might be useful for you, take a look at [\#Your Superpowers](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template#your-superpowers) section of the readme. It's based on PyTorch Lightning with Hydra and its plugins.

I developed it for my research team but I also meant it as a starting point for anyone who would like to learn about this technology stack. I find this combination simple to use but very powerful at the same time. I believe it's very convenient for small-team research, reproducing papers and generally for projects in which you need to maintain many curated configurations of your experiments.

How I find it useful:

* it allows us to painlessly scale from small experiments into hiperparameter search on multi-GPU or SLURM computing clusters (with frameworks like Optuna or Ax). The hyperparameter optimization requires minimal setup: you only need to declare config with hyperparameter ranges and hydra takes care of the whole iterating over jobs logic.
* possibility to use most experiment tracking frameworks (like neptune, wandb, MLflow or just csv files)
* easy configuration management with command line superpowers (no need for argparse thanks to Hydra)
* advanced training and debugging features from pytorch lightning (e.g. gradient accumualation, deepspeed integration, etc.)
* encapsulating datasets into lightning datamodules gives us a very convenient way for understanding and reusing datasets across projects

I feel like most ML people don't use those tools because they simply don't realize all the advantages (especially Hydra seems like a very useful addition to any deep learning project). I focused on structuring the readme in a way, which (I hope) will give you a quick overview - my hope is it can help to spread the word about those frameworks in a broaded community. It incorporates [best practices](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template#best-practices) and tricks I gathered over the last couple of months of playing around with it.

My typical workflow is the following:

1. I write a LightningDatamodule. I found it to be an intuitive way to encapsulate any dataset. LightningDatamodule is a simple abstraction providing methods for data download, split, transforms and exposing dataloaders. Would love to see more researchers try out this concept, even in projects which don't use pytorch lightning. Reading LightningDatamodule makes me immedietely see how the dataset is prepared, while it seems like most data science projects throw around data logic across different parts of the pipeline, making it hard to understand what's going on. You can see example of such datamodule [here](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template/blob/main/src/datamodules/mnist_datamodule.py)
2. I write a LightningModule. This basically just encapsulates my pytorch model code.
3. I add new experiment config specifying the paths to the LightningDatamodule and LightningModule.Now the training can be launched with some experiment tracker attached, like csv logger or tensorboard: `python` [`run.py`](https://run.py/) `experiment=simple_mnist logger=tensorboard`

Btw. the structure is partly based on data science cookie cutter project template. If you didn't hear about it I recommend you to check it out - I found it to be a great source of useful concepts for project organization:

seuadr,MachineLearning,1617201468.0,Machine Learning and HVAC [D]," Hi all,

I am working in HVAC controls deploying a fault detection platform. The product that we have currently is rules based, which is find for many things, but, it is not so great at determining long term performance drift.

I've started a data science boot camp and am learning about machine learning with an eye towards applying this to our buildings/HVAC systems.

we'd like to use datasets to predict things ranging from a general expected energy use for a near future period of time (like, the next hour) to performance drift on sensors and other equipment (like a heating coils performance not meeting expectations for the current conditions)

i think this is all ""do-able"" but it doesn't seem to be an area that is discussed openly on the internet (or my google-fu is weak..)

so i'm not sure where to start. For instance, I've been collecting large datasets from this equipment for years and i'm pretty confident that we can gain useful insight from it, but, how to i automate the process of feeding that in and executing the model?

what kind of intervals should i consider?

can i have it execute on a short time interval, like say, 5 mins and write that out?

what kind of computing power would i need for this? - i currently have a vm with 8 cores and 32gb, i would expect that'd have some ponies to get the job done?

i know these are big, open questions - just looking for some guidance on where to start and see if you all might be aware of existing communities that could help.

Thanks in advance for your time and assistance!

Both u and c are represented by vectors that are spatially meaningful in terms of distance between users u and distance between content c.

Let's say that I only have positive matches between u and c (label 1). Any combination that isn't a positive match is ambiguous in meaning.

Would it make sense to approach this in a semi-supervised manner by assuming any combination of u and c that I sample isn't inherently a negative example (label 0), but that it could in fact be 0 or 1?

Could I then give each sampled combination of u and c a label by looking at how similar the vector u is to the vector of other users that have consumed content c?

The idea is then that if a user is similar to other users that have consumed content c, then the likelihood of him consuming content c becomes higher.

2. Maybe reproduce some models that don’t demand that much compute. (Even in this case i can just check if the code “works” and then push it to the cluster)
3. To train basic GANs, VAEs etc to understand them (main thing is to get results very fast and not wait like an hour)

thunder_jaxx,MachineLearning,1619812725.0,[D] Unpopular Opinion: Conferences Should Mandate a Limitations Section For Any Paper Introducing some New Model / Method / Variant,"The title says it all and I mean a specific limitations section where researchers convey solid limitations of the new methods they propose. I feel such information is very crucial for disseminating good science in the age of AI and ML.  Limitations can be problem-dependent and help ground the claims of a research paper. The review process can help with making this section better. 

Why? few reasons: 

1. If not explicitly stated, we have to go look it up inside a paper and it may not be found. Many times these are hidden as footnotes or concluding remarks which require the cognitive load to read and process. Stating them reduces the cognitive load to think about such stuff because it's covered as a part of good science. 
2. Makes us stick to doing good science over papers becoming a source of benchmark porn. 
3. Keeps clickbaity titles in check. AI/ML Researchers have brought into the advertizing model of clickbaity titles. I am not against clickbaity titles as many times the title has actually been[ really good and spot on](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06644)! But at least for the fairness of science, we should have limitations to ensure that there is a boundary between science and salesmanship. 

I am very aware it puts a lot of load on researchers and seldom people like to do it. But it's healthy cozy it makes us care more about what we learn from the research over what we are selling as research. What are your thoughts?"

The general public's perception of patents is different than reality. In many cases, it is harder to write a paper and make it to top-tier conferences than to write a patent.

brainggear,MachineLearning,1617276285.0,[R] On the Origin of Species of Self-Supervised Learning,
Realistic_Sea_3634,MachineLearning,1620485299.0,"[D] Why has machine learning become such a toxic field, know-it-all field?","I've worked with many scientists from many different fields and backgrounds, but none come close to the obnoxiousness, pomposity, and outright unpalatable know-it-all vibe from the machine learning community. And I'm sure it's a case of a small rotten bunch smearing the whole field.

This behaviour is most rife in 3 places: the cesspit known as Twitter, Reddit, and somewhat in industry. It's much less rampant, comparatively, in academia in my experience (and just so we're clear, Google Brain/DeepMind/FAIR is not academia). Here is some of what I've observed:

* Think they can dominate a field or little involvement from SMEs
   * Often I see in machine learning a group or groups will swarm on a problem, throw ML at the data, and call the problem ""solved"". Very little (if any) SME involved, and importantly, no follow up. The exceptions to this general are few and far between.
* DL encourages a habit of not learning the basics
   * I have encountered this so often, and it is especially apparent in DL. People will jump straight into e.g. CV or NLP, and not bother learning anything foundational. I've seen and spoken to  numerous people publishing in CV papers in prestigious conferences who don't even know what why colour spaces are useful or even what a pixel is (because it sure as fuck isn't a small square on an image). You may claim that they don't need to know this, but that delusional talk, and they absolutely do. There is a limit to what compute + CNN/transformer can do. After that, you need foundations to know how to improve.
* No real work goes into the vast majority of papers (more of a DL problem)
   * This has been cited by many in the past. However, I must articulate it myself. I also understand that there are many contributing factors to this (and indeed all the other) problem. It's most often slight architecture change or incremental improvement, with no real thought gone into the paper. What this sometimes results in (I have seen numerous times myself in a variety of settings - including my own teams) is a PhD being no good at engineering, or less productive at research than an MSc with experience under his belt. The whole point of a PhD coming into an ML team is to be useful at R&D, and that is not always the case (as much as you'd expect).
* Insolence and arrogance of fairness/ethics crowd
   * This crowd - as it currently operates - simply serves as a cancerous tumour to the ML world. There always point out problems, but never (real) solutions. They act like gatekeepers and god's gift to the world. It brings about massive toxicity to the virtual ML community, and prohibits free speech of the community without fear of repercussions. The this crowd could do with an overhaul, as its leaders are some of the most vitriolic yobos who claim to be academics.
* For such an applied field, very little focus on applications
   * Often the excuse put forward is that fields like math have very few applications straight away. Firstly, ML is not like math - it's more like straight up engineering (especially DL). It's primarily applied, and should thus be much more focused on application. Your slight architecture change or you 0.5% improvement on ImageNet is not a Pythagoreon theorem waiting to happen. It's laziness and just wanting to get your PhD (surely if doing a PhD you actually want to make a real contribution to the field that you can stand behind?). Fields like physics and stats are often applied and make a real world impact with the applications. To be fair, ML also does, but nowhere near as much as it should, especially at your average company in industry.
* Can fix all the worlds problems
   * Over-stating the ability of ML. Not sure if delusion, PR, or a combination of both. Cited lots before by others.

&#x200B;

EDIT 1:I don't know why people are focusing on the definition of a pixel. I reiterate that is the ""small square"" model is helpful, useful, and enough for your work/application, then that's great and you should use that. But don't claim your helpful model to be the definition - because it's not. I don't understand why I'm being downvoted for this :/

Thanks for the discussion. I want to understand the Reddit ML community's views on the original content of this post (minus the pixels).

&#x200B;

EDIT2:  
Realised it would be better to put this here, than in the comment as I did:  


Regarding the ethics crowd - I see many people have commented and require me to clarify my position.

I  feel they intentionally try to make mountains out of molehills, and  often (at least from an online perspective) do not want to engage in  civil discourse or debate when presented to them (instead wanting to  just blame and live in their echo chamber). They act like saviours and  pretentious, as if they are doing god's work. The purpose of  ethics/fairness is to try change things to be more ethics/fair in your  community. It's not to perpetually live in your little echo chamber and  try ""cancel"" those who disagree. Utter toxicity.

Never  mind the fact that many of the popular ""researchers"" in that space  preach against toxic large tech companies/CEOs, unfair practices at top  universities and companies, etc., but they are the first to be working  at places like Google, DeepMind, Microsoft, and attending universities  like Stanford and CMU. If you really want to make a difference to the  plight of POC in tech, then why are you working for DeepMind? Go work  for, or consult for, some little random African start up then to empower  them? Fucking hypocritical, will do whatever is convenient and easy.  Simply a popularity contest.

Again,  I found myself venting as I am quite fervent about this. However, with  them it's so often such an apparent display of self-entitlement and  superiority. Granted this is simply from my observations mostly online,  but also somewhat in-person.

__data_science__,MachineLearning,1616513807.0,[D] Advanced Takeaways from fast.ai book,"I recently read the Fast AI deep learning [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50204643-deep-learning-for-coders-with-fastai-and-pytorch) and wanted to summarise some of the many advanced takeaways & tricks I got from it.  I’m going to leave out the basic things because there’s enough posts about them, i’m just focusing on what I found new or special in the book.

I’ve also put the insights into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/140&4&3K3uXPazkg4) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app (video** [**explanation**](https://youtu.be/AD0aFdRCskQ)**) like anki or** [**save all**](https://saveall.ai/) **for the things you learn** otherwise you’ll just forget so much of what is important. Here’s the takeaways:

# Neural Network Training Fundamentals

* Always **start** an ML project by **producing simple baselines**
   * If is binary classification then could even be as simple as predicting the most common class in the training dataset
   * Other baselines: linear regression, random forest, boosting etc…
* Then you can **use your baseline to clean your data** by looking at the datapoints it gets most incorrect and checking to see if they are actually classified correctly in the data
* In general you can also **leverage your baselines** to **help debug** your models
   * e.g. if you make your neural network 1 layer then it should be able to match the performance of a linear regression baseline, if it doesn’t then you have a bug!
   * e.g. if adding a feature improves the performance of linear regression then it should probably also improve the performance of your neural net unless you have a bug!
* Hyperparameter optimisation can help a bit (especially for the learning rate) but in general there are default hyperparameters that can do quite well and so **closely** **optimising the hyperparameters should be one of the last things you try** rather than the first
* **If you know something** about the problem then try to **inject it as an inductive bias into the training process**
   * e.g. if some of your features are related in a sequential way then incorporate them into training separately using an RNN
   * e.g. if you know the output should only be between -3 and 3 then use sigmoid to design the final layer so that it forces the output of the network to be in this range

# Transfer Learning

* Always use transfer learning if you can by finding a model pre-trained for a similar task and then fine-tune that model for your particular task
   * e.g. see [huggingface](http://huggingface.co/) for help with this in NLP
* **Gradual unfreezing** and **discriminative learning rates** work well when fine-tuning a transfer learned model
   * **Gradual unfreezing** = freeze earlier layers and **train the later layers only**, then **gradually unfreeze** the earlier layers one by one
   * **Discriminative learning rates** = having **different learning rates per layer of your network** (usually **earlier** **layers** have **smaller learning rates** than later layers)

# Tricks to Deal with Overfitting

* **Best way** to deal with **overfitting** is by getting **more data**. **Exhaust this first** before you start regularising with other methods
* **Data augmentation** is really powerful and now possible with text as well as images:
   * **Image** data augmentation -  crop, pad, squish and resize images
   * **Text** data augmentation - negate words, replace words with similes, perturb word embeddings (nice github [repo](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) for this)
* **Mixup regularisation** = create new data by averaging together training datapoints
* **Backwards training (NLP only):** train an additional separate model that is **fed text backwards** and then **average the outputs** of your two models to get your final prediction

# Other Tricks to Improve Performance

* **Test time augmentation** = at test time, use the **average prediction** from many **augmented versions of the input** as your prediction rather than just the prediction from the true input
* **1 cycle training** = when you increase and reduce the learning rate throughout training in a circular fashion (usually makes a **huge difference)**
* **Learning rate finder algorithm** = algorithm that Fast AI provide to help you automatically discover roughly the best learning rate
* **Never use one-hot encodings,** use **embeddings** instead, even in **tabular data**!
* Using **AdamW** instead of **Adam** can help a little bit
* **Lower precision training** can help and on [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) is just a simple flag you can set
* For **regression problems** if you know the **output should be within a range** then its good to use **sigmoid** to force the neural net output to be within this range
   * I.e. make the network output:  min\_value + sigmoid(output) \* (max\_value - min\_value)
* **Clustering** your features can help you **identify which ones are the most redundant** and then removing the can help performance
* **Label smoothing** = use 0.1 and 0.9 instead of 0 and 1 for label targets (can smoothen training)
* **Don’t dichotomise** your data, if your output is continuous then its better to train the network to predict continuous values rather than turning it into a classification problem
* **Progressive resizing** = train model on smaller resolution images first, then increase resolution gradually (can speed up training a lot)
* Strategically using **bottleneck layers** to force the network to form **more compact representations of the data** at different points can be helpful
* Try using **skip connections** as they can help smooth out the loss surface

He decided in that very moment that he was going to become an ML researcher.  Tom's view is that the ability to recognise patterns and discover structure is the most important aspect of intelligence. This has been his quest ever since. He is particularly focused on using diversity preservation and metagradients to discover this structure.

jj4646,MachineLearning,1619155260.0,"[D] is this the equivalent of the ""what came first, the chicken or the egg"" in machine learning?","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning

I am learning about this concept in statistical learning called ""Probably Approximately Correct"" (PAC) - although the wording of this can seem complicated and technical, (if I understand correctly) the essence of PAC is to show that if a ""target concept"" (e.g. the set of all possible input points corresponding to a certain output), then the error of a machine learning algorithm can be probabilistically bounded with a certain range. I think all this is intended to show, that a machine learning algorithm is useful for making predictions, instead of basing your predictors off which color socks your neighbor is wearing. 

1) PAC framework was developed in 1984 - yet prior to this, many statistical models were being used for making predictions (e.g. regression models). Once PAC was developed, did researchers have to examine all statistical models they were using prior to this, and confirm if these models were compatible with PAC framework?

2) Now, the same question for modern models. When newer machine learning models are developed (e.g. LSTM models, developed long after PAC framework was established) - are these new algorithms tested to make sure they are compatible with PAC framework?

3) Can someone please confirm if my understanding of PAC framework is correct? (source: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/142906/what-does-pac-learning-theory-mean , https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-a-hypothesis-in-machine-learning/ )  A ""hypothesis"" (in the context of PAC) seems to be a general term for a machine learning algorithm, the ""hypothesis space"" is the space of all possible such algorithms (e.g. a linear regression model with specific beta parameters is a individual hypothesis and all possible linear regression models are the hypothesis space), ""D"" is the distribution of the data, and a ""Concept Class"" - but Im still confused about the differences between target concept and concept class. Can someone please clarify this?"

anianruoss,MachineLearning,1617294131.0,[R] Robustness Certification for Point Cloud Models,"We present the first robustness certifier against semantic transformations (e.g., rotation or shearing) on 3D point cloud models for object classification and part segmentation tasks.

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16652](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16652)

Code: [https://github.com/eth-sri/3dcertify](https://github.com/eth-sri/3dcertify)

**Abstract.** The use of deep 3D point cloud models in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, dictates the need to certify the robustness of these models to semantic transformations. This is technically challenging as it requires a scalable verifier tailored to point cloud models that handles a wide range of semantic 3D transformations. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce 3DCertify, the first verifier able to certify robustness of point cloud models. 3DCertify is based on two key insights: (i) a generic relaxation based on first-order Taylor approximations, applicable to any differentiable transformation, and (ii) a precise relaxation for global feature pooling, which is more complex than pointwise activations (e.g., ReLU or sigmoid) but commonly employed in point cloud models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DCertify by performing an extensive evaluation on a wide range of 3D transformations (e.g., rotation, twisting) for both classification and part segmentation tasks. For example, we can certify robustness against rotations by ±60° for 95.7% of point clouds, and our max pool relaxation increases certification by up to 15.6%."
adammathias,MachineLearning,1619016230.0,"[N] Aim 2.3.0 is out with system resource monitoring, ""reverse grouping"" and more","Highlights with my comments:

### System resource monitoring
An option for automatic tracking of your **GPU**, **CPU**, **memory** and more.  I'm curious how much this covers - disk, network...?

### ""Reverse grouping""
This is what Aim is calling the option to divide by everything but one param (typically seed).  It looks like you pick that variable in the UI for all experiments, it's not clear if you can set a variable as ""default indivisible"" via the API.

### Line chart smoothing
This is self-explanatory.  Maybe be somewhat automatic by default, based on the number of points and scale?

### Standard error and standard deviation
New built-in aggregation modes in addition to min and max

### Support for infinite values and NaN

bendee983,MachineLearning,1617897743.0,[D] Waymo now has a machine learning PhD as its co-CEO,"In 2015, Google hired John Krafcik, a veteran of the automotive industry, to lead its self-driving car efforts, which later spun off as Waymo. Last week, Krafcik stepped down and ceded his role to Dimitry Dolgov, a computer science PhD and a veteran in ML research, and Tekedra Mawakana, a Doctor of Law. 

Why is this important? At the time Krafcik joined Google, the general belief was that deep learning was mature enough for SDCs and reaching production-level SDCs was just a matter of scaling road-testing, gathering enough training data, and training DL models.

But it has become evident that in its current state, DL is not ready to tackle the many challenges of open roads, and many more gaps need to be filled. The legal infrastructure for SDCs is also not ready and many questions remain unanswered.

This is why it makes sense to put an ML engineer and a lawyer at the helm of the company. Deep learning has come a long way in pushing SDCs forward, but a bumpy road still lies ahead.

For various reasons, it's incredibly difficult to Google, or to drill down to any papers on the subject, if there are any. The signal-to-noise ratio has beaten me.

I'm not thinking of GPT-3-style generalized oracles that have infinite scope, that abstract a great deal, and that hide their sources; nor some AI project to scrape and replace Google; but perhaps, rather, a machine learning system that has been tasked with a specific domain, such as blastoma research, or compression, which has a specific audience in mind, and which has a greater level of discernment and judgement regarding the 'quality' of sources than the average search engine.

jj4646,MachineLearning,1619580096.0,[D] do machine learning models handle multicollinearity better than traditional models (e.g. linear regression)?,"When it comes to older and traditional models like linear regression, ensuring that the variables did not have multicollinearity was very important. Multicollinearity greatly harms the prediction ability of a model.

However, older and traditional models were meant to be used on smaller datasets, with fewer rows and fewer colums compared to modern big data. Intuitively, it is easier to identify and correct multicollinearity in smaller datasets (e.g. variable transformations, removing variables through stepwise selection, etc.)

In machine learning models with big data - is multicollinearity as big a problem? 

E.g. are models like randon forest known to sustain a strong performance in the presence of multicollinearity? If so, what makes random forest immune to multicollinearity?

Are neural networks and deep neural networks abke to deal with multicollinearity ? If so, what makes neural networks immune to multicollinearity?

SQL_beginner,MachineLearning,1620156717.0,"[D] ""Classifier Technology and the Illusion of Progress"" (2006, Hand)","https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606441

I found this interesting paper over here, where the author argues that more complex algorithms (e.g. deep neural networks) do not always have significant advantages over simpler algorithms in the real world (hence the illusion). The author brings up many reasons as to why this can happen - some of the reasons are related to mathematics, others are related to experimental design. 

(Note: the author brings up a point here that I am not sure why this is true: ""Conversely, in
the two-class case, although few real data sets have
exactly linear decision surfaces, it is common to find
that the centroids of the predictor variable distributions
of the classes are different, so that a simple linear surface can do surprisingly well as an estimate of the true decision surface"" ...  

Why is it common  to find that the centroids of the predictor variable distributions are different? Why does this allow for a linear surface to estimate the true surface well?)

Here were the thoughts I had after reading this paper: This was paper was published in 2006, before the ""deep learning revolution"" (e.g. in 2012 when Convolution Neural Networks clearly outperformed humans at the imagenet competition). Is it possible that the results from this paper are somewhat irrelevant and outdated? Researchers, universities and companies (e.g. google, Facebook, Microsoft) have probably spent a billion dollars since 2006 on developing more and more complex machine learning models. Using common sense, many of these models have performed well enough so that more research will be done in the future. I agree that for certain problems, perhaps simpler models (e.g. linear regression, decision trees) can perform just as well as deep learning models ... but surely, there are many problems in the real world which require more complex models? Can an argument made as to why complex models are required, using concepts such as the VC Dimension (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension)? Relating to problems such as the initial ""x-or perceptron"" problem - could we not say that big data (data with many columns and many rows) is less likely to be linearly sepperable (i.e. harder to ""shatter"" - shatter =  classify perfectly) compared to smaller datasets? Could we not say that if there are more data points, there exist more configurations that these data points can be arranged in -  making it less probable for them to be analyzed using a simpler model (the VC dimension of a simpler model is lower than the
VC dimension of a complex model) ? Does this fact alone somewhat justify the need to develop complex models?"

Or in other words, the intrinsic dimensionality of the vocabulary-space unearthed by tucker-decomposition like tensor-compression techniques is \~ 32.  
So, you can use much lower dimensional encoding vectors (with \~96% compression) rather than the raw 8192 x 32 x32 D vectors in your post-encoding regression/classification/linear-algebra twiddling pipelines.

I went through the research process, but the application and integration of my idea was not exhaustive due to time constraints. The net result of the research was that integrating the approach into an existing backbone lowered the validation performance slightly on an apples to apples basis.

If anyone had tried this before, maybe it didn't work, but I could find no reference to anyone having tried it.

1. CommonVoice

**Abstract**: We identify label errors in the test sets of 10 of the most commonly-used computer vision, natural language, and audio datasets, and subsequently study the potential for these label errors to affect benchmark results. Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of 3.4% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example 2916 label errors comprise 6% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are identified using confident learning algorithms and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (54% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled). Traditionally, machine learning practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy — our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on ImageNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet-50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6%. On CIFAR-10 with corrected labels: VGG-11 outperforms VGG-19 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 5%.

4. How to learn from fewer examples (one shot learning and semi-supervised learning). The ultimate goal being unsupervised learning that works well in the ""real world"".

ottawalanguages,MachineLearning,1618866478.0,[D] Effective Ways of Choosing the Number of Layers/Neurons in a Neural Network,"I have been reading more about the theoretical backgrounds of neural networks (e.g. ""universal approximation theorem"") and have seen several authors demonstrate that even a simple (few layers, many neurons) neural network can (theoretically) approximate the variable of interest (i.e. the response variable) to a ""decent"" level of precision.  However, the implication being that to use simple neural networks in order to achieve good results, this would require a very large number of neurons. Therefore, deeper neural networks have been developed over the years, which attempt to provide good results with more layers but a fewer number of neurons.

This brings me to my situation: I have never been able to successfully fit a neural network to any real-world data that I have used. I have always gotten really bad results with neural networks (after trying all sorts of combinations of number of neurons, number of layers, learning rate, activation function, ""drop out"" regularization, etc.). This seems to be a hyperparameter-grid search problem.

(Ironically, models like CART decision trees have good results on the same data (supervised binary classification) and random forest has produced even better - this data is not ""small by any means"", contains around 30 columns and over 300,000 rows of data).

 Does anyone know if routines have been written (e.g. in tensorflow keras) that can assist in this problem of deciding the number of layers and the number of neurons? Is there a ""ground rule"" for deciding how many layers and how many neurons to begin with? Is there something around that can ""intelligently"" point you in the right direction for how many neurons/layers to choose?"
Unreasonable_Energy,MachineLearning,1618961433.0,Do we already have the ML technology to make eye contact work better in video chat? [D],"**The problem:**

In video chat, if you make ""eye contact"" with the image of your conversation partner's eyes as they appear on your screen, your eyes are not pointed at the camera, and thus you do not appear, to your partner, to be making eye contact with them, but appear to looking in an offset direction -- [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2430/).

**A solution (in principle?):** 

If you had multiple cameras arrayed at the edges of your screen (say, 3 or 4 webcams around the edges of your screen instead of just 1) it seems like it should be possible, with some machine learning magic, to combine the multiple camera feeds coming from slightly different vantage points into a single feed of a ""virtual vantage point"" within the convex hull of the physical cameras -- that is, a point somewhere in the middle of your screen.  Then all you need is to be able to automatically locate your the image of your conversation partner's eyes within your screen (basically a solved problem, as I understand) and set the virtual vantage point to one of these eye images, or to a point between them -- and voila, when you make eye contact with your screen image if them, they actually see their screen image of you appearing to make eye contact with them.  

**If this would be so easy, why doesn't it already exist?**

Do we not have the machine learning technology already to make this a reality?  Is somebody already doing it?  The potential hurdles that immediately come to mind are:

(1) Learning the virtual-vantage-point transformation would be hard -- maybe?  I'm pretty sure I've already seen more impressive demonstrations of vantage-point-shift than this would require.  I certainly don't have enough understanding of this specialty to know how I'd do it though -- maybe it's hard.

(2) Takes too long to apply the vantage-point transformation in real time, inducing unacceptable lag -- yes, the processing needs to happen in real time, but it can happen on the local machine, and the virtual-vantage-point-feed shouldn't be any more costly to transmit over a network than the standard video feed.  I can imagine applying it locally could be pretty fast, and there already seem to be more superficially-impressive video transformations being applied in real time (face-contouring, etc).

(3) Requires a non-standard hardware setup -- sure, but not like a really expensive or difficult one, just a couple extra webcams and you could do it yourself.  Doesn't work on mobile, but you can't have everything,

(4) Nobody cares about this problem enough to work on it -- I suspect there are surprisingly large gains to be had through making video chat a little less uncanny, but maybe this gain is too small to be worth the effort.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on the feasibility of such a scheme, from a machine-learning perspective."

Competitive-Net-5306,MachineLearning,1617836999.0,[P] About a ML agent for the game Slay the Spire that I've been making,"Hi. I've recently been working on making a setup where I would be able to train and test a machine learning agent for a TCG roguelike game called Slay the Spire. I'd like to share the process and my current status in that project so that I can receive feedback for improvement, and maybe help others who face problems similar to what I went through.

For this project, I had to solve the following problems.

1. Establish connection with the game process, or at least mimic something similar.
2. Find a way to design a model that is capable of making different types of decisions with different format of inputs depending on game state. The model must be able to handle different tasks ranging from selecting card reward to choosing whether throwing a potion at a particular enemy would be beneficial.
3. Find a way to properly reward that model.
4. Run as much games as possible in parallel at any given moment in time

The first problem proved to be a lot easier than I expected. There was already a mod called Communication Mod that practically solved the problem for me the moment I discovered it. It allowed connection and communication between the game process and any arbitrary external python script through stdin and stdout. I just fiddled with it to make it work, and afterwards I was good to go.

Second problem was a bit more tricky, and I'm not quite happy with how I solved it. I just divided the game into distinct situations that requires its own distinct format of input to make its own distinct type of decision. Then, I just made a neural network for every single one of them. I can't shake off the feeling that there might be a more efficient way of doing it, but I'm still a noob.

The way I solved the second problem made solving the third problem a bit more difficult. I wasn't training just one single net, but a collection of nets that together plays the game by trying to predict how beneficial playing some action in some situation would be. I was, however, able to solve it through the following process.

1. Add one extra net to a collection of nets, whose purpose is to predict how much score this AI would get by the end of the game, based on a perfect snapshot of current situation.
2. While the agent is playing a game, create a snapshot at set moments in the game and record every decisions made between each snapshots.
3. When the game is over, assign a label to every snapshots created during that game with a score equal to what it got by the game was over.
4. Train the snapshot net with the label.
5. Label every decision points with snapshot\_score(after) - snapshot\_score(before).
6. Train the nets with the label.

The fourth problem was the most tricky but most enjoyable one to solve. As we all know, more data is usually better when doing machine learning. My data was being generated during training by my agent actually playing the game, so if I could make the agent play more games simultaneously then I would get more data. To do that, however, I had to be able to launch and run multiple games at once.

I was able to achieve that by using virtual machines. Basically, I would create virtual machines as worker nodes that actually runs the game, then make those games communicate with their local python script which would establish socket connection with my main machine that actually runs the agent. But there's one catch. I didn't have enough computing resources to do that in large scale.

My solution to that was google compute engine in their cloud platform. Each instance of it was a virtual machine that can be connected to through the internet, so it was almost perfect for my use. However, putting a GPU to my instances was not practical due to cost, and without it the game run abysmally slow due to rendering issues.

I solved that by just making my own small mod for the game that applies a bytepatch to the code to disable rendering calls in its main loop. It was surprisingly easy due to the game being written in java. However, I still couldn't run the game on cli because it required a window manager. And I wanted to automate the process without having to open up the desktop for all the worker nodes and manually traversing through the gui to launch the game. 

The solution for that problem proved to be deceptively simple. Just attach a command to the gnome-session-properties such that when it starts it automatically fires the game. Then, use ssh connection to open up a new gnome session, which can be done in cli or by a bash script. When things required a reset I could just close the gnome sessions which also can be done via cli and start it back up again.

That's about it!"

PhYsIcS-GUY227,MachineLearning,1619445711.0,"[P] Integrating Git, DVC, and MLflow into one","Hey r/MachineLearning. I'm one of the creators of [DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com), and I wanted to share something cool that we've been working on. DVC ([dvc.org](https://dvc.org)) and MLflow ([mlflow.org](https://mlflow.org)) are two open-source projects that are very widely adopted, each for its own specialty. DVC excels at data versioning, and MLflow is used for many things (it's actually multiple tools combined into one), but mainly for its experiment tracking capabilities. Both tools have a built-in tradeoff – since they are open source, setting up storage for DVC and a central tracking server for MLflow can be a pain – requiring you to create cloud accounts, add permissions, and more.

DAGsHub is already integrated with DVC, in the sense that whenever you create a project, it comes with a free, built-in, DVC remote.

Since last week, you also get a free MLflow server, which means you can log experiments directly to DAGsHub and share it with your team or colleagues.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/edvlu237xiv61.gif

Why I think this is awesome:

1. Zero setup – add your MLflow remote server URI and just log experiments
2. Access control built-in – if you have a team and some people need access only to view the experiments but not to log new ones, you can easily control that
3. Better UI for comparison – one of the complaints MLflow users have had was about the inability to compare runs across experiments in MLflow, with DAGsHub that is easily possible as all runs appear in a single list, which you can then filter to fit only a single experiment.
4. Integrating MLflow and DVC – a lot of people are working with both systems and building ad-hoc systems to integrate them, but with this integration, you can create a project that was built for this type of work, integrated with all the tools you need.

Here's a [more detailed blog post](https://dagshub.com/blog/launching-dagshub-integration-with-databricks-mlflow/) from the engineer that built this. I'd love to hear your thoughts about it."

temakone,MachineLearning,1617020121.0,[R] Swin Transformer: New SOTA backbone for Computer Vision🔥,"**Swin Transformer: New SOTA backbone for Computer Vision** 🔥*MS Research Asia*

# 👉 What?

New vision Transformer architecture called Swin Transformer that can serve as a backbone in computer vision instead of CNNs.

# ❓Why?

There are two main problems with the usage of Transformers for computer vision.

1. Existing Transformer-based models have tokens of a fixed scale. However, in contrast to the word tokens, visual elements can be different in scale (e.g. objects of varying sizes on the scene)
2. Regular self-attention requires quadratic of the image size number of operations, limiting applications in computer vision where high resolution is necessary (e.g., instance segmentation).

# 🥊 The main ideas of the Swin Transformers:

1. **Hierarchical feature maps** where at each level of hierarchy Self-attention is applied within local non-overlapping windows. The size of the windows is progressively increased with the network depth (inspired by CNNs). This enables building architectures similar to feature pyramid networks (FPN) or U-Net for dense pixel-level tasks.
2. **Window-based Self-attention** reduces the computational overhead.

# ⚙️ Overall Architecture consists of repeating the following blocks:

\- Split RGB image into non-overlapping patches (tokens).

\- Apply MLP to translate raw features into an arbitrary dimension.

\- Apply 2 consecutive Swin Transformer blocks with Window self-attention: **both blocks have the same window size, but the second block uses shifted by \`patch\_size/2\` windows which allows information flow between non-overlapping windows**.

\- Downsampling layer: Reduce the number of tokens by merging neighboring patches in a 2x2 window, and double the feature depth.

# 👌Conclusion

While Transformers are super flexible, researchers start to **inject in Transformers inductive biases similar to those in CNNs**, e.g., local connectivity, feature hierarchies. And this seems to help tremendously!

I'm working with a team of \~20 old school analysis folks (stats & natural science backgrounds), and we need to move out of our on-prem setup to Microsoft Azure.

We are a research team (not ML research, but domain specific research), and we are all used to our HPC: 

* we can ssh into it and connect VSCode to it.
* we can easily use dask to run distributed processing (via SLURM)
* we have a unix filesystem
* etc.

What is the best cloud setup for such teams? What do people do in research organizations in big tech companies?

* Give the DS team members freedom to run any compute instances they want?
* Run a pool of compute instances that the DS team can ssh into?
* Run a Kubernetes cluster using AKS?
* Use the Azure ML offering, even though we don't do much ML?
* Something else? We rely heavily on CLI tools and VSCode, so Jupyter-only solution is not an option for us.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated."
yusuf-bengio,MachineLearning,1616767299.0,[D] Dilemma: Mathematically wrong ICML submission got extremely good reviews,"I am tangentially involved in a ICML submission from a research group at a different institute. After the initial reviews, I realized that the main theorem, which the work is based on, is mathematically objectively wrong.

For anyone working in this subfield finding a counterexample that violates the theorem is pretty straightforward. However, none of the reviewers found an error with the theory, even praising the paper with high scores (definitely an accept).

As I was involved in this work only at the very beginning, e.g., for laying out the ideas and roadmap, I never thoroughly read the theoretical parts of the paper before the submission.

The proof exploits subtle differences of two definitions of a concept in older vs newer literature. Moreover, the final paper use of grandiose mathematical notation, making the error harder to spot. In my opinion, it even appears as if the choices of the mathematical writing style and the use of the conflicting definitions were made deliberately.

The problem though is that if I intervene now, the PI (who didn't read beyond the abstract) and the PhD student responsible for the proof (and known for having ""narcissistic"" tendencies) will be pissed. I don't want to risk my career, because the PI is quite a bigshot in the field and the student is extremely well connected to a FANG company (""best friends"" with a top-5 researcher there).

I was thinking that if I am quite about it, the worst thing that can happen is other researchers realizing the error and publishing a ""counter"" paper to disprove ours.

Furthermore, I have the feeling that I can't be the only one having this particular kind of dilemma. Does anyone have experiences with situations like mine?

**Update**:

Thank you for all the feedback on my situation.

As many suggested, I wrote up and discussed the counterexample with the co-authors. During our discussion I realized three things:

1. Coming up the the counterexample and seeing how it violates the main claims is not as straightforward as I original thought. It took even the student who wrote the proof quite a while to realize that there might be some issues.
2. The student and PI are both still convinced about the correctness of the main theoretical results, citing the good reviews as additional evidence that the claims are correct. Their main argument is that the proof uses primarily existing theorems from literature and (correct) reformulation of mathematical expressions. Thus, if there is something wrong with the claims, it must come from the theorems proven in the literature and be already wrong in there.
3. The submission will not be withdrawn from ICML, nor do the co-authors intend to change the paper."

NominalNom,MachineLearning,1619809526.0,[D] A recent history of my pointless stare down with Nvidia which I lost,"Just a quick, comical summary of my experience trying to get a GPU since just prior to the launch of the Ampere cards.

I work in film post production and I have no prior deep learning coding experience, but I wanted a GPU with a lot of memory to process high res imagery with an existing TensorFlow-based open source toolset that I could just about figure out how to use with my small amount of Python experience. I did secure a Titan RTX off Amazon(!) at retail price, but I decided to return it when I found out about the imminent release of the Ampere cards because $1500 sounded a lot better than $2500.

Of course, the 3090 is going for around the same price as the 2.5k rrp I paid for the RTX Titan. I was very naive at that exact moment about the fact that crypto mining was going to go back into full swing, although I was warned by someone on this very sub. I did expect Eth proof of stake to cancel some of that out, but we aren't there yet.

Besides availability issues, there was also the size of the 3090 which Nvidia seem to have intentionaly made huge so it can't fit in a typical deep learning rig or graphics workstation. No problem, I'll get a third party blower card - if I can find one in stock. Whoops, now Nvidia killed them all!

Alright, now I'll look at one of those rinky-dink third party RGB gamer cards that are sufficiently low profile - I only need one card with 24GB VRAM. Okay, they are all sold out forever and if you can get one, it may be as expensive as the previous Titan.

So maybe it's best to get an A5000 or A6000, because tbh it seems they are more likely to go for RRP which makes them not a huge step up from the inflated 3090 prices and they are better supported on Linux IMO.

I have just found out about the LHR cards though, that will be shipping soon. But also that there may not be a 3090 LHR, so it doesn't seem like supply will necessarily improve.

There is now a proprietary GUI-based toolset by the same developers which is now using PyTorch as the back end. But it's still recommended that 24GB is where you really want to be at memory-wise without needing to slice up the input images too much, so this issue is not going anywhere. I had managed to get a 2060 Super with 8GB as an interim card which is really the bare minimum. It's also comical how much those cards are going for now, so I'm glad I snagged one of the last ones at Best Buy for $400 RRP last year."

By using GloVe to obtain synonyms, we have enhanced the Boolean Bag-of-Words used by Tsetlin Machines in NLP. The added synonyms help the Tsetlin Machine produce fewer and semantically more powerful rules, while boosting accuracy by up to 4%. This makes the transparent and interpretable rules more competitive with deep learning-based NLP models.

cents_less,MachineLearning,1618511530.0,[P] Announcing Feast 0.10: The simplest way to serve features in production,"Hey folks!

Over the last two years we’ve been working on an open source feature store called Feast. The idea behind Feast is that it helps you to operationalize your features. Meaning it helps you build training datasets from your offline features, it helps you load features into an online store in a structured way, and it provides low latency access to your features in production.

The original design of Feast was heavy weight. You needed to run a big stack on Kubernetes with Spark. We’ve been chatting to a bunch of users and the one thing we kept hearing was that they saw value in Feast for productionizing their data, but it was too heavy weight to own.

So we’ve put a lot of energy towards really simplifying Feast. We’ve made it as easy as a pip install. You can now run Feast locally if you’re just getting started with development/testing, but you can also deploy it to cloud providers like GCP if you want something more scalable.

We’d love for you to download it and try it out in your own projects. We’ve got a slack workspace you can join to get involved and ask questions. Also we wouldn’t hate a star on Github either 😉

ottawalanguages,MachineLearning,1618970325.0,"[D] ""no free lunch"" vs neural networks","I read that there is a theorem called ""the no free lunch theorem"" that states : there is no single algorithm that is better than all other algorithms. This is somewhat obvious: complex algorithms should perform better on complex problems, and simpler algorithms should perform better on simpler problems. 

This being said, why have neural network based algorithms been accepted as the main type of algorithms for solving complex real-world problems? Apart from the simple answer, that they ""from observation, they simply perform better on these problems"" - if we were to look at neural networks (e.g. mlp, lstm, cnn), reffering to the mathematical properties of neural networks, how/what could we attribute their success to? Why do we use neural  networks instead of regression models? From a certain prespective, are neural networks defying the ""no free lunch theorem""?"

ancientmooner,MachineLearning,1616904933.0,[R] Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows,"Transformers make the previously saturated COCO and ADE20K benchmarks unblocked again. It creates a new SOTA on COCO and ADE20K:

[COCO det](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/object-detection-on-coco): 58.7 mAP (`+2.7 mAP`)

[COCO inst](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/instance-segmentation-on-coco): 51.1 mAP (`+2.6 mAP`)

[ADE seg](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/semantic-segmentation-on-ade20k-val):  53.5 mIoU (`+3.2 mIoU`)

This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (86.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones.

This recently published work on self-supervised learning is based on a simple idea yet yield amazing results. I liked reading the paper and got interested to read more about Barlow's redundancy concept from neuroscience.

An interesting fact which I came across is that Barlow himself in a publication back in 2000 revisited his opinion about the redundancy reduction.

Learning biological properties from sequence data is a logical step toward generative and predictive artificial intelligence for biology. Here, we propose scaling a deep contextual language model with unsupervised learning to sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. We find that without prior knowledge, information emerges in the learned representations on fundamental properties of proteins such as secondary structure, contacts, and biological activity. We show the learned representations are useful across benchmarks for remote homology detection, prediction of secondary structure, long-range residue–residue contacts, and mutational effect. Unsupervised representation learning enables state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improves state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.

*Abstract*

In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.

Artistic-Mushroom974,MachineLearning,1617240597.0,[d] Robotics/ AI PhD Salary Expectations for T1.5 School," I'm a junior (first few years) PhD student in Robotics/AI at GTech (CS Rankings for AI/Robotics puts GTech at #6 in the US [http://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&robotics&us](http://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&robotics&us)) . I've seen posts about 250-300k total comp post ML/AI PhD's at big tech or in fintech, but I've also seen some caveats like only for top 4 (MIT/Stanford/CMU/Berkeley) school PhDs. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/bwwmh9/d\_doing\_a\_phd\_is\_not\_worth\_it\_unless\_exception/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/bwwmh9/d_doing_a_phd_is_not_worth_it_unless_exception/))

So my question is, what is a realistic salary expectations for the next couple schools after the top 4? Are they that much worse than ""top 4?"" Do I still have good prospects of a 250-300k offer (what would be a low, mid, and high range)? Also, what are my prospects if I were to take the Master's rather than finish the full degree?

For context, many labs at my school have a fair (but not outstanding) amount of top conference publications (ICLR,NeurIPS,ICML, CoRL, ICRA).

And no, money is not the only reason I chose this route (I have a lot of curiosity as to the possibilities of AI), but it is demanding and difficult work."
_Arsenie_Boca_,MachineLearning,1620455301.0,[D] Worth learning JAX?,"Recently, more popular papers as ViT start using JAX to implement their models. I mainly use PyTorch but in the past I was playing with the thought of learning tensorflow. I always felt like tensorflow has a lot of legacy code and conventions that make it kinda unneccessarily complicated compared to pytorch.

1. Now that google seems to shift to JAX internally, do you think JAX will replace tensorflow? 
2. And regardless of that, is it worth learning JAX? 
3. If you would learn JAX, which higher-level api  (comparable to torch.nn) would you use like stax, flax, haiku?"
memgamemotron,MachineLearning,1617048073.0,[P] Need help figuring out how to print out the sentence and sentence predictions from my google trax neural network model.,"so to begin with, this is a project I am helping my school with to gain experience.  I have taken plenty of [deeplearning.AI](https://deeplearning.AI) courses which helped me build this codes foundation. 

The data is from a chat bot which provides the chat text, ANGRY labels and HAPPY labels which were going to feed into the model.

As you can see this model is performing at 67%, The following is the code that I need help with. I am trying to print the observed sentence followed by the prediction. I have tried to do it but am not getting 2 output prediction for ANGRY and HAPPY labels. 

The purpose is to help understand if a customer is either angry or happy with the bot customer experience and also identify if interference is needed from an agent.

WigglyHypersurface,MachineLearning,1620230052.0,[D] Making sense of this autoencoder archetecture,"I'm looking to implement the architecture from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02382.pdf) for imputing some missing data. I'm confused on a couple of points about the choices made. 

Rather than an encoder/decoder setup, this autoencoder adds an extra generator network. I'm having some trouble parsing why this is necessary or desirable though. Also, I'm confused about what the input to the generator is. Is the input just noise and the mask? Also, how the inputs to the encoder are handled when they are missing, i.e. do they just replace the NAs with zero?

If I'm understanding correctly, in the missing data imputation case the mask is just used by the loss function to zero out the log-likelihood values for the data that are missing. Is that correct?

It seems like it would be simpler to have a standard encoder/decoder setup, and just initialize by filling in the missing data with random values, then resample a prediction for each missing value at the end of each epoch and keep training, with the log-likelihood for the missing values masked out. That way you wouldn't need the mask as an additional input to the encoder/generator."

The SSL-HPT algorithm estimates hyperparameters 6-20x faster when compared with baseline (search-based) algorithms, producing accurate forecasting results in numerous applications.

At present, Forecasting is one of the significant data science and machine learning tasks performed. Therefore, it is crucial to have fast, reliable, and accurate forecasting results with large amounts of time series data for managing various businesses. 

Time series analysis is used to find trends and forecast future values. A slight difference in hyperparameters in this type of analysis could lead to very different forecast results for a given model and have serious consequences. Therefore, it’s essential to select optimal hyperparameter values.

Lunavahid,MachineLearning,1620639107.0,[Vault] [Discussion] Is Human in the Loop the New Thing?,"  

&#x200B;

Recent discussion around AI and ethics goes all the way to one concept. Do we need humans in the AI pipeline loop or not? Even some CEOs declared they are worried about the fact that AI can push people perception, judgment and eventually make them biased. 

So the ultimate question is doing we need humans in the loop or not. Do we need them to surprise algorithms, analyses outcomes and results, check for hidden biases and find potential pitfalls? (and even to find those patterns we might use another AI system). 

New frontiers in AI need more data to perform better. More data and better algorithms are the recipe of success of several new achievements. 

Let's look at one application that we are familiar with. Annotation and tagging. 

Image Annotation has never been this accessible. There are billions of images, texts, audio and videos. Annotation and tagging provide a solid learning background for AIA systems to learn. 20 year ago the challenge was to recognize an apple, or the number 8 or the letter ""Z"". The new challenge is to identify a Spanish house on a sunny day next to a lake. 

The more sophistication needed form users means more sophisticated annotation and tagging for learning purposes. More sophistication means more labels and annotation and for that reason the need to the human in the loop is increasing."

The logic really fails when you try building something bigger and better though. If you have a styleGAN for example, you have to understand what the optimisation process is like. You need to know what people use batch norm for etc etc. It is impossible to understand the code otherwise.

&#x200B;

And even then, with very similar projects, I found myself able to apprach it 100x times better after doing a simple [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) course.

&#x200B;

Sure, you could cheat your way to a project that sounds sexy to a novice that knows nothing about ML. But have you learned anything if you use tf.nn everywhere and find usable results? I am not that sure really."

dcpyro,MachineLearning,1616358255.0,[D] Is my idea of a Feature Store wrong?,"Should a Feature Store be part of an enterprise data catalog?

To me, a feature store seems to be a highly niche data catalog but  missing a lot of the benefits of having an enterprise data catalog /  data discovery tool. My need is to have generated features discoverable  when searching for data.

For example, if I have dataset A and B used to generate a feature set  AB', I would want to know about that information if I search and ever  come across dataset A or B in my data catalog.

Along with that, it would be beneficial to have the code / git commit that generated the features.

Am I missing something?"

Seankala,MachineLearning,1616906465.0,[D] Not able to reproduce SoTA baseline results due to (assumed) package mismatch. How should I go about this?,"Hi. I'm a student working on a research project. There's a SoTA baseline model that I have managed to run, but unfortunately the performance is quite a bit lower than that reported in the paper. Searching around the closed issues in GitHub has led me to believe that it may probably be due to a package version mismatch.

Unfortunately the package that the original implementers used is a relatively older version, and in order to install it I believe I'd have to downgrade many of the drivers in the server I'm currently using to run my experiments.

What would your advice be to someone in my shoes? This is my first actual project so I'm not sure how to proceed. Should I just use these results with a disclaimer, or should I do whatever I can to achieve the original performances first?

Thanks."

Smart brain implants will revolutionize neurotechnology for improving the quality of life in patients with brain disorders. The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) with neural implants for deep brain stimulation presents an avenue for developing machine-learning based individualized treatments to refine human motor control. We developed an optimized movement decoding approach to predict grip-force based on sensorimotor electrocorticography and subthalamic local field potentials in PD. We demonstrate that electrocorticography combined with Bayesian optimized extreme gradient boosted decision trees outperform other machine learning approaches. We elucidate a link between dopamine and movement coding capacity in PD, by showing negative correlations between decoding performance and motor symptom severity in the medication OFF state. Finally, we introduce an approach that leverages wholebrain connectomics to predict machine-learning based decoding performance in invasive neurophysiology. Our study provides a framework to aid development of intelligent adaptive deep brain stimulation."

StellaAthena,MachineLearning,1616370695.0,[P] EleutherAI releases 1.3B and 2.7B GPT-3-style models trained on the Pile,"The [GPT-Neo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo/) project by [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) has released 1.3B and 2.7B parameter GPT-3-style models. The models are trained on [the Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai), a 800 GB curated dataset EleutherAI released in January.

The release includes:

1. The full modeling code, written in Mesh TensorFlow and designed to be run on TPUs.
2. Trained model weights.
3. Optimizer states, which allow you to continue training the model from where EAI left off.
4. A [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EleutherAI/GPTNeo/blob/master/GPTNeo_example_notebook.ipynb) that shows you how to use the code base to train, fine-tune, and sample from a model.

Before people inevitably get confused, **this is not the same size as GPT-3**. The 1.3B model is a little smaller than GPT-2, and then 2.7B model is about twice as big. GPT-3 comes in a variety of sizes, including 1.3B and 2.7B (which is why we chose those values too). The ""full"" GPT-3 model is 175B parameters.

**Edit:** We've gotten a couple questions about this in Discord, so I wanted to share the following here as well. To the best of my knowledge this is a complete list of all announced autoregressive, non-MoE transformers. A model is considered public if anyone can download the trained model weights for free. No, it's not a typo that I say Facebook has trained a Megatron LM model, you can find the weights [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/megatron_11b).

,MachineLearning,1617032593.0,[P] NeMo Getting Started. Prototyping Conversational AI Application,"Hey all!  Hope everyone is having a great Monday, I know I am. I want to let everyone know about a NVIDIA AI platform piece I use daily, NeMo. 

[NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is a toolkit for building new State-of-the-Art Conversational AI models. NeMo has separate collections for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) models. Each collection consists of prebuilt modules that include everything needed to train on your data. Every module can easily be customized, extended, and composed to create new Conversational AI model architectures.

Conversational AI architectures are typically large and require a lot of data and compute for training. NeMo uses PyTorch Lightning for easy and performant multi-GPU/multi-node mixed-precision training.

[Cool collab notebook for getting started with NeMo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/r1.0.0rc1/tutorials/NeMo_Getting_Started.ipynb) shows how we can construct a toy demo showing the ability to translate Russian audio files into English. That's what is so neat about NeMo is the pipeline is so diverse; we can translate these audio files into English, then if we wanted to, use BERT for the NLP task for the translated English as well. And so on and so on.   


Anyways, I hope you enjoy this collab book, and to have a poke around NeMo afterwards."

ilikepancakez,MachineLearning,1618773529.0,[D] Neural Nets (1994),"[https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/plan02.html](https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/plan02.html)

I was in college and interested in neural nets when this was written, and as it happens later graduated and worked with the author of this post. In academia at the time, I believe neural nets were seen as a fading trend, something that was a cute idea but wasn’t destined to work out because they didn’t work well enough and even if they did we didn’t have the compute for anything useful. Personally, I was fascinated, and I know several other people who kept hope as well, one who is now quite a well known AI / neural nets researcher. I didn’t pursue neural nets personally, but I did keep using related genetic algorithms and artificial evolution, which I think was viewed with the same mix of skepticism generally, with pockets of enthusiasts. Gates in the story was probably sharing what he’d been hearing from academics. Lawrence (author of the post) is an incredibly smart person, and I have no doubt was able to see past what many of the researchers were saying.

BTW, I recently happened across a [paper from 1967](http://pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~edouard.thiel/rech/1967-blum.pdf) (53 years ago) that mentions neural networks in passing as if it was a popular idea at the time - the original paper on the Medial Axis Transform! Scroll to the 2nd page (“364”) near the top: “Consider a continuous isotropic plane (an idealization of an active granular material or a rudimentary neural net) that has the following properties at each point”"
IborkedyourGPU,MachineLearning,1618497148.0,[D] MLFlow vs ClearML vs Gradient Paperspace,"The MLOps tools scene is slightly overcrowded (\s). I want to limit the comparison to the three tools in the subject. Requirements:

 - run on-prem (we've got our own hardware, don't need/want cloud)
 - easily launch experiments. 
 - experiment database: log metrics, create plots, compare different experiments visually, track model performance over time
 - easy to install and use. Setting up some experiment trackers require a level of DevOp savvy that many data science teams don’t have, so that's a no-no.

Nice-to-have:
 - deploy models as API endpoints. We can use Docker for this, so this isn't really crucial, but...it's a nice-to-have.
 - hyperparameter tuning. It's fine if hyperparameter tuning relies on some third-party plugin, as long as it's open source (for example, MLFlow + Hydra + Ax plugin should be able to handle hyperparameter tuning through Bayesian Optimization just fine).
 - open source. AFAIK, MLFlow & ClearML are open source, while Gradient is not.

How do MLFlow, ClearML and Gradient compare in these respects? I'm especially interested in the comparison between MLFlow & ClearML - from my point of view as an outsider, they seem pretty similar, but I could be wrong, ofc.

Megixist,MachineLearning,1619071095.0,[P] Implementation of MADGRAD optimization algorithm for Tensorflow,"I am pleased to present a Tensorflow implementation of the MADGRAD optimization algorithm, which was published by Facebook AI in their paper [Adaptivity without Compromise: A Momentumized, Adaptive, Dual Averaged Gradient Method for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11075v2.pdf) (Aaron Defazio and Samy Jelassi, 2021). When this algorithm was first introduced, several people requested that it be implemented in tf.keras, so I decided to do so. This implementation's main features include:

1. Simple integration into every tf.keras model: Since the MadGrad subclass derives from the      OptimizerV2 superclass, it can be used in the same way as any other tf.keras optimizer.
2. Built-in weight decay support.
3. Full Learning Rate scheduler support.
4. Complete support for sparse vector backpropagation.
5. Available on PyPi so you can install and import it directly.

I personally feel its REALLY important to write good, clear, modular and reusable code, but at the same time the fast moving nature of ML (in academia at least, dunno in industry) pushes you to get an MVP (minimum viable product, in this case, a model with results) as fast as possible, making it hard to think about what or how should things be done in advance.

We actually can solve it with DQN. However, the bottle-neck is that the Agent only picks one node at each step. With a large N, it may make the runtime increase. Does anyone know any possible RL method that the agent can pick multiple nodes (more than one node) at each step? Thanks a lot."

SomeParanoidAndroid,MachineLearning,1617702239.0,[D] Choosing ML + numerical computations workstation/server,"I am starting my PhD in machine learning in a newly established lab that is mainly focused on wireless communications and I have been tasked with finding an server/workstation to get for the office. My budget is around $3500-$4500. 

I of course will be utilizing the GPU to train models, but part of my work involves running numerical simulations, optimization algorithms, physical models, this sort of stuff. The rest of the (2-4) people will be dealing with the latter stuff exclusively.

Also, while I write all of my code in python using numba and tensorflow, the others will be using MATLAB. A final constraint is that we are based in Europe and my supervisor is skeptical about ordering from the US or abroad in general due to delivery times and extra complexity. So I would ideally like something that is generally available from suppliers anywhere (no LambdaLabs or System 76 unfortunately :/ ). 

Considering that we will all be probably needing the server concurrently and that our code usually takes several hours, what parts should I be prioritizing? Especially:

* I am thinking of getting an RTX 3080  (seems one of the best VFM GPUs for DL)
* i9/Ryzen or Xeon? supposedly Xeons are able to handle multiple jobs better and stay on without problems longer, but they look WAY slower. I see that they support ECC memory which I don't know if it has any relevance to our field. Also, most of our code could use a good CPU. **\[This is my most important dilemma\]** 
* Would 32GB RAM be enough? I would like to get 64GB, but it may be out of budget. Do you think I should prioritize this?
* Is liquid cooling needed? The server will be placed in our office.
* Does a dual GPU setup make sense? (e.g. 2x 3070) It seems ridiculous to spend such a huge portion of the budget when I have to account for everyone.

Plus some other more general questions/discussion points:

* ""Gaming"" pc as a workstation? If we opt for the i9, some alienware configurations hit the specs spot on. Should I avoid them? **\[I would appreciate opinions on this too\]**
* Are ""workstation solutions for deep learning"" from companies like IBM, Lenovo, HP, e.t.c. in this price range out of touch with reality? They offer some setups with 8GB ram, P1000 with 4GB VRAM (RTX 4000 is the closest to the 30 series I can find) and so on... For the same budget I could have a dream setup from Lambda Labs or something equivalent.
* Linux vs Windows? I feel way more comfortable on the former and I kind of fear that windows will just get in the way unnecessarily.
* MATLAB does support running code remotely, right?"
bendee983,MachineLearning,1617032735.0,[D] Algorithms Are Not Enough,"""Algorithms Are Not Enough"" provides a fresh perspective on the shortcomings of current AI systems.

The main idea discussed in AANE is that current AI systems are heavily dependent on representations. A human engineer must discover a problem and simplify the solution into distinct steps, a set of input data and expected outcomes, or a set of rewards and actions. Only then can an AI algorithm be designed to solve that problem. What we're lacking is not algorithms that can solve complicated problems but algorithms that can seek out and discover new problems and develop their solutions without help from humans.

latticeprep,MachineLearning,1617339115.0,[D] How does stripe use GBT's to find edge similarity?,"I'm reading Stripe's [blog post on how it finds similar accounts to flag fraudulent activity](https://stripe.com/blog/similarity-clustering) and it just doesn't make any sense to me. I'm wondering if anyone has any idea on how GBT's can be used on adjacency lists like this.

From the post:

>Over the years, our risk underwriting teams have manually compiled many examples of existing clusters of fraudulent accounts through our investigations of fraud rings, and we can use these reference clusters as training data to learn our similarity function. By sampling edges from these groups, we obtain a dataset consisting of pairs of accounts along with a label for each pair indicating whether or not the two accounts belong to the same cluster. We use intra-cluster edges as positive training examples and inter-cluster edges as negative training examples, where an edge denotes a pair of accounts.  
>  
>Because of the wide variety of features we can construct from given pairs of accounts, we decided to use [gradient-boosted decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) (GBDTs) to represent our similarity model. In practice, we’ve found GBDTs strike the right balance between being easy to train, having strong predictive power and being robust despite variations in the data. When we started this project we wanted to get something out the door quickly that was effective, had well-understood properties, and was straightforward to fine-tune. The variant that we use, [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), is one of the best performing off-the-shelf models for cases with structured (also known as tabular) data, and we have well-developed infrastructure to train and serve them. You can read more about the infrastructure we use to [train machine learning models](https://stripe.com/en-ca/blog/railyard-training-models) at Stripe in a previous post.  
>  
>Now that we have a trained model, we can use it to predict fraudulent activity. Since this model operates on pairs of Stripe accounts, it’s not feasible to feed it all possible pairs of accounts and compute scores across all pairs. Instead, we first generate a candidate set of edges to be scored. We do this by taking recently created Stripe accounts and creating edges between accounts that share certain attributes. Although this isn’t an exhaustive approach, this heuristic works well in practice to prune the set of candidate edges to a reasonable number.  
>  
>Once the candidate edges are scored, we then filter edges by selecting those with a similarity score above some threshold. We then compute the connected components on the resulting graph. The final output is a set of high-fidelity account clusters which we can analyze, process, or manually inspect together as a unit. In particular, a fraud analyst may want to examine clusters which contain known fraudulent accounts and investigate the remaining accounts in that cluster.  
>  
>This is an iterative process; as each individual cluster grows, we can quickly identify increasing similarity as fake accounts in a fraudster’s operation are created. And the more fraud rings we detect and shutdown at Stripe, the more accurate our clustering model becomes at identifying new clusters in the future.

I found this baffling. I didn't realize GBTs could be used to effectively find cliques in a graph. Has anyone tried this or understand how it works better? I don't really understand how these edge candidates are scored against past known-fraudulent edges. I just don't have a sense of the feature space for this at all."

pianomano8,MachineLearning,1619197053.0,[R] MLC@Home and MLDS: A Dataset for Weight-Space Analysis of Neural Networks,"# Announcing MLC@Home and MLDS!

***tl;dr:***

Project website: [https://www.mlcathome.org](https://www.mlcathome.org)  
Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10555](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10555)

***MLC@Home***

MLC@Home is a volunteer-based distributed computing project dedicated to understanding and explaining machine learning models, specifically neural networks.  It's a collaborative project hosted at [UMBC](https://www.umbc.edu/).  Since July 2020, thousands of volunteers have been training neural networks on their home computers when otherwise idle (using [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/),  the same framework as SETI@Home).  The project is less about chasing SotA, and more about understanding how networks encode the data that they do via inspection.  MLC@Home is also the first ML-focussed project to use BOINC framework.

***MLDS: Machine learning Dataset Generator***

Since July 2020, volunteers have been crunching away creating MLDS, a dataset of hundreds of thousands (on our way to ***1.1 million***) neural networks with a small selection of shapes, leaving only the weight space variable. We've [released](https://www.mlcathome.org/mlds.html) a few early versions of this dataset to the public, and commit to making the entire dataset available when complete. This past week, we posted our preliminary findings based on this dataset to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10555).  A summary of the preliminary findings in the paper:

* Given enough samples, identically shaped neural networks trained with different training data show clustering behavior in weight space
* We  can classify which networks were trained with which dataset with high accuracy
* We were able to differentiate most networks trained with backdoor/adversarial data versus those trained with clean data

We believe this is the largest publicly-available dataset dedicated to weight space analysis, by at least an order of magnitude, and we're still growing. The dataset leads to all sorts of interesting questions and possibilities to evaluate networks via direct inspection of the weights and structure of a network itself, as opposed to indirect measures of performance such as observed loss on test data.   

MLDS also captures meta information about the training process, such as loss history, what hardware the network was trained on (windows/llinux, amd64/arm64/arm32, cpu/cuda/rocm), and timing information, allowing even more opportunities for comparison. 

***Next Steps***

MLDS  continues to expand the MLDS dataset.  Currently, the dataset consists of small RNNs (200,000 parameters or less), but we're adding support for CNNs currently and have plans to support transformers and arbitrarily-sized networks.  MLDS will continue to grow and be a useful resource for the community. 

MLC@Home has even larger goals.  Leveraging volunteer computing is a capability multiplier for many lines of research.  MLC@Home can support multiple projects at once, and MLDS is just the first.  While MLC@Home will likely never outperform a tightly-coupled cluster for training a single large network, we foresee MLC@Home being useful for:

* Dataset generation (such as MLDS)
* Reproducibility / Robustness studies
* Architecture and Hyperparameter search
* Neuro-evolution

.. just to name a few.  Our community has contributions over 8000 computers, and more joining every day. 

***Interested and/or*** ***Want to help?***

MLC@Home is actively seeing collaborators!

**Individual contributors**

Have a computer? You can help  MLC@Home! Instructions for installing the client and joining are available on our website. 

**Researchers**

MLC@Home is actively looking for research collaborators! If you're interested in weight-space meta analysis and want to talk further about MLDS and how it can be improved; ***or*** if you have a new project idea that could benefit from the generosity of MLC@Home's volunteers,  please each out to us via email/twitter/discord, we'd love to collaborate!  

**Developers / Data Science Engineers**

Running a project that has to support cutting-edge and legacy hardware on multiple platforms is not easy. If you're a software developer or data science engineer and would like to help, please let us know.  Our client is open source, written in C++, and uses the PyTorch C++ API for most computation. We have specific needs for an OSX developer to port the client to Mac platforms, and many enhancements to make overall.  Our website could also use some updating. 

***Summary***

We're very excited about the possibilities of MLC@Home, and these past 9 months have made it a real, useful and growing resource. We'd love community feedback and collaborators to make it grow in new and fun ways.  As always, thanks to our volunteers who make is all possible.. without them, we never would have gotten off the ground.

[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kvfrans/status/1379925309311442944)

Basic Idea:
Neural CAs define local interactions which together grow into a global design. Instead of one system for one design, we can define a general system which grows *many* designs. This lets us condition our neural CA by giving it different design-specific ""seeds"".

StampCA models encode design-specific information in the cell state, and generic information in the network parameters. This means we can 1. grow many designs without retraining, and 2. grow all these designs in the same world.

We can also train GAN-based StampCAs. This model can use random values as a seed, and grows into various MNIST-like digits.

The authors mentioned in the paper that 

> *Shuffling BN. Our encoders fq and fk both have Batch Normalization (BN) \[37\] as in the standard ResNet \[33\]. In experiments, we found that using BN prevents the model from learning good representations, as similarly reported in \[35\] (which avoids using BN). The model appears to “cheat” the pretext task and easily finds a low-loss solution. This is possibly because the intra-batch communication among samples (caused by BN) leaks information. We resolve this problem by shuffling BN. We train with multiple GPUs and perform BN on the samples independently for each GPU (as done in common practice). For the key encoder fk, we shuffle the sample order in the current mini-batch before distributing it among GPUs (and shuffle back after encoding); the sample order of the mini-batch for the query encoder fq is not altered. This ensures the batch statistics used to compute a query and its positive key come from two different subsets. This effectively tackles the cheating issue and allows training to benefit from BN. We use shuffled BN in both our method and its end-to end ablation counterpart (Figure 2a). It is irrelevant to the memory bank counterpart (Figure 2b), which does not suffer from this issue because the positive keys are from different mini-batches in the past.* 

I was unable to understand that what type of information is leaked due to intra-batch communication. Please can someone help in understanding this point or refer to some source?

Ingvariuss,MachineLearning,1620406896.0,[D] Data Collection Crowdsourcing - How to animate people?,"Hello,

I started working on an ambitious AI project that would advance a specific field in psychology. The thing with this project is that it needs much data and doing it myself would take me around 4 years if I'd be collecting it on a consistent basis.

The idea was for the community, which is quite alive, to help me out collect some data and I wrote thorough documentation with the project description, rules of data formating and collecting, and have even made a little website that does most of the work for them where they basically need to copy/paste stuff and check some boxes.

I gave the documentation to two of my friends to read and see if everything is sound, after getting a green light I shared the document around in various social media channels. A big chunk of people ran away because the documentation was long while others, out of fear, started attacking the idea of using AI. After some conversation with them, I've concluded that they have no idea about how AI modeling works, what it can and can't do, or what goes under the hood. Which is fine as their backgrounds are colorful.

Teaching them all about AI and how it works and why do I need the data in that format isn't an option as most of them are ignorant.

I haven’t used C# since ~2014 so reading the code is a bit difficult, but it’s part of the FastTree library and is clearly a tree-based implementation. I tested it with a simple `y ~ sin(x)` model and it was dreadful (the FastForest regressor is much better).

ottawalanguages,MachineLearning,1620111466.0,[D] Inevitable Manual Work Required in Machine Learning Projects,"I have feeling that not many people are willing to admit - but ultimately, is a significant part of many data mining projects (e.g. checking data quality, parsing through data, etc.) still done manually? 

For example here is an example I just made up relating to Supervised NLP (Natural Language Processing) Classification : Suppose I have 1000 medical reports of patients, containing unstructured text made by a doctor during a hospital visit. For a given patient, each report contains all the text notes that the doctor made for that patient, for visits between 2010 and 2020. These reports make mention of the patients bio data (e.g. age, gender, medical history, etc.) and the details of the symptoms that the patient is experiencing over a long period of time (e.g. let's say that these reports are 2000 words on average). The problem is, different doctors have different styles of writing - each of these 1000 reports is different from another. If a human were to read the report, the human could figure out what happened to the patient - did the patient have a serious condition (let's call this ""class 1"") or a non-serious condition (let's call this ""class 0""). This is what we are interested in predicting for future patients based on the limited medical notes made by doctors for these future patients. 

The problem is - there is no clear and fast way (not that I know of) to take the 1000 medical reports that are available, and label each report as ""class 1"" or ""class 0"". For example, for ""class 0"" : one of the doctors could clearly write at the end of a report ""all medical tests were conducted and the results and were all negative"", and another doctor could end the report by saying ""the patient should seriously consider changing their lifestyle and eat healthier food. benign."" . 

In this example, how would someone assign labels to all these 1000 cases, without manually reading them and deciding if the information in the report corresponds to a ""serious condition"" or a ""non-serious condition""? I was thinking of using something like ""sentiment analysis"" to capture the ""mood"" of these reports, and use sentiment analysis a method to informally gauge if the tone of the report is ""dark"" (serious condition) or ""light"" (non serious condition). But I am not sure if this is the best way to approach this problem. Is there a way to do this without reading all the reports and manually deciding labels?

In the end - this is what I am interested in doing : suppose a new patient comes in and on the first visit, the doctor makes some quick notes (e.g. patient is male, 30 years old, 180 cm, 100 kg, non-smoker, frequently complains of chest pains, no high blood pressure, works a construction worker and takes daily medicine for acid reflex). Just based on these quick notes and the 1000 reports available (NOTE: I am trying to illustrate a point here, that the medical notes for the new patient and the 1000 reports DO NOT have the same format), can a researcher predict (supervised classification, e.g. decision tree) if this patient will have a ""serious"" or a ""non-serious"" condition?

PS: suppose the doctors have a very detailed medical encyclopedia on their computers - can this medical encyclopedia be used alongside the 1000 medical reports to improve the prediction results?"
Ingvariuss,MachineLearning,1619513497.0,[P][D] NLP question - Question Answering AI,"Hey people,

I'm working on my personal project which will be quite a challenge. One of its features is that the user can interact with an ""Open-domain question answering"" chatbot which will be trained on the data I provide it.

I want the model to resemble a specific person/group and it will be fed everything that that person/group wrote, said and etc. Have in mind that the model can answer questions in 1-4 sentences and it doesn't need to be based on pure facts. This means that the user won't ask the model questions like ""What is the capital of France?"" but more something along the lines of existential questions (""What is the meaning of Life?"").

Here are the questions I have as I didn't dabble into the NLP world of AI at all:

1. Are there any pre-trained or prebuilt models out there that I could use for this? I've found that the open-source Pavlov AI library has some interesting ones.
2. Which models would suit this task the best?
3. Are there any features I should watch out for or provide more information on?

The biggest part of the job will be to collect relevant data on the group I want the model to resemble. What would be some of the best practices when making the data as informative as it can be? Also, if I want there to be 4 groups that the model can resemble - Do I need to train 4 models or can I filter what a model learned into 4 categories?

Thanks for all replies and questions in advance. If some of you are interested more in the project feel free to send a dm and we could even collaborate on this part of the project to make the model great."

_Arsenie_Boca_,MachineLearning,1620480658.0,[D] Multiple fine-tuning steps order,"When trying to maximize performance on a target task, transfer learning can not only be applied by fine-tuning a pretrained model on this task, but one might also want to incorporate several fine-tuning steps, that specialize the model to the target task. This is called (domain)-adaptive and behavorial fine-tuning (terminology see [here](https://ruder.io/recent-advances-lm-fine-tuning/)) depending on whether the data shares a domain or task setting with the target task. 

This is probably especially helpful in settings where the amount of labelled data for the specific target task is limited and the domain is significantly different from the pretraining data (e.g. [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.740.pdf) related to adapting via language modeling).

The fine-tuning steps might contain

* domain adaptation via language modeling
* task adaptation via the same task setting as the target task from a different domain
* task adaptation via the same task setting as the target task from a similar domain
* the target task itself

Now, when applying several of those fine-tuning / adaptation steps, how would one choose their order? Empirically testing all possible orders might not be feasible and a ""wrong"" order might make the model forget valuable skills/knowledge. 

My intuition would roughly be the order listed above with the reasoning that ordering ascendingly with the similarity to the target task will lead to the best model.

Is there a rule of thumb? Any literature investigating this or at least applying and briefly discussing it?"

**Abstract:**

Deep Learning has revolutionized our ability to solve complex problems such as Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). This task requires the agent to navigate to a goal purely based on visual sensory inputs given natural language instructions. However, prior works formulate the problem as a navigation graph with a discrete action space. In this work, we lift the agent off the navigation graph and propose a more complex VLN setting in continuous 3D reconstructed environments. Our proposed setting, Robo-VLN, more closely mimics the challenges of real world navigation. Robo-VLN tasks have longer trajectory lengths, continuous action spaces, and challenges such as obstacles. We provide a suite of baselines inspired by state-of-the-art works in discrete VLN and show that they are less effective at this task. We further propose that decomposing the task into specialized high- and low-level policies can more effectively tackle this task. With extensive experiments, we show that by using layered decision making, modularized training, and decoupling reasoning and imitation, our proposed Hierarchical Cross-Modal (HCM) agent outperforms existing baselines in all key metrics and sets a new benchmark for Robo-VLN."

This allows the algorithm to not only select the best set of features but also select the **best set of features that play well with each other**. For example, the best performing feature might not play well with others while the remaining features, when taken together could out-perform the best feature. PyImpetus takes this into account and produces the best possible combination. Thus, the algorithm provides a minimal feature subset. So, **you do not have to decide on how many features to take. PyImpetus selects the optimal set for you.**

PyImpetus has been completely revamped and now supports **binary classification, multi-class classification and regression** tasks. It has been tested on 14 datasets and outperformed state-of-the-art Markov Blanket learning algorithms on all of them along with traditional feature selection algorithms such as Forward Feature Selection, Backward Feature Elimination and Recursive Feature Elimination.

chasep255,MachineLearning,1620298405.0,[D] Learning a discrete encoding for raw audio.,"I have been working on various ways to generate music using neural nets.  I started with a WGAN using 1D convs which produced not the best results. I would really like to use an RNN to generate audio just like how you would generate text by sampling the output and feeding that sample back to the input on the next time step.  Since the audio I am using is sampled at 22050hz this method is not practical.  So what I decided to do is first use an auto encoder with a gumbel softmax in-between.   This way I could compress the audio data and learn a discrete encoding for it.  Once I have this encoder I plan to train an RNN on the encoding just like you would on text, then I can use the decoder to convert this into sound.  Currently the best architecture I have is as follows...

The encoder compresses the audio down 256x to a discrete representation with 4096 different values.  
Hard gumbel softmax between encoder and expander.  
The expander  expands the discrete representation back out to the length of the original raw audio.  
The decoder uses an RNN to predict the next sample based on the prior sample and input from the expander. (I tried a wavenet instead of RNN and so far the RNN produces a better result, I care more about quality than speed.)

sound\_loss = tf.reduce\_mean(tf.keras.losses.sparse\_categorical\_crossentropy(r, g, from\_logits = True))  
total\_loss = sound\_loss + enc\_loss  


So I would like to ask a few things...

1) Do you think the way I am using the gumbel softmax makes sense?

2) Since I am using the ""hard"" version of the gumbel softmax with the stop\_graidents do I still need to use the temperature parameter and anneal it?

3) Does my loss function make sense?  I added the enc\_loss term to the output of the encoder which adds a penalty for it deviating from a flat distribution.  I figure this is like the second term in the ELBO loss function used in a VAE.  I found it helps the model to learn to use more of the encoding.

4) Should I be using the gumbel softmax at all?  Maybe it makes more sense to just use a normal softmax and always take the argmax.  I figure the randomness adds helps it explore the possible encodings.

5) Any other thoughts?"

I guess my question is, can I hope to find some signal in this small amount of data for this text classification text, or is this baseline implementation trying to tell me that the data is very noisy and thus the experiment will be hard to get significant results from?

\- the data-driven approaches (e.g., machine learning, deep learning-based)

\- the classical approaches (using classic computer vision)

However, I have never implemented an object detector and I would really like to know more about the history of it and the main tools I can use to achieve this.

bendee983,MachineLearning,1618849898.0,[D] The challenges of applied machine learning,"From setting up the data infrastructure (breaking down the silos, creating data lakes, etc.) to collecting and cleaning training data, to setting up a scalable networking and compute clusters, dealing with business objectives and ethical issues, applying machine learning to real-world applications poses challenges that are absent in academic and research settings. 

Four key challenges in applied machine learning include the following:

* Defining the problem: Are you solving the right problem? Does it align with your business objectives? What is the desired accuracy from the model? Are you addressing a special problem or has anyone else solved it before? Can it be solved with a pre-trained model or do you need to develop your own models?
* Collecting training data: Are public datasets (ImageNet, MSCOCO, etc.) enough to train your models (most probably not)? Can you buy the data, do you already have it, or do you have to collect it? If you already have the data, is it in a consolidated store or is it siloed? Do you need to clean and label the data?
* Maintaining models: How much will your model be affected by decay? How frequently do you need to retrain your models? Do you have a pipeline for continuously collecting and maintaining your data in the future?
* Gathering the right team: Do you have the talent in-house? Do you have subject matter experts who can weigh in on the model's performance? Do you have a product manager who can define and assess business objectives for your machine learning strategy? Do you have a process to get input and feedback from the end-users of your system? Do you have software engineers who can integrate your models into existing products and IT staff who can provide reliable and scalable infrastructure for training and inference?

These are some of the challenges discussed in my latest article on the challenges of applied machine learning:

👉 What?

A simple yet effective method for directly detecting 3D objects from the 3D point cloud without the handcraft and heuristic point grouping mechanism.

❓Why?

The mainstream point-based object detectors based on the heuristic point grouping step, but the complexity and diversity of objects in the real scene may lead to wrong point assignments and degrade the 3D object detection performance, shown in Fig. 1

&#x200B;

[Fig 1.  With the heuristic point grouping step, all points in the blue box of RoI-Pooling or blue ball of Voting are assigned and aggregated to derive the object features, resulting in wrong assignments. Our group-free based approach automatically learns the contribution of all points to each object, which has the ability to alleviate the drawbacks of the hand-crafted grouping. ](https://preview.redd.it/m6rbt1f6l2s61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=37c77b021b7a7f14d44c52210ad4e2fc3607a7b1)

&#x200B;

🥊 The main ideas

1. Using the transformer decoder to model the relationship between the points and objects. All the points are used to form the feature of objects and the weighting of each point is automatically learned during training.
2. A multi-stage iterative box prediction framework is adopted, and the spatial encoding is refined iteratively in each stage.
3. A free-lunch multi-stage ensemble mechanism is used for improving the performance.

⚙️ Overall Architecture

PointNet is used as the backbone, the detection head is the multi-stage transformer decoder, shown in Fig. 2.

&#x200B;

[Fig 2.  This figure illustrates the simple architecture of our approach, including three major components: a backbone network to extract feature representations for each point in the point cloud, a sampling method to generate initial object candidates, and stacked attention modules to extract and refine object representations from all points. ](https://preview.redd.it/85qadvidl2s61.png?width=1107&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a4a31b10ccc824304d233df236b2d75fbdc94c)

**What is it?** Create an API for your models in seconds.

  •  Create engaging demos to show users what your models can do in real conditions.

**Why is it interesting ?**

* You can drag-and-drop to deploy all your models, it's that simple ! Afterwards you can call them from your jupyter notebook or any IDE. The whole process from registration to deployment won't take you more than 2 minutes.
* You know what you pay for, no hidden fees. We charge a little bit more than the price of the RAM. We want to have a 256MB RAM box for 1$ per month.

I am an Infrastructure Engineer. I built this because I wanted everyone to be able to make the most out of their models. What I usually see is models sleeping on the shelf somewhere, forever waiting to be deployed by someone else, so this is their time to shine.  


Lastly why use [inferrd.com](https://inferrd.com) when you can use AWS/GCP? I think AWS/GCP/Azure become too expensive once you're captive. So I wanted to build a tool that allows you to migrate easily and won't make you dependant of it.

Our output neuron z hence will have the equation z = w^(1)x^(1) \+ w^(2)x^(2) \+ b.

Let's say we set our bias unit to 0, and w^(1) to 1 and w^(2) to -1.In this way we will have output 0 for input combinations (0, 0) and (1, 1) - which is required.

And we will have output 1 when input is (1, 0) and the only exceptional case would be that of output being -1 when input is (0, -1). But we can mitigate this by using and additional condition that the result is 0 only when the output is 0 and it is 1 when the output is any other value than 0.

keepthepace,MachineLearning,1619525246.0,[P] I am writing a copyleft license for machine learning models. I'd love some comments and criticism,"Hello,

I am a software developer in robotics with a lot of love for open source. Recent events have made me ponder how one could release a trained model in order to keep it really open/free and I think (but would love to be proved otherwise) that there are no licenses applicable right now, as trained weights are a very different beast from source code or executable binaries. So I tried to write one by modifying the Affero GPL license (something the FSF explicitly allows in their FAQ): [I posted it here](https://github.com/yquemener/MLMPL) 

This is actually an old subject. I saw a discussion on the [debian-legal mailing list from 2009](https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2009/05/msg00028.html) about it. It also [crops up](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2018/07/msg00175.html) occasionally on [debian-devel](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2019/05/msg00380.html), was discussed at the [2012 Debconf](https://saimei.ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/debian-meetings/2012/debconf12/high/888_Machine_learning_threats_and_opportunities_for_Debian_and_Free_Software.ogv) and was also discussed by the [ffmpeg team](https://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2018-July/231834.html).

Having read that and many other cases and opinions, I think it is necessary to have a new license to ""open source"" trained weights but it is not necessarily a difficult task. I think (thanks to the previous free software efforts) it is already 95% done, we just need to adapt an existing license but be a bit more explicit about what a model is and not try to shoehorn a license designed for compiled software into the machine learning world.

I am not formally trained in copyright law, so I'd really appreciate someone with such a background to poke holes at my proposition, but everybody's constructive criticism is welcomed!"

I recently ~~published~~ released a review on transformers in vision, focused on the last months of research. I remember a few discussions around Vision Transformers in particular, but I would like to highlight a fact: while they're often seen as an intellectual curiosity that only Google can train, recent derivative models enjoy significant efficiency, outperforming all but EfficientNetV2 (if you allow for DeiT-like hard-label distillation) or all but EfficientNetV2 and Normalizer Free Networks (if you do not allow for hard-label distillation) on ImageNet.

Transformers-based models are also advantaged in large data regimes (e.g. ImageNet-21k or Google's internal JFT-300M datasets) due to their reduced inductive bias.

bjourne-ml,MachineLearning,1616320233.0,[D] Thoughts on unlikelihood training/antitraining?,"What is the sub's thoughts on unlikelihood training/antitraining?

The idea is dirt-simple; if the model does what you want you
reward it (likelihood) and if it doesn't you slap it
(unlikelihood). Say you have a language model that predicts the next
word. Such models tend to, should we say, ""cheat"" when confused by
guessing on words it has already seen.

For example, suppose the sentence is:

    in particular standard likelihood training and decoding

The model is given all words except for the last and is asked to
predict the next word. Likely, it will assign a high probability to
some or all of the preceding words (a well-known problem), leading to
continuations like:

    in particular standard likelihood training and in
    in particular standard likelihood training and particular
    in particular standard likelihood training and standard
    in particular standard likelihood training and training
    ...

This leads to repetitive text. Unlikelihood training/antitraining
attempts to solve this by penalizing the model for assigning
probability mass to preceding incorrect words. Suppose part of the
probability distribution produced by the model looks like:

    p(in|in particular standard likelihood training and) = 0.2
    p(particular|in particular standard likelihood training and) = 0.02
    p(standard|in particular standard likelihood training and) = 0.05
    p(standard|in particular standard likelihood training and) = 0.02

Then we'd calculate the unlikelihood (penalty) as

    -alpha*(log(1-0.2) + log(1-0.02) + log(1-0.05)+(1-0.02)),

where alpha is a weighting hyper-parameter. Backprop and the next time
the model makes the same prediction, it will assign less probability
mass to the preceding words.

Increasing diversity/reducing repetition is just one use case for
unlikelihood. Suppose you have the sentence

    recent large-scale language models ...

The target word is ""are"" but if the model predicts ""is"" you penalize
it because ""is"" is grammatically incorrect! Same for ""Perplexity and
accuracy ..."" - reward the model for ""were"" but penalize it for ""was"".

Here are papers that explain the concept much better than I can. The authors claim to have achieved
some very impressive results:

Present-Percentage88,MachineLearning,1619541186.0,[R] Online study: predicting COVID-19 misinformation in Twitter data using AI,"Hi everyone,

I am conducting a user study for my master's thesis regarding explainable AI (XAI) solutions that can predict COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter. Misinformation has been an important topic during the pandemic. Explainable AI solutions can help us detect misinformation and simultaneously explain their prediction which is key to understanding how they work.

Your participation will be beneficial towards the battle against misinformation and the pursuit towards transparent and responsible AI. During the online study, you will label COVID-19 related tweets and answer a set of questionnaires.

Requirements for participation:

* At least 18 years old
* Run the study on a laptop/desktop computer

You can participate autonomously using the following link:

**MESINESP2 Awards by BSC-Plan TL \[2,700€\]**

**Test sets and additional data are now available**

There is a pressing need for advanced multilingual semantic search strategies for health related content like literature, patents and clinical trials (cross-genre). The use of semantic search techniques in combination with structured vocabularies is critical for sophisticated searches or content analysis as needed by healthcare professionals, researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, patient groups and private citizens.

Following the impact of past BioASQ tracks for benchmarking studies (e.g. BioBERT) and organization of other initiatives like BioCreative or IberLEF, we propose three semantic labelling subtracks using the widely used DeCS vocabulary (similar to MeSH terms):

**MESINESP-L – Scientific Literature**: for automatic labelling of medical literature abstracts in Spanish (including recent COVID-19 literature).

**MESINESP-T – Clinical trials**: for automatic labelling of clinical trials summaries.

**MESINESP-P – Patents:** for automatic labelling of health-related patents in Spanish to improve patent intelligence.

**Data**: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4707104](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4707104)

MESINESP2 is organized in close collaboration with widely used multilingual medical literature databases (BIREME/WHO, ISCIII/Spain), which expressed a direct need for advanced technologies to accelerate manual indexing efforts for the contents in Spanish (spoken globally by over 572 million people). They do face a challenge to keep up with the increasing number of published medical papers when using purely manual indexing.

A large manually indexed collection of training documents will be provided. These documents have already been automatically annotated (> 1.5 million entity mentions) with  medical entities such as diseases, medical procedures, drugs and symptoms to facilitate the use of complementary strategies like *multi-label classification*, *multilingual transformers*, *graph matching*, *text similarity,* *advanced term matching* or *named entity recognition components*. 

Participating systems will be directly useful for ongoing medical literature indexing efforts, and thus improve competitive intelligence/prior art searches, enable complex search queries needed for evidence-based medicine, clinical decision making, or elaboration of clinical practice guidelines and serve as base for future tasks on semantic indexing of medical records or content in other languages. 

**Important dates**

* April 19: Updated Train, Validation and Test sets release
* April 19: Additional datasets release (Medical entities present in documents)
* April , 30: BioASQ9 Lab u/CLEF 2021 Registration Deadline
* May, 7: Start of the evaluation period

* July, 2: Camera ready paper submission.
* Sep 21-24: CLEF 2021 Conference

**Publications and BioASQ/CLEF2021 workshop**

Teams participating in MESINESP2 will be invited to contribute a systems description paper for the BioASQ (CLEF 2021) Working Notes proceedings, and a short presentation of their approach at the BioASQ 2021 workshop.

I trained a yolov3 model a while back and it is pretty accurate but gives a very low FPS of 0.223 on nano. I tried converting the model to tflite but that gives an even lower fps of 0.07. Please tell me how I can achieve real-time inference without any loss in accuracy?? Thanks in advance.

A great idea to improve StyleGAN inversion for complex real images that builds on top of the recent e4e and pSp papers.

The authors propose a fast iterative method of image inversion into the latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN generator that acheives SOTA quality at a lower inference time. The core idea is to start from the average latent vector in W+ and predict an offset that would make the generated image look more like the target, then repeat this step with the new image and latent vector as the starting point. With the proposed approach a good inversion can be obtained in about 10 steps. More details [here](https://t.me/casual_gan/24)

[The inversions are awesome!](https://preview.redd.it/sa63gu0dc6s61.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=56a647abbb5b1bb0a44f6c75e5fd78bb81ec5858)

fripperML,MachineLearning,1617172367.0,"[D] What’s the simplest, most lightweight but complete and 100% open source MLOps toolkit? -> MY OWN CONCLUSIONS","Although I have posted this summary in the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mfca0p/d_whats_the_simplest_most_lightweight_but/), most people won't find it, so to make it more visible I post it as another thread.

First of all, I have to thank the reddit ML community in general and each of you in particular for the detailed, insightful and interesting answers I have received in the past few days. I have learnt a lot and the picture in my head is now clearer. Now, I am posting a summary with the things that, for me, make more sense (it's my opinion and will serve as our guideline for making the decision, so it's not just a bare summary).

**General advice**

We should start with a reduced set of tools, the most useful ones, in order to have the flexibility to change or adapt our projects to a new infrastructure a provider could offer us. This is something that could happen.

**End-to-end solutions**

There are mainly two solutions that are 100% open source and free to install and use, and that may solve most of the requirements of ML practitioners: [Hopsworks](https://hopsworks.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [ClearML](https://allegro.ai/clearml/docs/). Among this two, if I had to chose one right now, it will be ClearML. Hopsworks might be much more complete, but ClearML seems to have a bigger community behind it and to be easier to install and use. So ClearML will be something to take a look at in case we go for an all-in-one package. I also like the idea of having a platform with an UI with all our projects.

**Python Programming**

[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) (including flake8-docstrings), [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are hugely recommended. [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) is something to take a look at too.

This morning I have found this [guide](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/) that might be worth it, as it covers many good practices. Also this [article](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/14).

Regarding the IDE, VSCode is not the same as Visual Studio, the most recommended one is VSCode.

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is also something to consider. But also one should be careful with it: its current development state is not very promising and maybe pip is more secure, as it is the official way.

**CI and Deployment**

Jenkins is a good tool, although maybe not the easiest one (Gitlab, Drone, and Circle are all easier to use). Docker might not be totally needed, but is hugely recommended as it is becoming a standard, and even many of the libraries rely on it (for example, ClearML does). In addition, it works very well with Jenkins.

We should switch from SVN to git (strongly recommended). [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a good option.

**Project Scaffolding**

[CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) or [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are the winners. I still think we will stick to Kedro template, because it offers extra functionality, and I like to think of each project as a set of pipelines to be run. Anyway, some cookiecutter templates are very good, like this [one](https://github.com/TezRomacH/python-package-template). In case we use both Kedro and ClearML, we'll have to figure out how to integrate its pipelines with ClearML tasks. But in the slack channel of ClearML there are other teams doing the same, so at least it's possible.

**Documentation**

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) for the documentation is totally recommended (Google style docstrings). [Napoleon](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html) can be very useful for helping with that. This covers documentation of the actual code. For documenting the business objective and other project related stuff, we could use jupyter notebooks in order to have everything inside the repo.

**Project registry**

ClearML if we finally chose it. Otherwise, we migth use an internal wiki or just the repository with a clear documentation.

**Data Exploration and Preparation**

We should use PySpark when things go ""big"", and Pandas when things fit in memory.

**Tests**

I expected Great Expectations library to be recommended, but nobody told anything. Instead, unit testing and/or smoke tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). And checking them with Jenkins. Anyway, if Kedro ends up being our project template, I'll keep an eye on the [plugin](https://github.com/tamsanh/kedro-great) with [Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations).

**Feature Store, Data Versioning**

Maybe not so important in the beginning. [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc) looks good, but it's not easy to use.

**Workflow engine or orchestrator**

In our case, we have one, but otherwise it is an important piece. Prefect is maybe the option I like the most for its simplicity, but Luigi is also a tool that I like.

Kedro, also related with this, because it is a tool for defining pipelines, does not care about how to run the pipelines and you can deploy them in several engines like Luigi, Prefect, Airflow or Kubeflow.

**Model registry**

Its importance depends on several considerations:

* If you have too many models in production.
* If models are frecuently retrained.
* If lots of models are trained and or tested in parallel.
* If some models make real-time predictions, and their performance is critical.

If any of the previous point happens to be true, a model registry can be a very important piece of the MLOps solution. Otherwise, you can consider it not essential.

**Experimenting**

It's an important piece. If we use ClearML, this will be solved. Otherwise, we might try [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) using Kedro-MLFlow or [PipelineX](https://pipelinex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) can be an interesting addition to define configurations, although Kedro does have a nice way too.

**Training**

Apart from the ""classical"" libraries, in case of DL for simplicity [PyTorch Lighting](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) will be our first option. Anyway, hardware limitations could be an issue (when models don't fit into memory, when training must be distributed... so that problems should be at least foreseen... both TensorFlow and PyTorch have ways of dealing with it).

**Model serving**

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Or even simpler: [DL4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/), to be used in Java when we need to communicate with the rest of the applications in real time.

Other interesting solutions are [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) and [Cortex](https://www.cortex.dev/), we should take a look at it too.

When high availability is important, we should take into account having redundant nodes and a resilient infraestructure (Kubernetes could be a solution).

**Visualization**

We should take a look at [voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html) and [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

**Model monitoring**

We could use Jenkins pipelines or ad-hoc scheduled processed. We don't need a tool for that."

skwaaaaat,MachineLearning,1617210746.0,[Discussion] Methods for interpreting the meta knowledge learned by meta-learning methods?,"Hi, I've been trying to draw some insights from the meta-learned model, e.g., the task relationship, summarization of the shared task structure, etc.

To be more specific, for example, when learning from certain chemistry datasets, a good meta-learning method should implicitly learn about the shared chemistry principles. And my question is, how could we visualize/interpret such learned meta knowledge? 

I couldn't find any relevant literature on this topic. Could someone point me in the right direction? Thanks a lot!"
Seankala,MachineLearning,1619520030.0,[D] Is there any work highlighting the effectiveness of using bilinear transformations for certain tasks?,"I recently read a paper in computer vision titled [_Learning Deep Bilinear Transformation for Fine-grained Image Representation (Zheng et al., 2019)_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03621) about a particular type of bilinear transformation (coined the ""group bilinear"") and they claim that bilinear transformations work well for fine-grained image recognition. Some works in natural language processing (in particular relation extraction) also claim that bilinear classifier layers work well.

I'm curious if there's any work out there that details _why_ this may be the case? Most of the material I read claim that the transformation ""learn semantic grouping"" or ""learn pairwise factorization,"" but it usually ends at about that.

Any recommendations or opinions are appreciated. Thanks."
ydennisy,MachineLearning,1620044509.0,[D] Many Logistic Regression heads.,"I am interested in building / finding a NN architecture which would consist of a network, which can be viewed as an embedding layer, with many LogReg heads on top each one predicting a certain class. The purpose is to learn a dense representation of features, which would be good at predicting the various classes, hence the loss from the LR heads needs to be propagated down into the network.

The interest I have here is would this architecture work well for new unseen classes from a similar domain / problem space.

Has anyone come across such a model architecture implementation?"
mLalush,MachineLearning,1618474344.0,[D] Why have the standard data formats in object detection remained as COCO/PASCAL VOC/YOLO as opposed to switching over to a nested columnar format?,"In image classification, early standards generally had users divide image files into different training and validation folders, as well as (sometimes) requiring separate folders for each class label. While researchers seem to have held on to these standards, the APIs of deep learning libraries eventually evolved to allow more flexible usage which didn't necessarily require users to shuffle around image files in folders should they want to adjust their training and validation setups.

Keeping training and validation files in different folders probably has certain benefits for the reproducibility of research, namely in making it *abundantly* clear how the train/val split was performed. However, this convention -- when enforced -- does introduce something of a ""barrier"" for beginners just looking to train a model on their existing labeled data with minimal data wrangling.

Thus, existing library APIs for image classification seem to have converged to loading references to filepaths, either as a list or in a tabular/columnar format, while encouraging users to perform their own train/val splits on these references to the data. This allows for maximum flexibility, as users can have their data organized however they wish, and easily perform whatever augmentations they wish to perform on the splits.

Most approachable tutorials for adapting a model to custom datasets now follow the standard of having users define their own dataloaders. This new standard, however, does not seem to have proliferated to *user facing* object detection and semantic/instance segmentation libraries.

Here, some of you might interject and point out that

1. The data is hierarchical in nature. Several bounding boxes, polygon coordinates or RLEs may exist for each image. COCO/PASCAL VOC/YOLO are the natural way to store such data.
2. Storing hierarchical data in a (nested) columnar format will introduce memory overhead.
3. Data formats such as .csv, .tsv don't work well with nested data.

None of these, in my opinion, are convincing arguments for why so many object detection libraries need to break with the conventions that have evolved for image classification. Hierarchical data can easily be stored as lists nested in cells of a dataframe. We don't necessarily have to repeat a row for however many objects exist in a given image.  The arrow ([https://arrow.apache.org/install/](https://arrow.apache.org/install/)) library exists for storing and loading nested columnar data.

Am I insane in thinking that object detection library APIs will eventually -- but inevitably -- converge to the standard of image classification APIs? Why haven't they already? Are the established standards too entrenched? Torchvision already seems to be heading there: [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision\_tutorial.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html). I can't say the same for most other libraries, where the standard remains ""Please organize your data after these very specific instructions and execute this script with 20 poorly documented (optional) args""."

yusuf-bengio,MachineLearning,1617269822.0,[D] Keras: Killed by Google,"First of all, this is not a rant about Tensorflow (it actually is but more on that later). Disclaimer: I have been working on research projects with Teano, JAX, PT, TF 1 &2, and of course the original Keras.

The **original Keras** was just a high-level API specification for machine learning, which was really nice when collaborating with people who have less engineering background. The API was framework agnostic and the main implementation supported multiple backends (Teano, Tensorflow, and MS-CNTK)

Essentially, the API design resembled the abstractions of modern high-level frameworks such as PyTorch-Lightning and fast.ai, with slightly different *design* *flavors* (e.g., a Keras model combines the network with the metrics and training code in a single object, whereas other frameworks usually separate the network from the learner object).

The huge advantage of keras was that it was available and the API stable **back in 2016, 2017.** I think this is something remarkable in a field that moves so fast.

But then, you know the story, Google announced its plans to incorporated it into Tensorflow 2. This wouldn't have been a problem on its own, but it slowly killed keras for 3 reasons:

1. During the time-span of this merge, the keras API was effectively ""frozen"", making it lag behind alternatives in terms of features
2. The release of TF2 came too late. On top of that, the first versions were buggy and even now are lacking some basic features.
3. Instead of making a hard cut between TF 1 and 2, Google decided that it's better to carried over a lot of baggage and crap from TF1, making the framework extremely bloated. When something does not work, you get overwhelmed by long cryptic error messages and stacktraces longer than your screen can visualize.

So, this post is really intended as a **funeral for the keras API**.

Looking forward to know your thoughts.

EDIT: I have nothing personal against Google. Far from it, I really like their impressive contributions to ML (Colab, TPU, JAX, ...), but the story with keras and TF2 is really frustrating for me who liked working with it in the past."

King-Little,MachineLearning,1619775635.0,[D] M1 MacBooks versus Google Colab for deep learning,"I am just starting getting into deep learning with `tf.keras`. I am at the point where I have to decide where I want to develop. The thesis project will be timeseries prediction. My options are PyCharm on Macbook Air M1 2020 or a 2013 4th Gen Intel i5 Linux desktop and Google Colab (please let me know if there are others).

So the question I have now is which one is faster/better suited for my puropses. M1 got [hyped](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/ml-compute-training-on-mac) a lot so I thought the M1 would savage my desktop (and acutally the hype biased my purchase decision), but well its only slightly better (like 1.2-1.5x faster in my cifar10 benchmark) and I wonder if its worth the effective 1-2 GB of RAM left on MacOS vs the \~14 GB on my Linux machine. Further there is Colab and I can't really tell which one will win the race, since Colab limits resources by demand but also allows distributed fit on cloud TPUs, which would introduce some extra coding efforts. Then again I have to say: so does ML on Apple Silicon, which comes with [a handful of limitations](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos#additional-information), a [peculiar MiniConda setup](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues/153), a [lot of issues](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues) (also severe ones, like training errors etc., problems which I would not even recognize) which are actually not really being worked on.

austingwalters,MachineLearning,1619503940.0,[P] Data Profiler | What's in your data?,"Hello /r/MachineLearning

I thought the community might be interested in a project I have been apart of.

Our team has been working on a python library called the [DataProfiler](https://github.com/capitalone/DataProfiler). 

The project had two objectives:

1. Quickly and accurate (cheaply) identify sensitive data (PII/NPI) in datasets.
2. Generate data profiles which can be utilized in downstream (ML) applications

Regarding sensitive data detection, we published a workshop paper on the model within the library: [Sensitive Data Detection with High-Throughput Neural Network Models for Financial Institutions](https://aaai-kdf.github.io/kdf2021/assets/pdfs/KDF_21_paper_10.pdf)

In addition to sensitive data detection, the library also calculates statistical features and general characteristics of a dataset. This has helped our team quickly evaluate datasets, but also enabled the profiles use in downstream applications.

Some nifty features the community may be interested in:  


* [Can load most files into a DataFrame with a single command](https://capitalone.github.io/DataProfiler/docs/0.4.4/html/data_readers.html) (identifies headers, formats, etc)
* [Extending the current entity detection model with transfer learning](https://capitalone.github.io/DataProfiler/docs/0.4.4/html/data_labeling.html#extending-a-data-labeler-with-transfer-learning) is easy and takes only a few lines of code (or retrain from scratch).
* The model works on both structured (CSV, TSV, JSON, etc) and unstructured data (text)
* It's possible (though a tad rough) to [add a new custom model for entity detection](https://capitalone.github.io/DataProfiler/docs/0.4.4/html/add_new_model_to_data_labeler.html)
* [Profiles can be saved, loaded and merged](https://capitalone.github.io/DataProfiler/docs/0.4.4/html/profiler.html)

Generally, we are looking for feedback and curious what the community thinks of the project?"

chasep255,MachineLearning,1617278214.0,[D] Using activity regularization instead of batch norm.,"Is there any reason I can't accomplish the same goal of batch normalization using an activity regularizer? Basically I would add a penalty to the loss function for a layer who's activation does not have an mean of zero and variance of one. There are two reasons I might prefer this method...

I am trying to train GANs and when using batch norm it behaves differently at inference then during training. This causes the discriminator to be able to have something like 90% accuracy while the generator also thinks it has 90% accuracy. I can solve this by using a really fast momentum of 0.5 but does not seem like the best solution. Ideally I want something that behaves the same during training as inference.

Secondly, I only have 8GB of vram on my RTX 3070 (really wish I went for the 3090 now). This poses a tight constraint on my batch size depending on the size of the model. As I understand batch norm works best with large batches of at least size 32. I usually am training with smaller batches.

I can't really think of a reason not to try this. Any thoughts? Also I am unsure what would be the best term to add to the loss function. I was thinking something like the following but there may be a better way.

`def normal_reg(x):`  
`return tf.square(tf.reduce_mean(x)) + tf.square(tf.math.reduce_variance(x) - 1)`"

(VADER tool was constructed and scores were given in these ranges based on an evaluation of 9,000 token features by 10 independent humans. )

...Although, I couldn’t say the word translation would have the same effective score as its English version. So maybe the preventive hiccup method would be to translate first ....

He mentions that the methods proposed enabled ""fast weight changes through additive outer products of self-invented activation patterns"" which are similar to today's self-attention mechanism used in Transformers. Recently there has been several variants of Transformers that uses linear approximation for efficiency purposes, and such works demonstrate similar performance as the version with softmax, which he claims to be similar to fast-weights.

Apart from this blog post, Schmidhuber's lab also published an article recently on this topic, “Linear Transformers Are Secretly Fast Weight Memory Systems” (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11174).

ProbablyCloseEnough,MachineLearning,1620535166.0,[R] Slurm Interface Investigation Report,"This is a followup on my previous threads [\[R\] Slurm interface survey (2 minutes)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/lfn7d9/r_slurm_interface_survey_2_minutes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [\[R\] Slurm Interface Prototype Evaluation Survey (2 minutes)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mf847y/r_slurm_interface_prototype_evaluation_survey_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Your responses to these surveys helped me complete coursework in the human-computer interaction course I was taking. Thank you.

The first survey was an instance of **needfinding**, which is where I investigate the users of an interface with an aim to find their demographics, the things they are trying to do with the interface, the context of these tasks, and their impressions of the interface(s) they use to do a certain **target task**, which in this case is scheduling a computing job on shared computing resources using Slurm. The following is copied from my paper.

>There are a few takeaways that I can get from the survey results. Most respondents use a command line interface, presumably the one that Slurm provides, and they are not satisfied and not unsatisfied with it. Most respondents use Slurm fewer than 10 times per week, which is expected because we expect computing jobs to have high enough complexity to be worth scheduling with Slurm. Other insights might be compromised by bias, as explained below.  
>  
>I had intended to take certain steps to control for biases, but I had not anticipated the limited time and responses that I would have to gather responses. Therefore, some of the mechanisms that I had intended to use to reduce bias are not implemented. One such mechanism was providing the survey in Mandarin in addition to English. I only provided it in English because I did not have time to verify a Mandarin translation. Thus, English-literate users are overrepresented. Another mechanism was distributing the survey in different communities. Because I was limited to 25 responses, I had to stop gathering responses before I could send it to communities other than students taking CS 6750 at Georgia Tech and [r/machinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning) on Reddit, which is frequented by machine learning researchers. Thus, academic users and researchers are overrepresented. I was able to implement mechanisms that were inherent to the survey design, such as not showing questions before participants start the survey and asking questions so that they do not encourage certain responses over others.

I executed one other needfinding activity, in which I observed 3 participants doing the target task, giving them the option to explain their actions. I also performed a heuristic evaluation of the Slurm interface for doing the target task. Based on these activities, I defined performance goals for proposed prototype interfaces.

>A new interface should maintain functionality for the most common tasks that the users do, which includes the target task, as well as determining available partitions, charge IDs, and hardware configurations that are available on the computing clusters. Criteria for evaluation is whether a user can perform those tasks. At the same time, it should be at least as accurate and efficient compared to the command line interface. Evaluation criteria are time and keystrokes or clicks. It should require the same or less time or the same or fewer keystrokes or clicks to perform the same tasks and doing them predictably and reliably.  
>  
>At the same time, it should be more learnable such that a new user should be able to learn to use it from within the interface, and perform at least the target task without script errors caused by forgetting key words or syntax. The criterion for evaluation is whether a new user can do so.  
>  
>In terms of accessibility, if appropriate files are in place, performing at least the target task must require only mouse clicks or finger taps, with a keyboard required only for first-time authentication. The criterion for evaluation is whether a user can do so.  
>  
>The interface must be compatible with client devices running Linux, and preferably also Windows and macOS. The interface must be compatible with Slurm servers running Linux and comply with their terms of use. The criterion for evaluation is whether it can be installed and used on Linux, connecting to a Slurm server running Linux.  
>  
>The development of the interface must cost no more than 20 hours of development time for a single researcher who has limited experience in graphical user interface development.

At the time, I was not sure whether I had to implement the interface. Upon learning that I did not, I decreased the importance of cost.

I then proceeded to brainstorm 20 prototype interfaces. I used my gut feeling to evaluate the anticipated performance of each idea in terms of functionality, accuracy, efficiency, learnability, accessibility, compatibility, compliance, and cost. Weights were 1, 1, 0.8, 1, 0.8, 1, 1, -0.2 respectively. (The weight of cost is negative because lower is better.) I found the top three ideas were

1. A simple executable with a form
2. A DAG for organizing jobs
3. A run configuration available in an IDE

The third one was presented in my second survey. [This figure](https://imgur.com/0m9onoh) was presented with the following text.

>Consider an interface that is an extension that can be installed on an integrated development environment (IDE), that enables scheduling jobs in the same way that a user would run them locally through a run configuration. The configuration settings panel (shown in the figure above) enables changing common settings and enforces a valid configuration. Upon clicking the Run button, the interface attempts to schedule the job.

[This figure](https://imgur.com/7AH5zCX) summarizes the responses I got from the survey. Because respondents need not perceive the intervals between response options to be constant, I can't do any statistical tests, but I can still eyeball the results to inform a subsequent round of needfinding.

>The main takeaways are that the prototype might not meet efficiency requirements. As expected, the greatest advantages the proposed interface has over the command line interface (which I determined users typically use) seem to be that it is more accurate, more learnable, more memorable, and that it fits better into users' workflows. I was surprised that many respondents expected to perform the target task somewhat slower. None expected to do it much more quickly, and 2 expected to do it much more slowly. An interpretation would be that many respondents are so experienced at using the command line interface that it would be difficult to outperform them.  
>  
>Changes that are suggested from the feedback are that the next iteration of this prototype, if it will be subject to further development, should try to increase efficiency. However, the demographic may find that the sacrifice in efficiency is worth the advantages in other areas. I did not collect information about the relative importance of these aspects.

At this point, the course assignments changed such that I had to investigate a different interface. I've become very busy with work, and since I won't be paid by anyone for continuing this investigation, and because my grade is no longer being held hostage, I'm going to just leave this as is."

Ideally, minibatch training approximates IID sampling from an infinite dataset (the true distribution). What is the argument against IID sampling of the training data?

I recently saw someone who was scatterplotting batch losses during training. This is more informative than the standard ""loss per epoch"" plot. It could be combined with a moving average of the latest K batches, which is \~gaussian, so confidence intervals are easily added. And with IID sampling there won't be any leftover batches with odd sizes.

EDIT: The reason this came up for me is because I have a model trained on two datasets with different losses. I was struggling with how to define an epoch when it dawned on me, why even use epochs at all? Just sample the data for each batch. Works fine. And one less nested loop is good for your health :)"

SQL_beginner,MachineLearning,1617811685.0,[D] Feature Selection for Large Datasets,"To begin my question, I would like to quote a paper (by Ishawaran et al) on ""random forests for survival analysis data"", in which the authors (very concisely) outline the difficulties of feature selection (i.e. which variables to include in a statistical model) in classical regression models and how this problem is somewhat alleviated with more advanced models :

""Further, because these methods (i.e. classical regression models, e.g. cox ph regression - even though it's semi-parametric) are often parametric, nonlinear effects of variables must be modeled by transformations or expanding the design matrix to include specialized basis functions. Often ad hoc approaches, such as stepwise regression, are used to determine if nonlinear effects exist. Identifying interactions, especially those involving multiple variables, is also problematic. This must be done by brute force (examining all two-way and threeway interactions, e.g.), or must rely on subjective knowledge to narrow the search.

In contrast, these difficulties are handled automatically using forests. We illustrate the ease with which RSF can uncover complex data structures through an in-depth case study of the prognostic implications of being underweight, overweight, or obese and having severe, but stable coronary artery disease.

Investigators have noted complex patterns surrounding possible reverse causation in underweight individuals, interactions with smoking, and an unclear inflection point at which point increasing body mass confers increased risk Some have identified a possible obesity paradox among patients with established heart disease in which increased body mass predicts better survival. To clarify these issues, we analyzed a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass surgery. Using RSF, (random survival forest) we identified a complex relationship between long-term survival, body mass, renal (kidney) function, smoking, and number of internal coronary artery bypass grafts. We believe our novel findings help explain some of the apparent contradictions previously reported.""

Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.1645.pdf

Essentially, the authors claim that traditional regression models struggle with feature selection and the newer models (e.g. bagging, random forest) are able to better deal with feature selection. I do remember from an intro stats class, the somewhat tedious process of determining which variables to include in a multiple linear regression model. As the authors described, I remember there was something called ""CP Mallow's Criteria"" in which potential variables were repeatedly included and excluded in the regression model and the value of CP Mallow's Criteria was monitored - a final selection of variables for the model was decided on the basis of this criteria. However, this selection process becomes inefficient for large datasets (if I understand correctly, this means you would have to refit the model for many different combinations of variables, resulting in a ""combinatorics explosion"" for a large number of variables). Like the authors mention, you can also ""manually hard code"" interaction terms in the model (e.g. log(var1), var1var2, var1/(var2var3), var1/(var2+var3), etc.) - and there an infinite such number of potential interactions. Improper feature selection can also result in unwanted effects such as multicollinearity. The last point I would like to bring up - although my knowledge of mathematics is not strong enough to fully substantiate it - is that classical regression models are said to have a tendency to overfit (I don't know why - I have seen visual demonstrations of this, but I don't know if there is a mathematical explanation behind this, or if it's just an empirical observation) and poorly generalize to new data (again, I don't know why); and that classical regression models are only able to ""recognize linearly separable patterns in the data"" (intuitively I can understand this, e.g. draw a circle of red points and a smaller circle of blue points that fits in the red circle, a single line can not separate the two colors - but I don't know if there is a mathematical explanation behind this).

This brings me to my question about feature selection for large datasets. With the advent of technology, data is becoming bigger and bigger everyday - convolution neural networks are the ""go to method"" for analyzing pictures (a standard black and white picture is said to have 786 variables), whereas DNA is said to have even more. In such instances, it surely must be impossible to address feature selection as done in conventional statistical modelling. Please excuse my poor understanding of math - but my understanding is that newer statistical models have ""built in"" methods of handling the feature selection problem. For instance, random forest ""randomly"" chooses different combinations of variables and sees which combinations result in better model performance, the exact randomizing mechanism (uncorrelated trees) is said to also prevent against multicollinearity (I ahve heard that the creator of the random forest algorithm Leo Breiman claims through theoretical statistics that random forest by definition can not ""over fit"" and has some desirable error bounds and convergence properties - is this true?). Meanwhile, I have read on data science blogs (I'm not going to lie) that deep neural networks are able to ""automatically"" learn and consider ""useful"" combinations of features for approximating the target function (am I correct?).

All in all, what I want to ask here : for large datasets, where sometimes the features don't have any immediate meanings (e.g. a patient's blood pressure vs the information contained in the 231st pixel of a photograph) - is there any ""real"" way to handle feature selection? Or is this usually taken care of by the statistical model itself (e.g. random forest and neural networks)? I have seen examples online where people attempted to write a massive FOR LOOP in which they train the same model with thousands of variable combinations ... but I am not sure how feasible this is.

Can someone please provide a comment on this?

Thanks"

Increasingly we use machine learning to build interactive systems that learn from past actions and the reward obtained. Theory suggests several possible approaches, such as contextual bandits, reinforcement learning, the do-calculus, or plain old Bayesian decision theory. What are the most theoretically appropriate and practical approaches to doing causal inference for interactive systems?

We are particularly interested in case studies of applying machine learning methods to interactive systems that *did* or *did* *not* use Bayesian or *likelihood* based methods, with a discussion about why this choice was made in terms of practical or theoretical arguments. We also welcome submissions in the following areas:

* Offline evaluation of recommender and interactive systems.
* Comparison of Bayesian, off-policy and other heuristic approaches for offline metrics.
* Probabilistic approaches applied to contextual bandits and reinforcement learning approaches.
* Probabilistic approaches to incrementality and attribution.
* Non-Bayesian approaches and trade-offs with Bayesian/Likelihood approaches.
* Bayesian methods in a production environment.

gokuresearch,MachineLearning,1617167679.0,[D] Is it worth buying a GPU workstation as a graduate student?,"I'm graduate student pursuing masters with thesis. I'm also hoping to pursue PhD in the future. Right now, I've a laptop with GTX 1070 and it helped me a lot for learning various algorithms in ML/DL, which also indirectly helped me publish few research papers in well known conferences during my undergraduate.

But with the growing computation requirements for DL, I was wondering that is it worth investing in a proper workstation having 2x RTX 3080 or other similar high configs for a graduate student (who is already a part of the well funded research lab and have access to GPU clusters for lab's research work)??

I love to do personal experiments and exploring latest research whenever possible. And because of the current trend, it requires more and more computations to just explore most of the things. Apart from that, global chip shortage is also a concern as it's leading to increase in GPU prices overall.

Therefore, I would like to receive any kind of suggestions and thoughts.

Their paper was recently accepted as an oral presentation at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2021). In their paper, the researchers describe applying deep reinforcement learning to discrete optimization. Discrete optimization focuses on problems that deal with discrete “building blocks” that must be combined in a particular order or configuration to optimize the desired property. They focused on a type of discrete optimization called symbolic regression. Symbolic regression finds short mathematical expressions that fit data gathered from an experiment. It aims to discover the underlying equations or dynamics of a physical process.

user692646,MachineLearning,1620387919.0,[D] Element-wise multiplication instead of Convolution,"I'm considering using element-wise multiplication as the fundamental operation in a net, and I wanted to know if this has been done before in the literature.

The operation for a single layer would work as follows:

1. Given an M x N input image, multiply it element-wise by an M x N weight matrix.
2. Add an M x N matrix of biases to the output of step 1.
3. Compute a non-linearity (e.g. ReLU) element-wise on the output of step 2.
4. Use a K x K average pooling kernel with stride K to down-sample the output of step 3.

The reason I am considering using this operation instead of a conv layer is because I think the conv layer is a bit too regularized for my problem. By that, I mean if the convolution operation were treated as a matrix-vector multiplication, such that the input to the conv layer is an image re-shaped to be a column vector, then the matrix would be too sparse.

If needed, I could enforce sparsity later with L1 regularization, for example.

Has this sort of operation been considered before in the literature?"

We are starting to incorporate machine learning techniques to improve a lot of our processes. We've had good success and the goal of ""cushioning the blow of investment"" has been met.

So now we're looking to invest in scaling out this team (hiring maybe 3-5 additional people). The rub of the matter is: I'm not really sure how to attract the right talent for the job. We do not need cutting edge stuff. For most business problems, the value is immense if we can get something ""good enough"" out of the door. Pragmatic, but in between 'hacker' and 'enterprise.'

I come from a comp sci/programming background, moved into data, and now am basically using the tools without much in depth knowledge, but have the business domain knowledge to know where to successfully apply them. Ideally, I would love to hire ""problem solvers"" who care more about the business and generating value than how they accomplish it. I think these types of positions will start popping up a lot more as the barrier to entry decreases, but I'm having the damndest time on attracting the right people. It's not really a data science role, or a data engineering role, or a ML role. It's kind of a 'jack of all trades."" A data practitioner is what I call it, but I don't see any similar postings on indeed (if anyone knows of any I could cheat off of, that'd be great).

So now the questions:

1. Do you guys have any advice on what job title we should be posting?
2. What would you expect a salary range to be like for this type of position? Midlevel data folks vs mid level programming seems to pay less, but I don't want to drive away anyone.
3. What types of phrases can I use to make it clear that this isn't necessarily a ""data science"" role or a ""ml"" role. It's a problem solving role around data. I'd hate for anyone to be disappointed in the work."

1.   Point estimates based on MLE or MAP give you a (sort of) solution for P(w|D). 
2. P(w|D) written in bayesian form is intractable to compute. The alternative is to find a proxy for P(w|D) called as variational posterior q(w|θ) which minimizes L(θ, w) = KL(q(w|θ)||P(w|D))
3. Eq-(1) breaks it further into the known ELBO form.
4. Proposition 1. is introduced as the generalisation for the gaussian re-parameterisation trick. I can understand the intention behind it somewhat but didn't get the proof and result part. Where is the first term in the right-hand expression coming from?\[**HELP**\]
5.  L(θ, w) is estimated empirically through monte-carlo sampling. eq(2)
6. The gaussian variational posterior estimate part now applies the Proposition 1 to practice . However eq(3) and (4) stem from proposition 1. Hence, not clear to me. 
7. For the prior on w, P(w), authors suggest sampling from mixture of 2 gaussians. Also it appears that params for the priors remain constant in training. 
8. Lastly a weighting scheme for the contribution of each of the Loss params(Likelihood vs complexity). 

I have gone through couple of blog posts but proposition 1 is still unclear to me :/ Any help in appreciated. Sorry in advance if its very basic and/or common knowledge."

Abstract :

Radiologist examination of chest CT is an effective way for screening COVID-19 cases. In this work, we overcome three challenges in the automation of this process: (i) the limited number of supervised positive cases, (ii) the lack of region-based supervision, and (iii) the variability across acquisition sites. These challenges are met by incorporating a recent augmentation solution called SnapMix, by a new patch embedding technique, and by performing a test-time stability analysis. The three techniques are complementary and are all based on utilizing the heatmaps produced by the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) explainability method. Compared to the current state of the art, we obtain an increase of five percent in the F1 score on a site with a relatively high number of cases, and a gap twice as large for a site with much fewer training images.

[https://medium.com/riselab/ai-and-memory-wall-2cb4265cb0b8](https://medium.com/riselab/ai-and-memory-wall-2cb4265cb0b8)

TLDR:

\- The computational cost of training recent SOTA Transformer based models in NLP has been scaling at a rate of 750x/2yrs, and the model parameter count is scaling at 240x/2yrs.

\- In contrast, the GPU/TPU DRAM capacity has been only scaling at a rate of 2x/2yrs. In the meantime, the peak hardware FLOPS has been scaling at a rate of 3.1x/2yrs. 

\- To put these numbers into perspective, peak hardware FLOPS has increased by 90,000x, while DRAM/Interconnect bandwidth has only scaled by a factor of 30x over the past 20 years.

\- ""No exponential can continue forever"", and delaying an exponential with the rate of 240x/2yrs will not be feasible for long. We need to rethink the training, deployment, and design of AI models and hardware to deal with this increasingly challenging memory wall."

The agent is placed inside a multi-roomed house and must locate and carry objects to the specified destination within a specified number of steps. The agent is a two-armed robot. It can only carry two items simultaneously. But the environment also has containers that the agent can use to carry multiple items at once. The agent must find the right balance between exploration, carrying tasks, using containers, etc.

According to the researchers, pure end-to-end RL approaches perform poorly on the challenge. On the other hand, a hybrid approach where the RL agent is controlled by a rule-based high-level planner improves the performance (though the problem is still far from solved).

The challenge makes use of some simplifications in terms of computer vision and action/state complexity:

\- the agent uses magnetic hands and doesn't need to handle objects with fingers

\- the environment is viewed in first person, though the agent is provided with RGB, depth, and segmentation maps

\- movements and rotation are limited to specific increments (0.25m movements, 15-degree rotations)

The challenge is still open for submissions and will be presented at CVPR embedded AI workshop in June. It will be interesting to see what new innovations the challenge will usher.

SomeParanoidAndroid,MachineLearning,1617579186.0,[D] Practical tips for Active Learning (my approach does not outperform random sampling),"Hello fellow practitioners,

I have a dataset for classification where the labeling process is the output of a very computationally expensive physical simulation (that I have to run for every datapoint). So I proposed to incorporate the active learning framework to limit the amount of data needed.

I am implementing the approach(es) from Yarin Gal's et al. [Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02910). In that they use their *MC Dropout* Bayesian neural network and they take advantage of its ability to quantify uncertainties in the predictions.  This allows them to apply the acquisition functions on the pool/unlabelled data and include the `argmax` datapoint into the training set at every iteration.

My problem is that all those functions are no better than randomly choosing training instances every time in my dataset.

The parameter settings that correspond to the figure I am showing are the following (should be self explanatory I believe):

    # Specific parameters for the MC Dropout CNN 
    dropout_p                     = 0.3   # Higher values make the network less certain
    reg                           = 10e-5 # Higher values make the network less certain
    MC_samples                    = 30    # The higher the number, the more accurate the predictions will be
    
    # Parameters for the Active Learning iterations
    initial_dataset_size          = 0.05 # 5% of the training dataset (that is, 220 datapoints)
    training_set_increments       = 2    # How many new datapoints to add from the pool at every iteration
    training_epochs_per_iteration = 1    # For reference, training on the full dataset converges after about 35 epochs

I have been experimenting with different values but running a comparison takes about half a day, so I would be very grateful to anyone that has dealt with such a situation before and has any pratical tips so as to choose appropriate values. Guestimates from anyone are welcome as well.

Briefly, I found out that increasing the `initial_dataset_size` to 15% or `training_epochs_per_iteration` to 5 does not provide any advantage to random sampling. Meddling with the regularization value however does help, but the results I am showing are the best I can get so far.

Competitive-Rub-1958,MachineLearning,1620563385.0,[D] Are ViT's good enough for moderate/low data conditions?,"The OG `ViT` was pretty data heavy, and there were some improvements with Data efficient flavours.

But has there been any significant advances in places like CIFAR-100 without huge pre-training dataset? I would hardly classify IMAGENET21K as something that is used in the real-world.

I have about 200k images over 50 classes (Million Songs Dataset) for pre-training, and a 20K subset (MagNaTune) for fine-tuning. Should I use any of the latest Visual Transformers or standard CNN's?

Thanks for taking the time out to address my query!"
