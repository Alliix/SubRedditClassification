usergirl2468,unpopularopinion,1620531329.0,"Primarily, most people travel to show off.","I’m sure we’d all like to assume we are a part of the minority that travels and doesn’t meticulously document and share vacation photos and updates to the various group chats and social media platforms we are a part of (and yes, it still counts if you are only sharing with family). Most people don’t go to another country to immerse themselves in the language and observe the culture for the private expansion of our minds. We like to stay in the fancy hotels and buy the trinkets from the street vendors to prove we were there. We visit places we aren’t overly interested in but feel obligated to go because heaven forbid that nosy Jackie from sales will leave you feeling like an idiot if you travelled ALL the way to Iceland and DIDN’T see the blue lagoon. We hike mountains to take our summit pics and feel as if we are keeping up with the rest of the world who is in all likelihood travelling to the place we just left to do the exact same thing."
NickBoi45,unpopularopinion,1620568651.0,You DO stop being a parent,Since it’s Mother’s Day I thought it would be the perfect day to post this opinion but anyways people say “you never stop being a parent” which is simply not true. Why? Once all your kids move out you don’t have to raise them anymore and technically that means you are no longer a parent. Sure you may still be in touch with them but it’s not like you are actively feeding them.
PitchTime9211,unpopularopinion,1620551896.0,"Billie Ellish is a rаpper, not a singer.","She cannot sing to save her life and all her songs are literally her just talking slow. She is more of a rаper than singer. People have this idea that rаp means they must talk fast over the beat but talking slow is still rаp. The beats that she uses are more pop than rаp but doesn't change the fact that she isn't a singer. She is basically the female lil xan. She even started her career on soundcloud like most rappers these days, she is emo rаp imo."

Pink_Slime_Tenders,unpopularopinion,1620524418.0,"Obsession with ""aesthetics"" kills self-expression","I see so many TikTok/Instagram kids obsessed over their ""aesthetic"" and being ""alternative"" (Cottagecore, kidcore, indie, ""Key West Kitten"", etc) and it's *so embarrassing*. I don't mind if you're drawn to a particular style, but proclaiming to the world that you're a diehard ""alt"" and putting it in your bio *has to stop*.

Just look up ""grunge aesthetic"" and be astonished at the cascade of popular skater & eboy clothing, despite the actual subculture being anti-fashion. It's like when TikTok get a hold of something, it becomes commodified in a mainstream & marketable way to make it less about your own expression and more about fitting into a consumerist box. Also, creating a popular ""indie"" aesthetic literally defeats the purpose of being ""independent"" as the name implies.  

It's just another wave of ""not like other girls"" type people."
Temporary-Persimmon4,unpopularopinion,1620416517.0,It’s annoying when hairdressers and other service providers try to make conversation,"I get that they do it because they’ve been taught to as it’s considered good customer service etc. But I feel they should ask at the beginning if you would like a chat or would rather keep conversation brief. When I get my haircut I prefer to just relax and enjoy someone playing with my hair, I can’t enjoy it if I need to be talking. Equally for instance when I take a taxi I would much rather stare out the window and day dream rather than be chatting, especially if I’m tired."
irllylikebubbles,unpopularopinion,1620472624.0,I prefer online school.,"I had control over my own time, and I loved it. Studying was so much more relaxing with google meet calls.

I exercised daily and studied more Spanish than I’ve ever done before, both things I don’t do now I’m at school. My time was my own, other than the calls of course. No commute, no stress of being around other people. I was confident, and it was the best time of my education. Now it’s gone, and I’m have panic attacks at school almost daily."

SirTalkALot406,unpopularopinion,1620563186.0,Biking sucks as an excercise,"So, I've biked a fair bit as a kid and young adult, and I never enjoyed it, not even a little bit. Since then I always thought I just disliked exercise. You know, average lazy guy who doesn't like cardio.

But I was mistaken. I've always enjoyed swimming a fair bit, but recently I tried jogging, and it's a lot nicer than I thought excercise could be, especially when I managed 5km for the first time, I really just enjoyed myself while making my legs move fast, but not too fast.

So why is it, that I hate biking so much, when I actually like excercise?

For one, it is a long drag and a waste of time. I enjoy hiking, but mainly as a way to have a chat while experiencing nature. You don't get that with biking, you can't talk without being run over. With biking you also do the same repetitive motion over and over again, usually for hours on end, and you get nothing out of it, that a sport which isn't as repetitive and drawn out wouldn't give you.

But oh, while bikers can be annoying, mountain bikers are straight up obnoxious. Everywhere you look on the internet, people tell you it's ""oh so much fun"". Well, guess what, I tried mountain biking a bunch of times, with good gear and a good bike. Let me tell you, it fucking sucks.

You start with going up a hill, which is probably the most painful and depressing form of excercise I've ever tried. No matter which gear, no matter which pace, I'd much rather get off the bike and just walk, because then I could at least enjoy the nature, a chat and not become suicidal over a form of excercise.

Next up is the downhill, which everyone claims to be great and fun and whatnot. But what it essentially is, is going fast while risking your life, being in beautiful nature, but instead of looking at trees, you're focussed on a couple rocks that will almost make you crash.

It sucks, nothing about mountainbiking or regular biking is fun to me, and I'd much rather hike, walk, run, swim or drive, at least that isn't as repetitive a motion, and with driving you can actually go fast without risking your life."
E-nygma7000,unpopularopinion,1620626800.0,"Retail workers, are not understated or heroes.","Ok quick disclaimer, there’s a minority of retail workers, who go the extra mile. And are worth every penny they get paid, and more. But most of the ones I’ve met, are rude, lazy, sloppy, disinterested, unhelpful, etc etc. Just because they have “bad” jobs/pay, doesn’t mean they deserve better. If they don’t like their jobs, or the amount of money they’re being paid. They should either work harder to gain a promotion. Or find better jobs, if they don’t have the qualifications, they should go back into education. Take night classes if they can’t afford to go full time. Like I said, that hard working minority do deserve better, but the majority who don’t care about hard work. Do not, they did everything to themselves. And they amount of people, saying that they’re underrated, and heroes is unbelievable. 

TLDR: retail workers who don’t care for their jobs or work. Don’t deserve better pay, and are not heroes."

Jdogy2002,unpopularopinion,1620638455.0,I don’t think Bikers are tough or scary. They’re mostly just dudes having a midlife crisis and buying a Harley.,"I work at a bar in the Midwest and these fuckers are a dime a dozen here. They all act the exact same way. I have the misfortune of knowing quite a few of these fellas, and for all their bravado: “I’m a free spirit man, it’s just me and my bike out on the open road! I’m an individual that no one can hold down!” , they are all cookie cutter, carbon copies of one another. I like riding motorcycles when I get the chance when I travel, and by all means, live your life and have a blast. But they all say the same shit and sound like they are reading off a fucking script. Their entire identity is an image of something that doesn’t exist anymore. They all wear the exact same clothes, listen to the exact same music (trust me tough guy, you aren’t a rebel for playing ‘Copperhead Road’ for the 20th time in the last 2 hours) and say the exact same shit. If a guy has a white beard, a bandana, and a Harley shirt I can literally tell you half the things about him as an “individual”. The worst part though is that they all subscribe to this narrative that the world is *afraid* of Bikers. They say things and post things like “Don’t let my beard and Harley shirt and motorcycle fool you, I actually am a nice guy.” Who are these people that are afraid of Motorcycle people in bars in 2021? No one gives a fuck you have a Motorcycle there, Marlon Brando. When I see these cats it just seems like some old dude trying to still pretend he’s tough. I know there’s actual biker gangs and more than a few tough bikers still out there, but most of the people spouting this shit are just old dudes who bought an expensive motorcycle. And guess what. I don’t really give a fuck. I’ve seen a supposed “tough” biker get his ass beat to the ground by a guy who *literally* drove off in a Prius. Real talk. I’m tired of this Biker Bullshit. I don’t care how you got to the fucking bar, tough guy."

amboyurbex,unpopularopinion,1620497619.0,I think popular photographers on social media are shills for photo/travel companies,"Popular and rising photographers on social media lately have me scratching my head with many questions. I can be a little cynical, but it seems to me that as of late (maybe the past year or so) there's this guerilla marketing campaign going on trying to tap into photographers, wannabe photographers, and wanderlust-ers.

This typically happens on Twitter I've noticed, where these photographers shoot up in popularity, but the same photographers in question do maybe half as well on Instagram - though they tend to gravatate towards Twitter. The general theme is often this travel/wanderlust thing, and they all mostly identify as lonely and air out their problematic past. Theses photographers, when they identify themselves are all extremely young and good looking, and spend an inordinate amount of time on social media, despite their wandering/always shooting lifestyles. Many even cry poverty despite presumably having expensive gear to shoot and edit with, and nice clean clothes and well groomed... their entire existence on social media is shooting, shooting, shooting and seemingly existing in some unattainable reality. Nothing about their jobs or anything like that.

Some I've seen have had legal troubles (like getting caught trespassing and the like) which stirs up the right amount of drama... only for it to drop. Others talk about depression, drug use, and other issues, despite that stuff not affecting their consistent output. All trying to appear relatable to those following.

I have been shooting for 20 years and yes, that kind of life sounds exciting, but photography is expensive (almost prohibitively so) and hard to break out, and that lifestyle is not cheap. I have been published, gone viral, and all those things, but my following never blew up. I know photographers who do the same, and dealt with what I deal with. A couple made deals with photo related companies like Nikon and Sony, and boom, their lifestyle changes a little and their followings shoot up.

I can't put my finger on it and I know I sound like a conspiracy nut, but it's hard for me to look past it now. These photographers are talented, don't get me wrong, but I really can't shake the feeling they aren't representing themselves alone and that they are well funded and equipped as well as assisted. Almost every ""normal"" photographer I know doing the grind says social media is a time suck, editing is a time suck, and shooting in itself can take up time outside of just dealing with life... yet these super-shooters seem to put out content like a team is helping. And that's what makes me scratch my head.

And it's not to say it can't be done at all or that very talented folks don't deserve a big following. Nor do I think all extremely talented, well followed photographers are shills. I don't know. It's just bizarre."
LicensedTwoPill,unpopularopinion,1620507631.0,I can’t empathize with people who’s poor life decisions have lead to a terminal illness or death.,"For example, this is in regards to someone who smokes 2 packs a day for 40 years and develops lung cancer, someone who drinks way more than moderation and develops cirrhosis, someone who eats terrible and doesn’t exercise and has a heart attack, someone who decides to drive drunk and gets in a car crash, etc. I’m NOT saying these people are bad people or are lesser of a person, at all.

4seasons8519,unpopularopinion,1620599907.0,There's nothing wrong with being proud of your cultural background even if it's only a small percentage and you've never lived in the country from that background.,"I've seen recently some criticism that it's strange when people in the U.S. say that they are Irish American or Italian American,  etc and they only have a small percentage of that in their background.  And they grew up in the U.S.  

I am proud of my German and Swedish background.  My great grandparents came from Germany and Sweden.  I have some very old letters from when they were younger in German and Swedish. I have some items that came from those countries when they immigrated here. I am proud of that. 

I think the issues are if people one, think they are superior to another person because of their cultural background, two try to correct those people who actually live in the country, and three when it becomes an obsession.  Otherwise,  there's no shame in it."
GeneReddit123,unpopularopinion,1620566948.0,"Contrary to what memes say, if Dad (or anyone else) says they don’t want a dog or cat, you don’t “get a dog/cat anyways”, you respect their damn wish.","Posting because it’s Mother’s Day today, and Father’s Day not long after.

For every happy-come-around “Dad and the dog:” meme, there are far more animals that don’t do well when gifted to humans that didn’t actually want them. They end up unloved, neglected, given up to shelters, or worse.

And you can’t even put the blame fully on the owner because guess what, THEY CLEARLY SAID THEY DIDN’T WANT THE DAMN PET TO BEGIN WITH!

It’s also clearly disrespectful to the would-be owner. They may have reasons they can’t or don’t want to care for a pet. They might not have the right living space. They might not have enough money or time to care for one. They may have allergies. Or guess what, they’re just not a pet person. 

You don’t get to satisfy your own desire for being around a pet by dumping the responsibility to care for one on someone else. If you want a pet, get one yourself, and care for one yourself. If someone says they don’t want a pet, it’s their choice. Leave them alone, dammit."

LividRooster6,unpopularopinion,1620568846.0,Whataboutism is not a fallacy,"In the context of saying that someone or something is worse than the other, Whataboutism is a completely valid defense, for example if someone says that your vegetable shop is the worst in town because you sell some rotten vegetables, saying ""what about the butcher who sells expired meat"" or ""what about ice cream man who stores his ice cream unsanitary"" etc, is a completely fair way of debunking the claim that ""your worse than everyone else on the basis of x"", if someone acts in a way towards you that indicates that your uniquely bad compared to those around you, whataboutism is a logical way of proving that statement wrong, another example is if a town didn't want you to move there because you've been in prison for embezzlement, on the basis that if a single criminal moves in the town would be ruined or become less safe, it's completely valid to say ""what about the family who has a murderer living with them"" to disprove the claim that just because you're an ex con that you're any worse of a danger to safety  than those around you, because it's completely illogical to claim that someone is especially dangerous to a community for being a non violent criminal, when there's already people in the neighborhood who commit worse crimes.

In my view, terms like Whataboutism, fallacy this or fallacy that, are just millennial buzzwords for pseudo intellectuals, if anything is a logical fallacy, it's trying really hard to brush off someone as using fallacies to dodge their criticism."

techtonik25,unpopularopinion,1620647749.0,Smore's is an absolute garbage of a dessert.,"Its supposedly the dessert of choice when going camping. You roast your marshmallow over the fire and sandwich it between graham crackers and chocolate. Good idea.

Unfortunately, the experience of eating this god awful thing couldn't be more inconvenient and frustrating. Once assembled, you absolutely need to hold it firmly with both hands because, contrarily to, say, a grilled cheese, the ingredients are not all melted between the crackers so there's no ""glue"" to hold it all together.

There's also the ""hard taco shell"" problem: upon your first bite, the crackers will inevitably shatter, spilling your fillings all over the ground and yourself because honestly, who eats smore's in a plate? This problem costs me about 30% of my smore's every time.

It might just be the fact that my graham crackers are too thick, but holy shit that dessert is so DRY. I have to chug a gallon of water for it to pass. It would certainly help if the chocolate was melted though so it could seep a bit into the crackers, but you would need to burn your marshmallow to a crisp before it had enough heat on its own to melt the chocolate. Even if you do manage to heat everything properly, you only have a few minutes before everything gets cold and even drier.

Finally, this one is 100% subjective but, I simply cannot continue eating smore's after a couple bites. After chewing on almost pure caramelized sugar and sweet milk chocolate a couple times I find myself feeling sick of the sugar. 

Tldr: Hard to handle, messy, dry, overly sweet."

Not saying that swearing is a good thing, but if you call someone's parents for saying a bad word, then it's just wasting their time, in my opinion.

Simian_DustinP,unpopularopinion,1620507241.0,"Halo Top's ""Stop Shoulding Yourself"" ad campaign is gross and hypersexualizes ice cream"," First, there was the commercial featuring a plus-sized woman jubilantly dancing around in her underwear and bra to Lady Bri's 'Just Watch Me Now.' Secondly, there is a more recent commercial featuring two guys on the beach. For whatever reason, they start dancing (possible because they hear the song in the background, Jax Anderson's 'Good Day' but likely not), because that's what plus-sized guys do at random to celebrate their bodies. The weird part is around :23 seconds in when the guy eating ice cream closes his eyes and tilts his head back with his mouth open... I doubt the ice cream is *that* good. These ad campaigns try to position the ice cream as a more healthy alternative to other ice cream products while also spreading body positivity. Still, this ad campaign misses the point, you don't need to sexualize plus-sized people to accept them and sexualizing ice cream (Any food outside that used for hen parties an' such) is a dumb marketing move.

FiteMeHore,unpopularopinion,1620436438.0,The West Coast is incredibly overrated,"So, I moved to the west coast a few years ago thinking that I was going to find this great place full of open minded people, stunning cities, and a unmatched lifestyle. Instead, over the years I've discovered, that while the nature and weather are great, and the tech economy is healthy, there is not much else here that is ""great"".

1. There are homeless people EVERYWHERE and they litter the streets with trash and fill up the parks with these pseudo tent cities. It makes walking anywhere make you feel like you're walking in a dystopia.

2. The housing situation sucks all around. In the Pacific Northwest, most houses are these dilapidated shanties that are falling apart from wood rot and mold. But because there is limited space to grow, these sh\*tholes sell for 300 to 400 thousand dollars - beyond what most people can afford. In California the houses are nicer...but they go for millions. 

3. If you don't work in tech or medicine or finance, get f\*cked, because you are going to make enough to live on your own here without roommates. And that is if you're lucky enough to get a good job at all- competition is so fierce that unless you have years of experience you're just not going to get call backs.

4. The people are fucking stuck up. Most people who are from here have hardly seen the rest of the country yet they act like they're better than everyone else. They don't give you the time of day, are flaky and non-commital. It's so frustrating.

I went to visit a small city in the rust belt recently. From all the things I've heard from people where I'm from, I had these images in my head I was going to be heading into a disaster of a community. And it turns out my pre-concieved notions were entirely false. In fact, this small city I went to was better than my home back west. Homes are affordable; there aren't f\*cking homeless people everywhere. There is an economy beyond just working for wokemegatechcorp2021.

GreenFriday13,unpopularopinion,1620487291.0,Parents should stop calling their children 'geniuses',"I know the title is pretty vague, but let me explain. I've heard quite a few cases on the internet where students in secondary are struggling and falling behind their peers or expectations because their parents and other adults called them 'geniuses' in primary.

The bad thing about calling children a 'genius' is that parents who say that are forcing the idea that these students' talents are far beyond their peers. This is the difference between complementing someone by calling them smart and boosting their ego and making them deluded.

It sounds harsh, but I have every right to say this because ever since I was a child in primary, my mother would call me a 'genius' and say that I'm talented in various subjects. This literally created a very harmful ego and confidence within me which made me think that I was simply born smarter than my classmates.

This made me think that I don't need to study as much as others because I was a 'genius'. Most children with parents that say that always got better grades than their peers in class in primary, which enforced this delusion that they can achieve the same grades with less effort.

Victims of this in the internet said that this belief hindered their academic development in Secondary, where you actually need to pick your shit up and study hard to get good grades. While their friends with worse grades in primary were studying harder and picking up experience in studying and getting more disciplined, they were putting less effort because they thought they were smart enough to be lazier.

This is part of the reason why some of the smarter students in primary and even in early secondary suddenly drop off in their grades and make less progress in comparison to their classmates who simply became smarter and matured more by studying more. Primary grades don't reflect how your child is gonna do like 6 years in the future where grades in GCSES and A level/IB actually matter.

Don't just call them 'geniuses' and make fun of their classmates in primary, encourage them with compliments, but always remind them that their true tests will come in secondary, where they need more than 'talent' and humble them so they will continue to put their best efforts when studying."

It's okay.

We're still in the middle of a pandemic that has turned the world upside down for tons of people. Some people have lost family to COVID-19, suffered from it themselves, lost their jobs, been evicted, been forced to choose between their child's education or their job that covers basic needs during a global pandemic, had trips they planned a year out canceled, had severe depressive episodes, not been able to see family for a whole year, or had to wait in a food bank line for the first time in their life, and I'm quite sure there's a whole laundry list of other horrible things people have been through because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Amphibians are experiencing a [rapid decline in populations with mass extinctions of many amphibian species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_in_amphibian_populations).   Quoting that Wikipedia page:

>> The decline in amphibian populations is an ongoing mass extinction of amphibian species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are known as one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity. 

While it's considered trendy to hate on cane toads on reddit and brag about hitting them with golf clubs -- perhaps some day we will appreciate Cane Toads for keeping that entire Animal Kingdom alive in the face of otherwise mass extinctions.

It's kinda nice that there is at least one successful species in that kingdom - and perhaps Cane Toads will diverge into many new species that'll fill the ecological niches to replace the frogs and toads who's survival traits aren't well suited for co-existing in modern society.

And all the concern about ""not native"" may be viewed differently in the light of climate change.  As the climate changes - fragile species (like amphibians) can not continue to survive in their historical homelands where the climate changes out from under them.    They will need to re-locate to somewhere better suited to their survival - which is almost by definition not their native range."

Some people are born with an amazing singing voices or artistic skills despite never taking any professional lessons because they're just born with that talent. Just like some people are born with perfect bone structure, eyes, skin etc. 

Similar to talents, beauty can be enhanced through dedication to a proper diet, exercise, skin routine etc. Models can become millionaires based of their attractiveness alone. Yes, it's a shallow talent and far less valuable to society but in its own way it's kinda a talent."

Integrable03,unpopularopinion,1620497586.0,Ludwig Göransson is overall a better film composer than Hans Zimmer,"I know this opinion will flame quite alot of Hans Zimmer stans, but hear me out.
Firstly, I realize it isnt quite fair to compare an extremely seasoned film composer like Hans with over 100 film credits under his belt to a relatively young (Ludwig is only 36) composer who does not have nearly as many films.

However, the fact that despite Ludwig being so young he has accomplished so much in a short time says alot about his talent (and of course, luck).

Aside from comparing them in non-musicial elements like fame and accolades, Ludwig's melodic, harmonic and rhythmic content is more sophisticated and intricate than that of Zimmer's, who only really shines in his signature bombastic Zimmer beats over traditional ""heroic"" chords (atleast only recently, post-Lion King phase). 

Then again, Ludwig is obviously heavily inspired by Zimmer's abstract approach to his craft therefore it isn't too fair to compare them in this way. Also, Zimmer comes from a pop background without formal education whereas Ludwig thoroughly studied film music as well as jazz, so it is inevitable that Ludwig's music will have more sophistication in terms of music (sound design wise, Hans zimmer is better probably)

To summarize, just the fact that virtually everything Ludwig has touched has been quite phenomenal (even in the early days) says alot: all the way from jingles on Community, to big-budget action films and TV shows like Black Panther, The Mandalorian and Tenet, all of which are absolutely phenomenal and truly push the boundaries of music for media, as Hans once did as well with his signature sound."
mac_128,unpopularopinion,1620541270.0,Poor vs Rich mindset comparisons aren’t insightful at all,"Anyone who has seen stuff from the self-help industry and hustle culture pages would know what I mean. There is constantly this poor vs rich mindset comparison, reducing the factors of one‘s financial situation to an oversimplified factor such as “Rich people invest with their money , poor people buy stuff with their money” “Rich people create value, poor people only consume value” and my favorite, a picture of a rich man’s outfit consisting of $20 plain T-shirts and jeans, and a poor man’s outfit of Supreme Tees, Rolex Watches, Gucci belts, and Yeezys. 
First of all, if you earn so much that your basic necessities can be covered by 1% of your income, any idiot would invest some of it, and 2. If someone can afford a $9000 outfit, it is unlikely that they’re poor. I’ve never seen a poor person dress like that. 

As someone who has been both poor and financially stable while having both rich friends and poor friends, I think most of it is bullshit. Rich people invest because they can, and tend to consume a lot more than poor people. A lot of it comes down to luck. The way these pages put it is just like saying “Lebron James invests millions of dollars each year on training and maintaining his body while regular Joes only spend $70 each month on fitness and Gym memberships, that’s why you aren’t one of the best players in the NBA” 

Can poor people learn a thing or two from the rich? Absolutely, especially if they are really bad with money and lack practical knowledge. However, I never see any practical advice on these pages, it seems like it’s only there to glorify the rich as some sort of wise, disciplined, and hardworking  species as opposed to the dumb, greedy and lazy poor people, and provide empty carb motivation energy that offers nothing to those who want to better their lives."

However, I honestly think that having this mindset takes so much joy out of life and prevents us from fully experiencing the beauty of something as profound as the human connection. If you learn and grow and experience LIFE in that relationship—no matter how fleeting or finite it may be—*how* is it exactly a waste of time? Think about it: of the nearly 8 billion people on this planet, you happened to cross paths and share a meaningful connection with *this* particular human being in this particular part of your journey through life. I think that in and of itself is a worthy enough reason to relish in this person’s presence for however long that may be.

Maybe not all examples of that kind of seriousness but just unpleasant stuff like that.

Yeah, a part of me could tell that this is an unpopular opinion, and I'm gonna say it anyway.

In my opinion, trying to mess with others and make them feel lesser upon doing so for the sake of your time not being ""Boring"", is selfish and just plain makes yourself unpleasant to be with.

If you really want to not be bored, maybe you should just find something else to have a better time with instead of trying to screw someone's head for yourself.

People call men predators for wanting to date women who are younger than them and women who choose to date older men are victims and must have been “groomed”. 

Whilst this may be the case for some women, this is not the case for all women. Why is having a toxic relationship with someone your own age better than having a toxic relationship with someone older than you? 

Also it is completely contested by the fact that today’s society completely glorifies and sexualises young women, so why shouldn’t men of any age find that attractive? (I’m still talking about women above the age of consent.)

My question is, as a woman myself, when do women stop being victims? Even when they’re above the legal age requirement we’re still told we’re the unwitting victims waiting for a predator to attack. Why aren’t they allowed to date someone who is a lot older than them without people calling their partner dirty?

Shannnnnnn,unpopularopinion,1620466545.0,Growling makes heavy metal songs worse,"I am not a big big fan of heavy metal and all it's subgenres but I love some bands and some songs. I also very much enjoy the ""pure"" music like the play of bass, guitar and drums but if the singer starts growling it kinda makes the song worse. It appears so pointless, like you don't understand what he says, why even have lyrics to the song? I know there is a certain art to it because growling requires a lot of training but for me it just doesn't add anything a real good vocal couldn't add.
Like for example this one

his voice is fucking dank, fits the song and even the screaming part just transfers a lot of power.

Moodymoomoo94,unpopularopinion,1620591148.0,I think letting your dog poop outside is more gross than letting your dog poop on potty pad inside.,"Let me elaborate. When you take your dog to poop outside in public areas, you don’t know how many other dogs have pooped in the same place. Your dog might be stepping over many different dog’s poop and pee residue. After your dog poop outside, you would still have to pick up the poop (im assuming you’re a decent human being). In the process of picking up pick, I’m sure you will accidentally graze your hands with the bare poop at least once in a while when in process of picking it up and finding trash can to throw it away.

If you have your own backyard and don’t clean up your dog’s poop, that just means he’s stepping all over it every time he’s outside and tracking it inside the house. Also when it rains and he goes outside, imagine all the gross mud and wet poop he tracks inside. 

A lot of people think puppy pads are gross and unsanitary but I think that it’s cleaner provided that your dog is trained to poop 100% on the potty pad. I have a poop scooper and I use that to pick up the poop and I’m always at least 3 feet away from the poop using the poop scooper. My bathroom is right next to his puppy pad so I flush that shit down the toilet right after. He doesn’t have outside when it’s cold and rainy and track mud and old poop inside. I clean it up quite quickly and easily. Flush it down the toilet and throw away puppy pad.

Now don’t get me wrong, I still take my dog out to pee and poop but since he needs to go out every 3-4 hours as a puppy. I just find it so much more gross to take him out that often and he usually tracks bugs, grass and mud inside the house then I have to bathe him more often. 

Basically I take my dog out when it’s not raining as much as I can. If I can’t, he pees and poop on potty pad consistently. If it rains, he’s staying inside. I rather clean up poop from potty pad and flush down toilet than to have him go outside in the rain and be even dirtier. I just don’t get what the hate for potty pad is. They’re so useful and I get grossed out by owners that let their dogs go out in rain to pee and poop and they come inside, don’t get cleaned or wiped down then jump all over the furniture you’re sitting on."

damthatriver18,unpopularopinion,1620512202.0,Cryptocurrency is a shitty idea.,"1. It doesn't even get used as a currency. Its just traded for fiat money in hopes that it will gain value. Its like trading precious metals except without their usefulness. Gold, for example, is used in electronic circuits thus creating a demand through utility. I can't sell crypto to any industry for any use.

  Fiat currency has legally enforced value whereas crypto is out to dispace fiat without backing of its own. I wouldn't except crypto payment for any major purchase. If I sell my house for so many crypto credits I'm taking a huge gamble that speculation is going to keep the value high. I may as well trade in barrels of gasoline because I can at least use it to get me to work should the value tank.

2. It's not environmentally friendly. It uses electricity on the scale of entire European countries, and I highly doubt that it comes entirely from carbon free sources. The green energy problem still isn't solved and crypto is making it worse. If you have evidence that crypto is driving the demand for green electricity, I would like to see it. Most of us are aware of climate change and want to see green energy regardless of the demand for an electricity dependent currency."

My sister and I are four years apart, we have no other siblings, and the entire time we were growing up I feel like we were just homies. Like yeah, at one point mom and dad both worked out of the house, but my sister and I were both raised to be fairly independent. Obviously, I still looked out for her, but it's not like I had to worry about her getting into any trouble because... we never put ourselves in potentially dangerous situations anyway. Our parents taught us how to make easy meals like ramen, canned lasagna, sandwiches, frozen dinners, etc. and we just ate on our own time if our parents weren't home during meal times. I never felt like my relationship with my sister resembled anything parental and neither did she.

If you expect your eldest child to help raise your younger children, you did not do a good job planning your family. That is completely unfair to your eldest, why should they sacrifice their time to develop their own identity to take care of kids they didn't choose to have? I'm not a psychologist but I don't see how expecting to act in an adult role wouldn't affect someone's psyche when they are still a child themselves and still developing. If you choose to be a parent then you need to be prepared to provide adequate attention and care for your children under any and all circumstances. Obviously, certain extreme situations cannot be completely prepared for — like a natural disaster or something — but you should at least be confident that you can step up to the plate and be the role model that your kids will need you to be. You cannot fall back on your eldest child if you slip up. They are still a child, they should not have that kind of responsibility."

Then their DMs became more and more like that of KiK and Snapchat’s as well as regular SMS. Facebook, FB Messenger, and Twitter then added a stories feature to their apps, and now they seem to be adding their own version of TikTok as well to their apps. I think that this will ruin the popularity and use of each app the more they change, and especially to developing apps and apps that have yet to copy features of others. Each app used to be its own thing. Instagram was for permanent photos, Snapchat for daily updates that were quick and gone, Twitter for quick messages, and Facebook for... whatever Facebook is. Also, apps are adding so many features that it’s hard to keep up with them. I went to someone’s Instagram profile, and there were so many tans of photos and videos that I couldn’t tell them apart from each other. It over complicates apps and makes it harder for new ones to be made since all other apps have “everything you want in one app”. I think this will just make social media a blob of the same things over and over, just with different names (TikTok, Reels, Spotlights, etc.)"

seeyaintherapy,unpopularopinion,1620650157.0,There is an unjustifiable surge in the amount of women who feel entitled to be or want to be celebrated on Mother's Day.,"I am a stepmother. My step son is 5, turning 6 in a couple weeks, and I have been in his life since he was just over 2 years old. I am also a cat mom and had a shih tzu that I loved dearly.

Yesterday, I saw a post by a woman who wanted to wish step-mothers a happy mother's day, especially considering the ""heart-breaking"" fact that their step-kids will be leaving to go spend the day with their biological mothers. Why it would be heartbreaking for a child to spend the day with his mother on mother's day is beyond me but, okay, sure. I accept.

Then reading down the comments, OP states that she wasn't ""heartbroken"" last year, because last year she did not even know her step-child. So in less than one year of knowing your step-kid, you're now entitled to call yourself a mother, *and* have the audacity to be upset that the child is only recognizing their *actual* mother on Mother's Day? You do not become a mother after sharing 50/50 custody with the actual mother for less than one year. If the child in less than one year recognizes you as a mom, that's a different story. But it is nothing you are entitled to.

You also do not become a mother by virtue of adopting a pet. I call myself a cat mom, and you can call yourself a dog mom, but to then extend this to wanting recognition on Mother's Day is just completely outrageous. Dogs and cats do not require even a fraction of the time, effort and work a child requires.

Unless you've actually birthed a child or have been a step-parent to a child for many years, you are not a mother. And you are not entitled to be celebrated on Mother's Day."

His voice is very, VERY normal. Not deep, not shrill, just an average person's voice. There are many people out there with truly unique voice. And you can clearly hear it. But in case of Morgan Freeman, I do not hear it at all. Just an adult male speaking, nothing fancy about it."
bcnelson1201,unpopularopinion,1620607161.0,Canada is Overrated (at least in America),"I'd like to start by noting that Canada is a decent country in most regards, but we definitely think to highly of it here in the U.S. Here are just a couple of reasons why I tend to believe that Canada is indeed overrated.

My mother has friends in Canada that live with intense COVID restrictions  that do not allow them to even attend religious services. They have been in pseudo-lockdown since at least last March (2020). They must also quarantine if they ever leave the country and quarantine when they return. 

Unrelated, but it is important to remember that Canada does not protect many rights we take for granted here in America like freedom of speech. You can be fined or arrested for saying things the Canadian government finds unpalatable. There are many other reasons, but I will let you folks fill in if you'd like."
ToesyToeNails,unpopularopinion,1620632023.0,Mother's Day is a consumerist holiday preying on sentiment,"This rings true for Father's Day too. You don't need a calander to tell you when to reserve a day for somebody. The majority of gifts are the same copy and pasted things such as cards, mugs, shirts, chocolate etc. There's no thought behind these, it's bought because the gifts buy into the overall theme of ""mother's fay"" or ""father's day"" or even ""St Patricks day"". I live in the UK and for whatever reason, we have our mothers day in March. If it's such an important day, why is it not celebrated at the same time all over the world? 

You can appreciate your parents on any given day or multiple times a year. You don't need a calander to reserve a special day for you. It makes it disingenuous because if it wasn't mothers or fathers day, they'd be getting none of that attention. It's not coming from you as an individual, it's coming from a holiday that's soul purpose is to capitalise on a made up holiday to sell otherwise unneeded merch.

Celebrating your parents = good

Celebrating your parents because the calander told you to on an arbitrary holiday = bad"

divertss,unpopularopinion,1620533687.0,"If you own your house and have a yard, there’s no reason not to grow at least some perennial food plants.","Perennials don’t really require much maintenance. No tilling, no planting, no watering (unless you plant non local native species). With a yard of grass you sacrifice time every week just to maintain it. Sacrifice money in gas for lawn mower and maintenance on the mower. Just to uphold some thought-up standard of landscaping beauty. You might as well utilize your space to reduce grocery store bills. Maybe your whole yard doesn’t have to be that way, but why would you not have any of your yard be that way? Perennial food forests are very efficient and a couple showed this by growing 7,000lbs of food on 1/10th of an acre in a year. I’m not anti grass. Having an open view, a place to run and play is amazing. But to not have any food on your land at all is insane to me. As we’ve seen during the pandemic our supply chains are fragile. We saw toilet paper and other essentials disappear and people lose their minds. The thought of a food shortage in a first world country is unfathomable, but this pandemic should’ve awakened people to see that if you can’t produce it on your own, you’re not guaranteed to get it. Your food comes from so far away and must go through a number of points along the supply chain before it reaches the grocery store and then ultimately your house. Any one of those points from farm field to your house, has the potential to be disrupted. Again, not growing at least some food blows my mind. When I get a house, I will definitely have grass. But I will also strive to grow fruits and veggies that I could eat throughout the year. Self sufficiency has always been important to me, I think it should be important to everyone."

Riverdale is a teen thriller series on the CW and Netflix that combines elements of many different time periods and genres of mystery and suspense. It's 5 seasons are some of the most viewed on Netflix across the world.

A little bit like sweating, defecating, urinating and things of that nature. And let's be honest. Bodily functions like that are kind of gross and are usually kind of gross to discuss just casually like that. I mean, take for example pooping. You wouldn't just go on about how you took the biggest dump ever. Nobody wants to hear that because it's kind of gross. Likewise, it's the same thing with periods. There's nothing misogynistic about it it's just something kind of gross that people don't want to hear about, particularly when they're eating. And while we are on the subject free bleeding is gross and unsanitary. There's nothing misogynistic about saying that. Much like veinous blood, saliva, poop, piss, sweat and cum period blood is a bodily fluid which means it carries a lot of bacteria and is not sanitary. Not to mention it carries some actual blood inside of it which means that if a person comes into contact with that that they could be exposed to a lot of blood-borne diseases including hepatitis and HIV. Not to mention it would get all over everything. Free bleeding is just not sanitary and impractical and I don't think it's misogynistic to say that."

Centuries of wealthy people owning the poor indirectly, millennia of the upper classes twisting the lower classes to wage wars, show them off for politics, or just simply absorb their wealth.

MundaneResurrection,unpopularopinion,1620451933.0,Being smart is not a curse and is better than being average or dumb.,"I'm tired of smart people complaining about being smart because being smart is a net advantage in life. I wish I was smart because then I would've had a realistic chance of retiring in my 20's. Most lucrative occupations are basically reserved for smart people because companies want people who can learn new things as quickly as possible. Time is money after all. Most people are doomed to spend the rest of their lives slogging away as cashiers ditch diggers or some shit like that because they lack the ability to do something that pays significantly more. Although there are obvious exceptions (for example trust fund babies and attractive people) lackluster intelligence is the true barrier to social mobility in first world countries.

Being smart isn't just an advantage in school and work. Although there are plenty of unhappy smart people they aren't the norm because there's a modest correlation between intelligence and happiness.  Correlation doesn't equal causation. However higher intelligence (all else equal) makes it significantly easier to have a higher income and that financial security makes people happier.

TL;DR: I'm in my late 20's and don't want to wait until I'm old to do so but I fear that I can't because I'm not smart enough to work in a high-paying occupation - hence my contempt for people who insist that being smart is a curse."

I don’t hate this out of jealousy. It feels like a huge breach in privacy on the guy who confessed’s part. One instance that particularly bothers me is when a close guy friend of mine moved away, he secretly told this girl in our friend group that he had feelings. Might as well get it out now and all. While he was away, my friend group went to a birthday party (pre Covid of course) and the gal basically told everyone that my friend told her he had a crush on her. That party had more than 30 people (big friend group) It wasn’t even in topic. I was somewhat angry at this, as she revealed something personal. Whenever I get love confessions that I turn down, I don’t tell anyone. It’s not anyone else’s business. Hell, it isn’t even MY business. It doesn’t have to be this whole thing, but the gals in my life constantly broadcast that shit like TMZ. Another instance that comes to mind is when I texted another female friend who was out of state in the East for college and I wanted to check in with her. The exchange started with me asking how she was. Her answer was—and I quote—“good, just found out like 7 people are in love with me lol”. It took everything in my mortal soul to say “I don’t care.” Because I don’t.

Therefore, the very premise of health regulation is pseudoscience. The FDA is the very thing its proponents claim that it protects us from.

EDIT: the primary counter argument is to give a concrete examples of a particular thing a health agency may mandate, like washing your hands before returning to work. It shows an inability to grasp the concept of regulation and differentiate it from the particular things the government mandates. Government did not invent hand washing, and humanity would not lose the knowledge of it just because the government stopped mandating it. There is no evidence nor reason to believe that government mandates make people any more likely to follow good health practices."

river_runn,unpopularopinion,1620514101.0,Blade Runner 2049 is overrated,"This movie is all surface--beautiful surface--and no substance. When you watch it next to the original Blade Runner, its hollowness and superficiality are overwhelming. Typical Villeneuve--his movies are so empty, such perfect expressions of the zeitgeist. There are no deeper questions, no riffing on the cinematic genre, no interest in Harrison Ford's character, no likeable or interesting characters at all. Plus the lead actor's performance is beyond wooden--I get that he's a replicant, but seriously, as an actor he's just lazy, unwatchable. The whole movie a kind of adolescent, comic-book imagining of Blade Runner. Rutger Hauer's response sums it up: ""In many ways, Blade Runner wasn't about the replicants, it was about what does it mean to be human? It's like E.T.. But I'm not certain what the question was in the second Blade Runner. It's not a character-driven movie and there's no humor, there's no love, there's no soul. """

what i’m talking about is how people intentionally go out of their way to kill bugs who are just minding their own business in the grass. like people will be walking on the sidewalk and just see a spider in the grass and step on it. what is the point of that? all you’re doing is just killing something for the sake of killing it. i don’t understand how that isn’t more of a red flag.

Maxwell_Jeeves,unpopularopinion,1620609214.0,Outlawing Combustion Engines is not good for most people,"To start, protecting the environment is a worthwhile endeavor! However, Reddit is full of people making poverty wages supporting the switch to electric vehicles they will never be able to afford. Anyone suggesting the switch is premature gets downvoted into oblivion. The government doesn't care about you, and is not going to subsidize an EV in any meaningful way to make it an affordable alternative to combustion engine vehicles. A $5,000 used vehicle is a stretch to afford for a significant part of the population, and many have to take loans just to afford it. 

Here are the issues as I see them: 

Many folks live in areas where hookups for EV's are not practical, and electricity is expensive. Infrastructure is getting better, but its still not enough. 

Switching to EV's from combustion engines will make fuel more expensive as demand goes down. Exacerbating the problem of being able to afford a vehicle. 

You found an old used EV to purchase? Congrats, the battery is almost going to be useless if it has any significant use and age. They degrade over time. 

There are many major Cities in the US that do not have great public transportation options, and they are non existent in smaller communities.

Ultimately this switch will contribute further to the wealth inequality we are seeing in the US."
JuneBlues92,unpopularopinion,1620644983.0,Unless you love these people - don’t stick at a job if you “put your 2 weeks in” unless you really want or need to.,"Unless you work for genuinely good people whom you want to remain close to, or want a glowing reference, there is no reason you stick 2 more weeks in a place you hate IF you already have another job lined up. 

Especially if you don’t have PTO. But this is even true if you do. They won’t give you unused time, not in the times we’re living in anymore. 

You should be entitled to the PTO you worked for. There is no incentive for staying a 2 weeks notice if you don’t get that.

There is no sense in giving loyalty to a company you’re leaving. They will show you no decency. And I’m sorry, a glowing reference isn’t even a guarantee in this scenario anymore, actually. 

I’m not gonna say all places do this, but it’s becoming commonplace to not give employees unused PTO time.  I remember back in 2016, I hated my job as an office coordinator so I put in a months notice (since I was a supervisor) and I got my unused vacation pay.

MeatloafAndWaffles,unpopularopinion,1620519526.0,I rooting for all the people walking out of their low paying retail/restaurant jobs,"Not sure how popular this is so sorry if it is popular. 

Every picture I see of a window with a sign that says something along the lines of “Closed: No workers.” “Closed: Employers refuse to pay more” “Closed: No one wants to work” brings a smile to my face. 

As someone who used to work in retail for minimum wage: right on! 

“But OP, these people are living off the gubbament teets” 

Man I don’t care. If these corporations refuse to pay workers more than Unemployment then that’s their problem. This “Labor Shortage” is one of many problems that could be solved by “throwing money at it”. 

Oh and sure they could replace the workers with “robots” and machines, but good luck dealing with customers who barely know how to turn on a computer.

EDIT: Going to address some common arguments.

“But OP, what about the small businesses? They’re suffering too? Do you not care for the little man?” 

Well, I never implied that small businesses should suffer. However, I’ll say this. If you’re planning on opening a business of your own you need to figure a more-than-minimum wage salary into your budget if you plan on hiring employees. If it’s impossible for you to make a profit based on that model, then you can go back to the drawing board or scrap the idea. You don’t have to pay your employees millions of dollars. But min wage won’t cut it. But hey, at the end of the day, do what you want. Not like I can make the rules. Pay your workers min wage, just have fun with the high turnover and low moral that comes with the territory. 

“Have fun paying $50 for a Whopper Jr.” 

Prices have been climbing for a while now my G, and yet most of the workers are still being paid the same amount of money. I’ve been alive long enough to remember McDonalds having a Dollar Menu, Wendy’s having a Dollar Menu, and Taco Bell selling items for as cheap as $0.79 (USD), and Subway selling questionably measured footlong subs for $5. Guess what? All that is gone now. Plus if I have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a Big Mac, then I just simply won’t eat at those establishments. Hell, I work a decent paying job and going out for lunch anywhere that isn’t a fast food burger joint runs about an average of $12-$15, especially if you want to stay on the “healthier” side. 

“Min. wage jobs are meant to be stepping stones. People need to get educated and find better paying jobs” 

Oh how I love this argument. You’re right, people can get educated and find better jobs. But wait a minute, school costs money. Which means people have to work for that money, especially if they didn’t get a scholarship. Oh that’s easy, they can work a decent paying job for tuition money, right? Oh but wait a decent paying job requires a degree, and the only jobs that are hiring “uneducated” workers are min wage jobs. No problem, I’ll just work at Taco Bell to pay my tuition. Oh but after doing the math I barely get paid enough to buy my books. After all, they won’t even schedule me to work 40 hours in a week because then they’d have to give me benefits. Which means I’ll have to take out a loan. Okay cool, I got student loans to help with tuition, I’ll just get a good job when I graduate. Well the day is finally here and I’m graduating college. It’s a great occasion, and yet I’m worried because Sally Mae Great Lakes is around the corner waiting on their money. No problem! I got my degree and I’m ready to work in a “skilled” workforce, can’t wait to quit my shitty job at Taco Bell where I only accumulated $2 
in raises over 4 years of working there. Oh but wait, the entry level jobs in my field require 5 years experience. And the one job that will hire inexperienced people is only paying $3 above the current minimum wage. Well now I’m in a pickle, I got a degree, I have to start paying off my loans in 6 months. I can either stay at Taco Bell or work in the field I studied in for a laughable amount of money. Yeah sure, I’ll eventually get promoted and make more money, but who knows when that will happen? 5 years from now. I need money now."

TurntPikachu,unpopularopinion,1620516314.0,Saying you’re not entitled to a relationship is a shitty mindset to have,"When people get hurt from being ghosted or led on, I’ve noticed a lot of people use the phrase, “Well you’re not entitled to a relationship with that person so get over it.” While that may be true, whatever happened to the belief that one should “Treat others the way you would like to be treated?” Chances are that the person ghosting or leading another person along wouldn’t like it either if the roles were swapped. We’re quick to tell someone they’re not entitled to a relationship, but slow to acknowledge that leading a person along as well as ghosting lack human decency to one another. 

We’re in a society where divorce, infidelity, and the general abandonment of monogamous relationships as a whole is high. Doesn’t this show that the way we communicate to one another is problematic and should be changed? People continue to dehumanize each other through their actions and validate them by saying no one is entitled to anything. The person who cares the least often “wins” because they end up not being hurt. If you’re haphazardly entering a relationship just to cut things off in such a dehumanizing way, whats the point of even attempting? Its causing a ripple effect that creates a more callous population who lack communication skills when conveying emotion because the person on the receiving end will make sure not to put their best foot forward in future relationship efforts again. 

I genuinely believe that if you want to develop a lasting relationship, you should treat them with the same dignity that you would like to be treated with. Sure you may not be entitled to a relationship with anyone, but you should be entitled to decent human courtesy when pursuing one as well as when ending one.

Being a parent isn’t just about being there for your kids financially either, if your child grows into an adult with mental health issues because of how they were raised then you, the parent, fucked up and you should probably take some responsibility for it. This logic contradicts most low quality parent’s opinions but facts are facts, when parents pull this garbage their children have a harder time adjusting to later life and it’s not just bad for the grown child it’s also bad for society, if you raised a child that became homeless because of your shortcomings they don’t owe you anything on parent day, suck it up and deal with your choices."

jbarrio5,unpopularopinion,1620488222.0,Insurance companies need personal injury attornies to exist.,"You see the billboards and tv ads everywhere, such and such law firm got me $500K for my accident, call them now. You would think that insurance companies with all their might and lobbying power would have had laws changed by now in their favor, but no, they are sued all the time.

So why is this? Why do they tolerate these attorneys? The explanation is simple. Insurance companies make a fixed percentage of profit from the sale of an insurance policy. So if you have auto insurance and pay $1200 a year, and they make let's say 10%, that's $120 profit.

Insurance companies raise premiums based on risk and payouts from claims (like when they get sued by an injury attorney). If claims and payouts dropped dramatically (like from [Tort Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_reform), google it) insurance premiums would drop dramatically, and in turn, so would their profits. Try making 10% of a $500 a year car insurance, that's only $50.

Insurance companies do not lose money when they are sued, they just pass on the buck to the consumers by raising their premiums, and thus increasing their profits.

So next time you see a billboard saying that an attorney got me $1 million for my car accident, think that somewhere in some insurance company they are opening another bottle of Crystal in celebration of their recent loss."

-Douche,unpopularopinion,1620601406.0,I honestly hate how society nowadays berates you if you don’t care about every social cause or (God forbid) disagree with it,"There is a certain capacity to which humans care about things. Getting angry because one does not care about a specific cause isn’t magically going to make them give a shit, it only makes it less appealing. People in the media talk down to the common people and tell us how to live our lives when most are out of touch or unknown criminals. 

As well as this, people also vilify you for disagreeing with the mainstream narrative for causes, which again, is stupid since humans will not agree about everything. If you go into the mega thread topics you’ll find that there are a list of hot button issues and the most down-voted ones go against the ideal view, and have a barrage of replies that don’t help the situation at all. No one has to agree on everything and people should hold whatever view they so wish."

I've tried eating it the regular way and it just isn't nearly as enjoyable for me. I don't do the same thing with cake (like eating the frosting first and then the cake), but I just can't eat pie the way ""normal"" people do. It's not that I don't enjoy the fillings, but that crust is my favorite part, and I like to savor it without the other flavors getting in the way."

We would absolutely destroy them in a war.,"Everyone assumes that if an advanced alien civilization found us they would have such insane military power we would never be able to fight back (even in movies it takes some 1 in a billion chance for humans to prevail). But the way I see it, the odds of another civilization being as advanced in warfare as earth is, and being advanced enough to find us is near impossible. We already have the power to destroy our own world in an instant so we have essentially maximized our destruction potential. Any civilization who surpasses humans in weapon technology would have surely killed itself off before it could go out into the universe. Basically I think if aliens find us they would be some passive race of explores that we could easy destroy if it came to war."

Designing a rocket that can land upright is neat, but just one of an absurd number of roadblocks we’ll need to overcome, most of which we probably don’t even know about or have the capacity to comprehend yet. It’s like watching a bunch of Vikings try to launch an expedition to the Mariana Trench. We will need multiple, successive technological if not scientific revolutions before we’re where we need to be to pull something like this off. By the time we are prepared, humans will be indistinguishable from our current iteration.

DariusIV,unpopularopinion,1620526992.0,Most doctors aren't that well educated with regard to health.,"Heres a real unpopular opinion, but most Doctors are general practitioners and GPs tend to ossify after medical school and only learn new shit from the pamphlets that pharmaceutical reps hand them to pitch new medications. Their medical knowledge is therefore 10, 20 or even several decades out of date half the time. The number of times I've heard about doctors giving advice that is generally unhelpful or woefully out of date is absurd.

Only Doctors in specialty fields or surgeons bother to keep up with the latest advancements in science, because it is their job. General practitioners just hand out pills and refer to specialists when that fails. The sad truth is that they aren't all that more knowledgeable than the average nurse with 2 years schooling or the sufficiently motivated general public on any particular issue. Even the medical field is acknowledging this, the ratio of nurses to doctors continues to more and more favor nurses.

The only helpful thing most General practitioners can do for you is order blood work, beyond that they are basically gate keepers to keep hypochondriacs from wasting specialists time. Thats a useful role for sure and preventive screen is very important, but you shouldn't treat medical advice as the word of god just because it came from your GP's mouth."

njghtljfe,unpopularopinion,1620439750.0,Metallica is one of the most overrated bands of all time.,"I can’t seem to figure out why people love Metallica so much. I’m a metal/hard rock fan myself, but can’t seem to enjoy most of Metallica’s discography.

First things first, I recognize the objective talent of Kirk and James, along with Cliff and Jason. They are all great musicians and are obviously good at what they do.

I have 2 main issues:

1) Every Metallica record pre-black album sounds utterly horrible. All the guitars sound so thin and wimpy, Jame’s singing is borderline unlistenable and usually cringeworthy. I don’t think I need to mention AJFA and St. Anger. The problems in production are pretty self-evident.

2) The riffs are pretty same-y and uninspired, in my opinion. Of course theres gems and they do have some of my all time favorite riffs, but it’s like theres no in between. Their riffs are either legendary or just plain boring. 

I will not sit here and say “uGh mEtAlLicA sUcKs!!” because they obviously do not suck, otherwise they wouldn’t be so popular. Guess their less-accessible stuff just isn’t for me. I’ve tried to get into their whole discography but couldn’t do it."
BarsRClosed,unpopularopinion,1620643620.0,In no way is life too short,"As a 5-year-old, I thought being 10 was like...the peak of childhood. Then I turned 10 and thought 13 was the peak, then it was 16, and 18, and 21. Now I'm 21 years old and I can barely comprehend the idea of me being 25. I have friends who are over 30 and some over 40 and they still got a long way to go. You're only out of ""the prime of your life"" when you're not active anymore really. There are people who are living in the prime of their life in their 60s! 

The whole idea of life being too short is young people scared of being old and they think being 30 is too late for them to have fun anymore. All the famous people online I loved as a teen are 40 now (AVGN and sWooZie to name a few). Some are dead or dying but really think about it. Living to the average of 75-80 is great for most people. We just stress out too much about the age that we think we're wasting every year away and life seems too short. Well, life does seem short if you're 21, you've only lived 2 decades, you got maybe 50 more decades left at the least. It sounds short but really think of what has happened in the past 10 years. It has been a long time, and the one man who taught me that was my 94-year-old WW2 vet grandfather before he passed away in his sleep. 94! He was an old man by that point and was so done with life and was at ease with it all. If you lived until you were 94 you'd be thinking ""man life is way too long!"" I bet my money on it!"

She did cheat on her almost-perfect boyfriend Aidan, she was at times self-centered and could've been a better friend at certain times, but isn't that all of us? We sometimes do terrible things that end up hurting the people we love. It's part of life, how someone deals with the consequences is what matters. Reflecting and making sure to never do it again is what matters the most. 

Yes, she cheated on Aidan, but so have other good people. I mean Steve cheated on Miranda, Samantha slept with another man in front of Smith's face, and these are the most loved characters on Sex and the City. So does that make her a terrible person, undeserving of redemption? Besides she got her punishment with Berger. 

We can't always be a good, loving, and perfect friend. I mean can you honestly say you've always been a good friend to all of the friends that you had? I don't think so. So, yes she can sometimes make things about her and get carried (LOL) away, but hey she always tried to be there for her friends when it mattered the most. And if she didn't, her friends weren't afraid to check her and put her in her place. 

My point is that Carrie is a complex character that makes so many complex decisions. She represents most of our flaws, and that's what makes her a powerful protagonist. She through everything grows as a person. Plus, her fashion is beautiful and timeless. LOVE HER!"

roguespectre67,unpopularopinion,1620537656.0,Cryptocurrency is a scam and nobody can convince me otherwise,"Let's examine the premise behind cryptocurrency, shall we? I'm not an expert by any means but I like to think I do my research about things of which I hold strong opinions. Let's use Bitcoin as an example, though it is by no means an outlier. Using a computer program, you direct your computer to run lots and lots of calculations in order to contribute, alongside other people, to the solving of what is essentially a giant math problem, and periodically you and the rest of your compatriots will gain access to a certain amount of Bitcoin, the quantity and/or frequency of which goes down over time as the math problem gets harder and harder to solve. Because decentralized records are kept of how much ""work"" went into the ""mining"" of a given amount of Bitcoin and how often that amount changes hands, transactions are nigh-on impossible to fake and, in theory, are not in any way linked directly to any person in particular, making it a very secure method of payment. Sounds great, right?

However, the biggest argument in favor of cryptocurrency is its supposed inherent value that is derived from the amount of ""work"" (i.e., time and/or energy needed by the algorithm) that is required to generate it, a figure which, as mentioned, is verifiable and nearly impossible to fake. This is opposed to what is known as ""fiat money"", or money that is backed not by gold or another commodity, but by the word of whatever state minted it that their currency has, and will continue to hold, value, and can be exchanged for goods and services. After all, what is God to a nonbeliever?

This doesn't seem like a difficult concept to grasp, were it not for the simple fact that when you boil it down, *every* cryptocurrency is traded using a ""real"" currency as an intermediary. Tesla accepts Bitcoin as payment for their vehicles. How much? However much Bitcoin currently equals the dollar value of the car you're trying to buy, which is a variable figure. Bitcoin used to be super cheap when it first began. Why? Because it could be mined on cheap hardware using so little power that its impact on your power bill was negligible. Now, there are *huge* GPU farms drawing enormous amounts of power devoted solely to mining Bitcoin, because it's gotten so hard to generate more of that you need to spend obscene amounts of money to get any of it, either by buying it directly off the market, or by investing in the infrastructure needed to generate it.

And this brings me to the crux of my argument-cryptocurrency is, fundamentally, nothing more than an extremely volatile stock ticker that people use to separate stooges from their money. Outside of the black market and a couple random meme-loving businesses like Tesla that use their acceptance of Bitcoin or another CC as a marketing point because they're desperate to maintain relevance, it can't be exchanged for goods or services anywhere, any more than shares of Gamestop can be used to order things from Amazon or barrels of oil can be used to buy groceries. Exactly like a stock ticker, someone is always-*always*-left holding the bag eventually. Because of that, they are essentially worthless, and anyone who tells you differently is probably trying to sell you theirs."

Man is certainly an extremely talented Chef, no doubt there - but the way people make excuses for his extreme anger issues and lack of people skills is truly baffling. 

The majority of first world countries have literally banned Drill Sergeants from being as brutal as Ramsey is on a regular basis. (That’s not an exaggeration, fact check me). 

I was watching a video recently where he become became red in the face, screaming as loud as he could to someone that they were worthless and an embarrassment to everyone because they were too slow prepping a salad. Same treatment to a man who asked him to stop insulting him. 

Chefs do not act this way. Line cooks do not act this way. I’ve been around them. They do get passionate, yes, and they do debate - but this is not stuff that normal human beings do. Any job in literally any other field would immediately fire you for his behavior.

Another one was a case where a woman on the verge of tears begged him for reduced hours after a 17 hour shift and he just accused her of “making a scene” and trying to be a badass and just gaslit the hell out of her.

There are plenty of people who just don’t have a good time and this way of thinking can make them feel really down about it and like they are the odd one out. Who you end up living with is chance and you may be living with people who you just don’t get on with or gel with.

Also in terms of social life there is an unbelievable emphasis on drinking (at least in the UK), drinking games, going out clubbing. There is real peer pressure to drink beyond your limits and this is so harmful. When people go to uni they are often very young 18/19 years, they want to fit in and make friends and can be easily influenced to go beyond their limits.

All this can really unsettle people and there is a huge problem with loneliness and mental health issues among students, which is also likely due to exam stress etc.. also many people who would likely do much better going straight into work/other training feel they have to go to uni ‘for the experience’

For me uni was ok but far from the best years of my life and plenty people I know had a rubbish time. We need to start setting realistic expectations about it."

(This does NOT equate to how successful or unsuccessful the child(ren) turn out.) So many people who don’t understand children’s age appropriate behaviors don’t know how to properly/appropriate deal with children. So many parents who lack knowledge on childcare and child development constantly misinterpret children’s everyday behaviors or actions and just assume the worse (again, unintentionally harming their children). Many people have children without understanding what it actually entails and end up resenting their children or their position in life. Just because you aren’t the worse parent doesn’t mean you are good at being a parent!"

I didn’t find it unlistenable but I didn’t see the hype in the slightest. 
tbh it deterred me from diving into the rest of his discography for a bit, then I listened to Dirty Mind” which I thought was bit better finally I got to his self titled and its very quickly becoming one of my favorite records. I’ll probably give Purple Rain a few more spins to see if it clicks and it’s definitely not a terrible album but it genuinely stopped me from checking out the rest of his Discography."

Addiction and many others could be seen in the same light if looking for long-term humane outcomes for the majority, rather than short term solutions that only benefit the individual. Full disclosure: I have a condition that is genetic and awful and therefore will either adopt or have no kids, as to do so creates a slim chance that child will suffer from same disease. I dont want to cause suffering or propagate those genes further. I feel this is a responsible move that puts the species before my personal wants."

FushaBlue,unpopularopinion,1620576173.0,People only dislike things because they don't understand them,"Obviously not the case with things that are blatantly horrible, cruel, and hateful.

I've been trying to open my mind to new things, new hobbies, new interests, and new ideas of the world. What I've found is the things I hated most where the ones that I knew nothing about.

As a light example, I've 'hated' skateboarding and skateboarders. Not for any real reason, but in my mind I vilified skateboarding because it was something I never learned to do. In my mind I classified all skateboarders as different from me, the enemy. Now that I've actually tried it and am learning how to skateboard, I've realized that there was no reason for me to dislike it at all. I hated it because I didn't understand it. I hated it because I couldn't accept myself as being 'bad' at something new. 

People have the tendency to hate things that make them feel stupid. That's the worst things about humans, we're so afraid to even consider that we don't understand things or that we're not good at doing something. We've become so egotistical by believing we know everything that we shut down and decide to stop learning anything new. 

I've been spending my entire life trying to become an 'adult'. The more time I spend learning and observing the more I have noticed adults have very little to no behavioral distinctions from children. Children have intellectual curiosity, asking questions and thinking of different answers. Adults prefer to think they know. Adults pretend to understand. Instead of becoming an adult, I decide to be a child who never stops growing and learning, despite age.

We're so afraid to ask questions that might make us look dumb to others that we learn to stop asking questions. We learn to stop questioning our beliefs. We learn to stop questioning who we are, and that often leads us to a state of discontent for ourselves and who we are. If we all just opened up a little bit, thought positively, and tried to understand new ideas I know there's no limit to what we could do.

We hate the things we don't understand, love the things we understand, and punish others for not understanding the things we understand without trying to help them understand."
LetsCrashThisParadeX,unpopularopinion,1620648779.0,The Saw Movies Aren't That Violent (Especially the first couple) and Are Actually Very Cleverly Written and Well Crafted!,"Hey-yo, are you a fan of the Saw films? I feel like they're looked down upon for being dumb or too violent but personally I think that they're really underrated. The first couple aren't THAT violent either and focus way more on the mystery element and play out more like a thriller than a horror, and the further sequels get super wrapped up in plot - Yes the traps become the centrepieces but I don't think the films overall get enough credit for everything else that's going on around them. They're mostly really well crafted investigative type movies that somehow keep surprising you freakin' 7 sequels in! Clearly I wasn't the only one that enjoyed them judging off the crazy amounts of money they made throughout the 2000s but even still I believe they're hugely underrated. Now, I'm not saying you can't pick them apart in certain ways and they're definitely a bit silly and trashy too - but I think they're well written enough to justify their existence and I enjoy every single one of them. The original is the best, saw is the worst and all the others are... Pretty great. 

Anyone else have favourites? Or do you just hate them all? (And if so why? Because there's two sides to that I think: there's the people who think they're too violent and don't know much about them. And there's the people who look down upon them as being stupid and convoluted, which in some ways is fair criticism I won't lie hahaha)

jxcartier,unpopularopinion,1620490265.0,It's not smart to ask for a higher salary just based on length of employment,"There are lots of people who are underpaid, and I think you don't need to tolerate that. However, if you are paid fairly, at more or less average market value, it does not make sense to request a higher salary just because you have been with the company for a long time. Faithfulness to a company is certainly appreciated by any employer, but that alone is not making the company as a whole more profitable. Your pitch for a new salary needs to be based on your own performance and how well you are making a difference for the financial viability of the company.  This opinion needs to be agreed to by the one giving you the salary. If you give the employer an ultimatum and they are forced to give it to you to keep you there, you're putting yourself into hot water that you don't need to be in.

In fact, if your manager is treating you unfairly, and making it impossible for you to contribute any more than you do, you should not ask for a higher salary even then. It's unrelated. The better thing is to get out so that you can give that higher contribution to your next employer's bottom line. At that point, a higher salary is an organic outcome, and one that nobody has to question."

PsychoBalloons,unpopularopinion,1620525815.0,Video Games Themselves Can Cause Aggressive Behavior Amongst Individual Players,"I believe that video games can lead to violent behavior; however, I do not believe VIOLENT video games lead to violent behavior, but rather NINTENDO games cause violence.

Think about it - you always see violent games in the news being blamed for shootings and what not and how there are countless studies proving there is no link between violent games and actual violent tendencies, but no one ever takes a look at Nintendo games and wonders if they are the ones responsible for violent behavior.

&#x200B;

Take for example internet user putz12.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwi0HVNr7AM) is a link to just ONE video of him raging over Splatoon 2 - a game where there is pretty much no violent content whatsoever. This ONE video is over half an hour and he is screaming curses and threats the whole time and there are HOURS of him doing this over the same game. Additionally,  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48_OPuf10kc) is the SIXTH video in a series about speedrunners for Super Mario Sunshine just getting angry from menial stuff. These are just some examples of how violent some people who play Nintendo games can be.

&#x200B;

Lastly, though not explicitly violent, we cannot rule out the recent allegations brought up in the Smash community regarding sexual assault. I believe that over 100 players in the Smash community were called out for sexual assault([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/hjfv0y/summary_of_sexual_and_nonsexual_allegations/)). For other esports, you may have teams where everyone playing is on their own team and are around the same age so you don't have much to worry about, but for Smash brothers, a game largely played in 1v1 format, there is a big age difference amongst players. There are a lot of younger players who just started playing Smash Bros when it released on Switch and there are alot of players who have been playing since Melee and they are usually both present at Smash tournaments. This could be one of the reasons Nintendo does not support tournaments other than their own- they don't want 30+ year old adults mingling with their younger demographic simply because they are worried about how they will interact with each other.

HopnDude,unpopularopinion,1620499727.0,"As someone who grooms their lawn, I'd have to say 2"" makes more of a difference than you know.","19"" to 21"" with a push mower, is a larger difference than people will lead you to believe.

I've had repeated issues with my first gen style electric mower with a 19"" deck. I kept fixing the battery packs but got tired of doing it every year fixing one of the two and fixing the other the next year. The battery didn't deliver enough to give the electric mower much torque plus the motor style not really meant for a thick full lawn.

So I splurged this year and got a Ryobi mower that uses two batteries and can switch between them, plus a rapid charger, all with a 21"" deck. The mower has a 5 year warranty and the batteries have a 3 year warranty. Plus my Ryobi leaf vacuum/mulcher has the same stile battery pack and charger so this helps having a cross compatible ecosystem.

I've only had it a few months now, and my overlapping cross cuts no longer look like pin stripes and now actually look like a more professional cut. Plus the dual blade configuration helps mulch up grass clippings so I don't get clumps of grass in the lawn.

The difference a 2"" larger deck makes is really crazy, and even cut down on my time spent cutting grass, some people just don't care and buy whatever they can. However, I'd argue a larger deck will always result in a better looking cross cut and save you time spent on trimming your lawn.


For those of you with your heads in the gutter, take a cold shower.

EDIT: for those who think it's a penis size reference.
https://imgur.com/gallery/ry6u47L

Honestly, if you have to choose when buying a mower, push or ride type, go with the larger deck for the type you're getting. It'll save you so much time in the long run. Also, the newer electric motors have way more torque than the older ones."

Avyern1,unpopularopinion,1620442785.0,Alien (1972) is a really bad movie,"I can’t think of a single good scene in this movie. The suspense felt rather bland and expected, none of the characters felt powerful, with the strongest being the main character for the next few movies. It didn’t develop anything to make it feel like it’s own movie, it just felt like a really long set up scene for the next movies. The cinematography was good, and lighting helped the scenes feel less bland, but it still doesn’t fix the bad movie flow. If we’re going for complements, I’d say the alien looked great and the acting was rather good for the time, but aside from that I don’t see why it has such a cult following and 5 more movies were made about it. I’m just convinced that the following is solely from nostalgia rather than the actual entertainment value of the movie

All we learn is “strong alien thing is wanted by some space people because some reasons we’ll tell you about in the next movies” like why should I care about this? We only have two characters left who aren’t that interesting, (the cat is the most interesting honestly, he’s gotta be some robot alien cat thing with the amount of people he got killed in the movie.)

gmpklled,unpopularopinion,1620615687.0,Old people who stay in the cities are incredibly selfish,"Have been thinking about my own eventual retirement and realized that there really should be no reason for someone to stay in an urban/suburban center past the retirement age.

First of all, from a personal perspective, an old person is extremely vulnerable and not self-sustainable in a city, requiring way more attention from their family. Whether that's driving in a busy traffic, walking around and crossing busy streets, protecting them from more prevalent urban crime, or supporting them financially in a more expensive city environment. A cabin with a garden and a small town store is a much better setup.

Second, if they get sick, the medical help is readily available, pretty much obligating their family to get them that help, even if that means getting deeply in debt or taking care of a family member who is barely alive (things like strokes etc.) for a very long period. Personally, I would much rather prefer to be in a cabin in the woods, so that when my time comes - it comes. My family can collect the body and grief properly later.

Finally, from a society perspective, old people occupying prime real estate for decades until their death, while they are shut inside, drives up the prices and squeezes out young families who could actually make use of the neighborhood and jobs. San Francisco has entire neighborhoods where there is nothing but million dollar homes and old people, and they're not even rich old people, they just bought their house in 1965 and can barely afford to maintain it now. Coronavirus is another example, where young people had to stay in their tiny city apartments and lose their jobs, because grandma needs to shuffle once a week from her 19th century McMansion to the grocery store. This is a city, it's supposed to be overcrowded and dirty and full of viruses, that's where life happens."

What I am saying is, instead of proxying our sense making to questionable sources, we should try to make sense of matters through questioning the source material. People don't want to put in the work to  understand the science they defend with a religious fervor even in layman's terms. 
 
How far removed is this source of information from the empirical study? Who funded the study? What other endeavors does the funding agency partake in? Are there any other reputable sources with conflicting information that have been buried by a narrative?

I am not talking about questioning the fields of study, I am talking about practicing good epistemology and better judging the purity of the information we receive, and share.

In my country (US), a trip to the grocery store, visiting relatives, picking up the kids or going to a friends is literally one of the most dangerous things you can do. More dangerous than wild animal attacks, getting shot or getting physically attacked in public. 

Adding a substance that greatly hinders ones motor function and cognitive abilities makes the situation worse.

I do think someone’s life should be greatly impacted by just a single DUI. I am not talking about a $2,000 fine and a week in jail. 

I am talking about a year behind bars, several thousands more dollars in fines along with the inability to get a license up to a year after release... *minimum.*


I view driving drunk the same as a person closing their eyes  and indiscriminately firing a gun in every direction. They may not hit someone, they may just graze someone or they may kill someone. They may have not meant to but their actions were stupid & had a blatant disregard for human life. The same with drunk driving."

I think if there was a closed species or a single OC and people were able to purchase that adoptable thru the NFT would be a great way to show ownership of the adoptable in a more official and digital way rather than word of mouth.

The Arrowverse as a whole is good

I am only going to talk about Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, Legends, and Batwoman. Not superman and lois, stargirl, or black lightning. These shows havent finished a full season yet/I havent seen enough of it to judge.

Arrow: Great; S1, S2, S5, First Half of S7, S8
Okay; First Half of S3, Most of S6, Most of the latter half of s7 
Bad; Most of S4, 2nd half of s3(some was good), Rest of S7


Flash: 
Great; S1, S2, First half of S6 
Okay; Half of S3, Half[or more imo] of S4, Rest of S6, Some of S5
Bad; Rest ot S3, Some of S4[ or not imo], Some of S5

Supergirl: 
Great; S4, Some of S3 
Okay; S3, S5, Some of S1&S2 
Bad; The rest of S1&S2


Legends: 
Great; S2, S3, First half of S4, first half of S5 
Okay; S1, Rest of S5 
Bad; Second Half of S4

Batwoman: 
Okay; S1

All in all: 
Great; 11.25 
Okay; ~6-8.5 
Bad; 4.75-5

Some of these are different in your opinion, but this is my opinion mixed in with the genral consensus on the shows. When the Arrowverse is goodz it is amazing. When it is bad, it can be disheartening and painful to watch. Give it shot, or if you stopped watching, use this as a guide to help you choose what to watch. 

People just crap on it because of how bad some of the worser parts are, but overall it is a great Tv Connected Universe and, imo better than any DCEU constructions so far. But we still have time for them to catch up to 8-10 years of Tv.

Even the bad seasons have some golden gems

All I see is people on reddit and other places talking about how removing benches and stuff is a good thing because it keeps homeless people out of their lives. Most people especially in America treat homeless people like they are sub human and try to avoid them in anyway they can. I believe it's because they feel guilty and ashamed that homeless people exist but don't actually feel bad about them. Like not all homeless people are crazy addicts who are going to kill you (some are) just try and say hello and treat them like a fucking person not a burden you have to avoid on the street. As someone who grew up in the poorest US state and lived next to a large homeless camp in LA I've seen real polverty, I can tell you that homeless people are just normal people who need help, dislocating them and pushing them out of public view doesn't fix the problem it just lets people feel better cause they don't have to look at a constant reminder that the perfect world they would like to say they live in doesn't exist. Homeless people shouldn't be relocated because people deserve to feel guilty and ashamed in the system we live in.

Last_Interview_4332,unpopularopinion,1620568791.0,"Scope creep in the gaming industry is ruining games and that's why big developer companies are becoming so greedy; if gamers were less demanding, we might have had a better gaming industry","Companies moving to mobile games with predatory gaming mechanics, $60 games with more pay to win elements etc.

I feel like all of these are due to the massive scope creep in PC/console AAA games. And I feel like this scope creep is hardly contributing anything positive to the gaming industry. If there were no scope creep, developers would have been forced to think creatively and make fun and engaging games. But now they are making unfinished, buggy, cash-grab type games because players just want more graphics and bigger maps.

Some companies like Nintendo, Rockstar have managed to relatively insulate themselves from scope creep by doing new things or selling boatload of a game, but I feel like even big developers like them are not immune of the scope creep problem (the basic problem with scope creep is that it is simply financially less profitable or economically not viable at all) and the symptom that Nintendo is facing scope creep is evident from the fact that they are releasing a single, years old low-effort port for $60 to keep players busy.

Not to mention other developers like CD Projekt, EA, Ubisoft etc.

That's why I feel like indie games are generally more innovative and fun nowadays, but that's a different opinion.

TL;DR: Scope creep is eating the gaming industry alive for most big name developers because of their financial aspects. Until the players change their gameplay habits, we will keep on having buggy, unfinished, cash-grab, pay to win and predatory games"

throwawaythecatplz,unpopularopinion,1620646713.0,China should not have a democracy.,"I’ve lived in China for a long time, and as against the CCP as I am, I don’t think China being a completely democratic society could be stable or solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. Low involvement in politics overall. Maybe the older generation had more opinions, but since the censorship+ unable to express those opinions, younger generations born and raised in China do not have much of a political involvement, other than being taught to support the CCP. Most don’t understand government structures. 

2. History of authoritarian rule. Look at the history, there’s thousands of years where Emperors ruled the country, and instead of ever having a democracy, theyre just replaced by other emperors. While other countries protested for freedom and the right to vote, Chinese people were happy having a non-elected leader because most believe there is more stability this way. 

3. Chinese anti-democracy propaganda means that most Chinese citizens have a strong opinion against the US democracy, believing that it causes chaos. (still, low participation, but strong answering to the propogandas). 

I think older generations were still able to formulate their own opinions. For China right now, people either don’t have other political opinions or they move out of the country. Though I believe a democratic system is superior, I think China could move more towards Singapore’s model where it is essentially authoritarian rule in a democratic framework."

Each person taking this pays upwards of 100 dollars (where im at) to college board, so you think they would at least provide something. Food I can understand not providing as much, but they could at least make the smallest of efforts to do so - either with something like oranges

AP exams aren't *as* bad, but it's still nasty. They turned something that students need into pure profit, a huge amount. 2.2 million students took the SAT last year, and college board just makes out like bandits. 

They even put on pressure for students to sign up for their AP exams. I'm taking mine now, and I had to sign up for it all the way back in the first few months of the school year. 

It's a scummy company that takes advantage of fact SATs are needed and drives up the test price"

Constant-Software999,unpopularopinion,1620582420.0,Nobody should be specifying that they’re being sarcastic at the end of a comment on Reddit.,"I understand that the point of flagging something as sarcastic is to avoid being downvoted to hell, or to avoid a confrontation with someone who thinks they’re serious. My argument is 1. If you’re so shitty at being sarcastic that people can’t tell if your comment is sincere or not, you deserve to be downvoted anyway 2. If a comment is obviously sarcastic, and someone doesn’t have the social skills to recognize it, who cares about their opinion if they try to ostracize you?

Sleep-system,unpopularopinion,1620467251.0,"A lot of men get a bad rap for being selfish lovers, but many women are pretty bad at it, too.","I was having a conversation with a female friend of mine who was saying, quite fairly, that many men don't engage in enough foreplay, aren't attentive or focused enough, and just want to get their orgasm and go. 

I know for a fact there's plenty of truth to that, but on the flip side many of the women I've encountered are also not very good in bed. Many don't have very good tactile awareness; moving too fast, too hard or awkwardly arrhythmic. They're not very attentive when it comes to noticing whether what they're doing is enjoyable or uncomfortable, sometimes downright painful, and it often ends up an exercise in mental endurance waiting for it to be over. 

I'm lucky enough to be with someone now where it feels organic and mutually beneficial, but a lot of that was because of clear conversation and experimentation to figure out what felt the best. It's not up to any one side to bear the sexual responsibility, it's a team sport.

Edit: I've seen a lot of comments upset because I'm conflating selfishness with poor performance. Of course they aren't the same, but they are related. It's hypocritical to say poor performance can always be solved with communication but selfish lovemaking is set in stone. A lot of men don't realize they're selfish lovers because they've never gotten called out for it and assume women do enjoy ""just taking it"", which is part of the porn problem. It's partially your job to check people who have gotten the wrong education when it comes to sex instead of writing them off as fundamentally narcissistic and unable to change. Communication can be tedious but it's necessary."
MassiveAd1221,unpopularopinion,1620435436.0,Brexit is logical and consistent with the UK/Britain’s past foreign policies and actions.,"I’m not here to argue whether Brexit is the right or wrong move for the United Kingdom. I am only arguing that the UK by voting for Brexit is simply being consistent with its foreign policy in Europe dating back 100’s of years. Whether you like or not the European Union is fashioning itself to be a major power in Europe and the world and promotes pan-European ideals and integration. This brings a United Europe closer to fruition than it has possibly ever been before (though if this will ever truly happen is up to debate). The UK has been remarkably consistent in trying to prevent any major power from gaining too much of a foothold on European power. From the Crimean war to WWI and WWII and the Napoleonic wars. Each time the UK has been instrumentalist preventing any European power from gaining too much power in Europe and therefor putting the British isles at risk physically, diplomatically, or economically. Germany in WWI sought to support its allies and gain territory, but in doing so ram the risk of drawing the ire of the world and becoming a superpower in Europe. In support of this goal they allied against Germany, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire to ensure that none of them gained a dominant place in Europe. Similarly the UK fought against Napoleon to stop France from expanding its sphere of influence into all of Europe and putting Britain at risk. Then again when hitler sought to carve up Poland they again supported France, Poland and all of the smaller European countries to keep Europe divided and fighting against itself. Then again in the Cold War the UK stood against the great red menace to prevent all of Europe from falling to the USSR. That brings us to today where through peace and economic cooperation the European Union seeks unification and acts as a confederation (though increasingly as a federation) which is against their historic interest and therefor by going with Brexit they are avoiding the fear whether real or not of a Britain subject to a United European set of ideals. Now that I’ve pissed off everybody go argue to your hearts content! For the record as a non European I am relatively neutral on the Brexit debate so take that as you will."

Amxela,unpopularopinion,1620437086.0,Pepsi Made with Cane Sugar is Worse than Pepsi made with Corn Syrup.,"In the US soft drinks/ soda /pop is always kind of a highly debated subject. From what we call it, to the brand we enjoy more, to what it’s made with. 

A lot of times these soda companies will make a product and then also release the same product but made with can sugar instead of corn syrup as the sweetener. 

When we’re talking Coca-Cola products the cane sugar variant is sometimes referred to as the Mexican kind. So Mexican Coca-Cola, Mexican Sprite, Mexican Fanta, and the likes. I find that these ones usually end up tasting better than their corn syrup counterparts. 

HOWEVER
When we take a look at Pepsi things are a little different. I’ve noticed Pepsi usually releases a cane sugar sweetened Pepsi around summer time and it’s not normally referred to as a Mexican variant. 

This cane sugar variant is also vastly inferior. I’m not sure if they change the flavor when they use cane sugar or what happens but it tastes waaaay worse than Pepsi sweetened with corn syrup.  
Pepsi sweetened with corn syrup often feels more refreshing and doesn’t leave a residue feeling in the back of your throat and on your teeth like the cane sugar one does. 

I’m not sure what Coke does right to make their cane sugar drinks the better variant but Pepsi is definitely not doing it right. 

My rule of thumb: Coke for cane sugar, Pepsi for corn!

K9DOBERMANN,unpopularopinion,1620605950.0,The theatrical ending to Little Shop Of Horrors (1986) fits the tone of the film more than the directors cut,"I’m sure anyone who knows about Little Shop also knows about the two different endings. There’s always been a debate on what ending is better: the one where the plant eats the main characters and wins, or when the main characters survive and the plant is destroyed. In my opinion (which hardly anyone seems to realise) is the happy ending suits the film version, while the dark ending suits the stage play.
In the stage play, the characters are horrible and selfish. Seymour willingly kills two people to gain success, resulting in Audrey being killed and later himself. The message here is “don’t make a deal with the devil and expect him not to collect”.
In the film however, the characters, particularly Seymour and Audrey, are much nicer people. Seymour doesn’t technically kill anyone here, he just gets roped into things like being unable to save Orin from suffocating. He even tries warning Mushnik at the near last minute before he is killed by the plant.

While I agree with the moral of the story, it doesn’t apply to the ‘86 film. The theatrical cut works better for the film, but the directors cut could’ve still been used as a dream sequence that makes Seymour realise he had to destroy the plant and could be used as maybe a redemption arc.

Yeah I don’t have a life. How could you tell?"

It's unsafe for animals living in this ecosystem as cats kill them for fun and they have their food at home. It's also unsafe for the cat because there are countless of dangers outside, such as cars, people in general and other predators depending on where you live.

Dascoolman,unpopularopinion,1620633054.0,Golden Oreos are just better than the originals (also all cookies and cream stuff is better than original oreos),"I'm sorry but dang I really dislike regular oreos. Do they make me gag? No, would I be unable to finish a few? No, but my lord are they always a disappointment. When ever I crave an oreo my head immediately goes to the flavor of cookies and cream stuff. Either cookies and cream ice cream or the cookies and cream Hershey bar which all slap so hard. So of course my dumb hungry self is gonna want some oreos during a long lecture or road trip. But every time I have a regular oreo it's either the cookie doesn't taste much like chocolate or the cream doesn't taste like vanilla (which I'm sure it's not supposed to, but man has stuff made me think it's supposed to be this beautiful chocolate vinilla mix) and the whole thing tastes kinda bland. It just tastes sweet.

Where as vanilla oreos have a freaking flavor. The cookie tastes like vanilla, and I love vanilla! It's not an exceptional vanilla but when I've been in a car for 4 hours craving some sort of joy it works. I don't even feel like oreos add much to stuff, like those slutty brownies I feel like the oreo stands no chance against how flavorful brownies and cookies are. It just gets completely dwarfed and isn't really worth the couple extra calories.

I will say though I do betray vanilla oreos in one respect. Fried oreos make oreos completely edible to me. Maybe it's the fact that the oreo is now this heated up gooey center. That the batter and everything works to enhance the oreo itself. That heating it unlocks the chocolate that lays dormant within the cookie and it being the center of the show let's it pop? Maybe idk, just don't wanna eat them any other way, I'm a golden guy all the way.

LordoFlames,unpopularopinion,1620448655.0,I hope there isn't an afterlife.,"Everything I've heard about afterlife, mostly the belief that you either go to heaven or hell, sounds ridiculous to me. 

For heaven it's an eternal afterlife that's supposed to be all good and joyful, and you get to see all the people you knew who died yatta yatta yatta. But after a while it'd really suck and get boring. Sure you could also devote your eternal afterlife to gaining knowledge and picking up new skills, but what would be the point if you can't use them for anything? 
I've already had a point in my life when I thought life was meaningless, I don't want a meaningless eternal afterlife. 

For Hell it's an eternal damnation to punishment for being a bad person on Earth. What the hell would be the point of that? They did their shit in their life that probably hurt a lot of people. Those people aren't going to suddenly feel happy again or come back to life because Hitler gets a new pen pal in Hell. 

The best form of afterlife, in my opinion, would be Valhalla. Like at least then I died a noble death, get to spend my afterlife learning skills I've wanted to learn IRL, and have a purpose for ""living"" forever as to be a soldier in Ragnarok. This one would still suck because it's mostly just fighting forever until you permanently die in Ragnarok. Fuck that. 

Then reincarnation. Like if I died I'd rather live forever in Heaven than come back to live on Earth again. First of all life on Earth can really suck given the luck involved in where and how you're born. Not to mention no one has ever been reincarnated with the memories (at least not proven I guess) of their past life. So what would be the point of reincarnation if I don't remember who I was? Wouldn't be the same person. And if I did remember my past life it'd suck being a baby again. Although it would be cool for a bit, being the smartest toddler ever, I'd very quickly be sad, as everyone I knew in my life is either dead or at least most likely very far away. And then, assuming I got to live a long life with a loving spouse before dying I can't imagine it being easy to ever fall in love like that again, especially not without feeling guilty about what I did in my past life. 

Tl;Dr 
Death sucks and the afterlife is boring and pointless. I'm not religious, and when I die I hope I fade into nothingness with no consciousness. 

Preemptive RIP to my Karma points most likely."

Another point if a parent murder and or steal to benefit his kids then afterwards he get caught and all the money is confiscated back. the son/daughter are still guilty because they could've been benefited up to that point.

Bravo_McDaniel,unpopularopinion,1620518553.0,"This whole ""LeVar Burton needs to be the next host of Jeopardy!"" circlejerk is really annoying and I bet a vast majority of the people clamoring for him don't even care about the show in the first place.","Ever since Alex Trebek died and Jeopardy! has been going through their rounds of guest hosts, there has been A LOT of fanfare and demand for LeVar Burton to host the show. At first it was fine, but the increasing fervor for him has gotten really annoying.

First of all, how many people begging for Burton to be the host are avid Jeopardy! watchers? You see a lot of these people demanding Burton on reddit, Twitter, and other social media platforms. A majority of those people are going to be young, and younger you get, the less likely you are to watch regular broadcast TV. The ratings have steadily been declining and vast majority of viewers are senior citizens.

Even when Burton guest hosts, I highly doubt these people will tune in for the whole two weeks. But really, why aren't they? With this much demand, the ratings on Burton's episode should shoot through the roof! This is what they wanted, so why aren't they watching all of it? Because they don't actually care. I can see a bump in ratings when he first hosts, but a dip after that, because again, those people didn't care about Jeopardy! in the first place.

Also, the #1 reason those super vocal people want him to host is all because of nostalgia. The only reason people even give somewhat of a shit about him is because he was on some shows when they were kids. ""He was on Reading Rainbow! He spread knowledge when we were kids, and now he can spread it to us as adults!""

That line of thinking is incredibly simplistic and naïve.,""He was on Reading Rainbow! Reading is knowledge, and Jeopardy! is knowledge! It's a perfect fit!"" Umm... so? Trebek wasn't originally chosen as the host because he was known for ""spreading knowledge"" or whatever. It's because he was an established game show host and television personality who was good at his job.

I have no problem at all with LeVar Burton guest hosting Jeopardy! and if he's the best of the lot, then he should get the job. However, these people constantly saying he should be the new host probably don't even watch the show in the first place and only want Burton because of nostalgia and internet bandwagoning."

ashindn1l3,unpopularopinion,1620448740.0,Right to Repair is misunderstood and overhyped,"People seem to automatically assume the Right to Repair will be a good thing for them.

MKBHD recently had a video about how we should take for granted the ability to repair our devices. 

While I believe the simple things like storage, RAM should be easily replaceable, this video was a pretty naive take on how many things can go wrong. I’m sure there are several repair shops that’ll do a great job, but just as many that’ll use crappy parts/take shortcuts, but when things don’t work on your device the way you expect it to, most people will blame the manufacturer. For example, if you get a third party iPhone display replacement and it starts glitching out in a year, it’s very easy to blame iOS, for example. And you might decide never to buy an iOS device again, which would be the wrong outcome for both Apple AND the consumer.

Controlling the experience is an important part of the success of a product, for both customers and companies. 

That said, I wish there was some kind of regulation controlling the cost of repairs, which imo is the best customer-consequence of RTR.

Also, I HATE how poorly designed and lazy the Apple designs have become. It’s not just that third parties can’t repair most things, apple can’t either. They just swap out your phone and “recycle” the product, which also has an environmental cost. I had to replace an entire iPhone because one of the mics stopped working. Repairable and sustainable design is a more important philosophy, in my opinion."

This is really unpopular, but if a friendly, off-leash dog wants to say hi to the aggressive, on-leash dog and gets mauled, I don't think that is the fault of the off-leash dog's owner just because the other dog was ""under control"" while theirs wasn't. 

One dog is chill and well-behaved just wanting to say hi to a new friend, and the other just wants to kill it (at the fault of the owner's lack of training). 

The dog with the aggression issues needs some serious training before it should even be allowed in an area near other people or dogs. Because the sad reality is, a dog that bites is a dead dog."

Elephant- Another animal that is only popular because people think it's trunk and ears make it look '' cool'' .It's the lamest animal ever .

&#x200B;

Gorillas , Chimpanzees , Baboons, Macaques - I think that they are getting too much attention , because of the meme '' Monke "" . They are just plain , ugly animals who like to scream.

&#x200B;

Kangaroos- Idk why everyone is saying they're cute. I find Wallabies 10 times more  as cute . And they are just jumping oversized Rabbits , that aren't even cute

Pandas- colored bears . I do get that they are endangered , but that aside there's nothing cool about them

&#x200B;

Foxes -  They look cool , but i'm sick of them being portrayed as a thief  in my countries  nearly every old story books for children.

&#x200B;

Hamsters- Useless pets , that every 10 year old want's to get . Besides they're not even cute.

&#x200B;

Horses - Nearly  Every teen girls obsession . They're not pretty , they're Gods mistake. 

&#x200B;

Moose- Oversized deer , popular because '' haha Scandinavian moose funny""'.

&#x200B;

Beavers - Looks like God got a bit too drunk.

&#x200B;

Platypus - ""' haha beaver-duck hybrid funny'' .

&#x200B;

Camels - Ugly llamas with 1 or 2 Humps.

&#x200B;

Llamas - Talking about Llamas , they're just 4 legs with a neck and a "" funny face "" . How about we switch to the cute Alpacas ???

Kendradollx,unpopularopinion,1620518113.0,If you buy a dog from a breeder or pet store you shouldn’t be allowed to access low cost vet clinics,"If you can afford a thousand dollar dog, you can afford a private practice clinic.  Low cost clinics are meant for those who need it, not because an owner wants to be cheap.  Low-cost clinics typically work with rescues and organizations around the area to help the overpopulation crisis cities face.  When you bring in your $1,000 pug, you’re taking the appointment slot for a shelter animal needing to be fixed before being available for adoption or a feral cat needed to be TNRd.  Poor people deserve pets and make suitable owners.  

If you can afford coughing up thousands of dollars for a dog, you can afford a full service vet clinic.

Edit: When rich people abuse low cost services, that directly affects poor people and their pets.  This shouldn’t be misinterpreted as anything else other than low income people have resources available, but the opportunities have been stolen by rich people wanting to save 40 dollars."

EliteVoodoo1776,unpopularopinion,1620507745.0,Social Media is a Social Godsend,"Now, before I get a ton of comments saying “this isn’t unpopular”, hear me out. Most of the time when people bring up “social media” as a broad term these days it is almost always negative in the media or in just basic day to day conversation, so yes. It is quite unpopular.

Set aside the fake news, memes, and attention seeking trends and when you boil down social media it’s an incredible tool unlike we have ever had for things like dating new potential partners, finding new potential friends, and getting jobs that we would have never known existed without it.

30 years ago say you’re going on a blind date. You have no idea who the other person is. You just know they are a friend of a friend, and that you know your mutual friend thinks the two of you could be good together. Then the date comes, you meet, and it goes to shit unbelievably fast. Nothing is right. You’re a terrible fit, and you have a bad night. So, now you have 2 options:

- Go on another date and risk it again thinking maybe this was a fluke, and risk having just as bad of a night.

bullshit-name,unpopularopinion,1620516037.0,The “flipping” or reselling of household objects is out of hand and should be discouraged,"I’ve been seeming this be very trendy lately among self-proclaimed entrepreneurs. There numerous accounts on insta/tik tok on “HoW tO mAkE $$ qUiCk” often involving people going to thrift stores and reselling the items they buy. I’ve seen some as well where people go to clearance sales and will scan an item to see how much they can sell it for on Amazon.

For thrift stores especially this is a pretty messed up practice as people are exploiting charities for personal profit. Especially places like the Arc or Goodwill, like there’s a reason everything is so cheap. This is places where people with good intentions donated their things  to a charity that benefits the most vulnerable in the community. 

I respect these people as much as I respect bankers. All they’re really doing is moving around inventory, artificially inflating prices, and contributing nothing to society. 

A perfect example of this is Nike’s new “hands free” shoes originally designed for people with disabilities. However, the vast majority of the inventory has already been bought up by 2nd party sellers. So anyone that actually wants to get these shoes for their original purpose will have to pay $600+ for something that was supposed to increase accessibility.

TL;DT: the flipping of found goods contributes nothing to the world and often exploits charities"

Sodableach,unpopularopinion,1620645109.0,I think it's weird how normalized the daily use of makeup is.,"First of all, I am not against makeup in general. I know for many people it is a way of self expression or even a hobby. Also I am a guy, so maybe there is something to it I don't understand.

That being said, I think the excessive use of makeup is way to common. Shouldn't makeup be something for special occasions? Shouldn't it be used in the context of dressing up? A first date, a wedding, a family dinner. But going to the grocery store with a full face of makeup just seems odd to me. 

In the long run it is altering our perception of the people around us. It's really strange how different someone can look to you without makeup if they had it on nearly every time you saw them. It's not having the effect of impressing people with how good you look, if it's used very rarely anymore, but rather the oposit, making you look like something is off or you are ill, if you don't wear it once after using it daily. And I think that is really sad.

I just think it’s a super messed up system. Businesses should pay their servers more.       
Rude servers would lead to less customers and they would get fired. Good servers would be harder to come by but they would be good and also paid more because they wouldn’t work for cheap while also having to be nice and do a good job.     

Prices of food would rise, or “mandatory tipping” 
But this makes sure that the servers there are getting paid what they think is acceptable or they wouldn’t be working there. Patrons don’t have to guess how much they have to tip and they can avoid all this awkward “moral” decision making. The servers’ wages would not be contingent on how customers are feeling. 

Servers bitch about not getting good tips but they and their bosses love the system the most only they are dishonest about loving it for the potential to earn big tips.

People that leave exorbitant cash tips should probably pay into somethings that gets taxed but that’s a different gripe on its own."

Do expensive jewels belong to governments who don't exist anymore? Their successors? Personally, I don't think it matters. To me, the only important question is whether or not ancient artifacts are being kept safe, looked after, and receiving the attention they deserve on their own merit, not because powerful people somewhere else want to use those historical treasures as a way of propping themselves up politically. In essence, the claims of governments unrelated to the artifacts in question are all equal.

peanuts_and_pigeons,unpopularopinion,1620561245.0,Family-based work experience should matter as much as 'real' work experience in resumes.,"I feel that there is this socially biased stigma against family-based work experience, that it is somehow invalid or inferior to conventional or 'real' work experience. I think that it should at least be considered seriously.

From last year, I had been applying for so many customer and food service jobs, with every single one of them turning me down because there were always 'better applicants', presumably with 'real' work experience. So I was absolutely ecstatic when I was accepted by a chain restaurant in Sydney (peri-chicken. Since then, I've received showers of praise from others and my manager, in which we land on a discussion of how I have improved ""so, so much"" over the four months as she puts it. My co-worker points out that I used to work at my family restaurant, and I agreed.

**My manager says: ""but that doesn't count?""** 

Family-based work experience will differ for many people. I believe part of the stigma derives from the prejudice that people who work for parents just get it easier, get to pass time. But for some people including myself, we are more than just helping hands. Sometimes we take the same initiatives and responsibilities as other co-workers and we really learn how to do stuff at a young age. Even though I didn't have proper pay (my payment was getting to live under a roof), I worked just as attentively for my parents, even more than some of their previous employees. 

Hence, I think people should take family experience more seriously in resumes, especially for customer service, hospitality and retail jobs, where young job seekers don't have any other real experience that they can depend on."
hani-north,unpopularopinion,1620515105.0,Vesectomies should be normalised as a normal and acceptable from of birth control,"Except for condoms, which are not 100% effective, men lack birth control options.

Thus, the burden often fall on women. We are expected to be on the pill or another form of birth control. Birth control can have horrible side effects, such as blood clots and depression, and can be very expensive and difficult to access depending on where you are from. My experience were especially bad, I had my period for 4 months and developed chronic pain.

My main point is, the burden of birth control should not fall on one gender alone.

As of right now men have few options, although I do believe there are people who are working on creating birth control for men.

Nevertheless, I think it should be more normal for men to freeze their sperm and get a vesectomy. By freezing their sperm they can still have kids, and there is no possibility of forgetting to take a pill.

I also think this would give men more control. There are so many instances of men becoming fathers when they don’t want to. This is a constant source of anxiety for my male friends. Instance where women lie about being on birth control would be less of an issue.

Additionally, men by nature have the ability to impregnate more women then women can give birth. A woman can only have about one child a year and the window that women are able to get pregnant are limited. A sexual active man in his physical prime can cause far more unwanted pregnancies that a woman who is not on birth control.

Obviously this option isn’t perfect, but neither is how we currently do things. I would like to emphasise that I am only for voluntary vesectomies, bodily autonomy is very important to uphold.

To summarise my main point, the burden of birth control should not fall one one gender alone.

Edit: maybe “spread awareness and advocate for more options for male birth control” would be a more suitable title."

Furthermore, thought experiments presented in art and science ficition sometimes paint a grim picture of how special a human being's mind might be.  For example, *West World* raises questions about consciousness and identity by presenting an eventual ability to decode and capture a person's personality and resurrect them as a mechanical clone.  This idea suggests that human reasoning and action is nothing more than a flowchart imprinted within our brain that is activated through external stimuli.  The study of lower-level organisms seems to suggest such simplistic neural causation as well.

Nevertheless, new science around the concept of ""attention"" is being ""discovered"" which confirms what ancient spiritual practices have always taught-- that our body is a network of stimuli that can be observed *by ourselves*;  through practicing *awareness* and harnessing *attention*, we can observe a normally unconscious processing of information flowing through our body and dictating our life.  It seems to suggest that free will would not truly exist for a person without the intervention of awareness and attention.  Perhaps a person not practicing awareness would be no different than a robot repreatedly and incessantly following the instructions of its computer-brain as it responds to stimuli.  It definitely makes us wonder whether or not we are truly in control of ourselves.

In a hypothetical lawful universe where there were only robots with instructions \[and no free will\], it would appear that the future would be predictable and deterministic, but are we able to say that that future already exists?  Some theoretical physicists think we live in a ""multiverse"", where many parallel universes may simultaneously exist, including and alongside the one you are currently experiencing.  Some physicists even theorize that universes get created all the time through the collision of universe membranes.  On the other end of the science-spectrum, some people claiming to have various psychic abilities have claimed to be able to see into the past or the future.  It makes us wonder whether we can peer into universes alongside ours which run on different timelines.  Some scientists and laypeople even theorize that when our universe (or accessible collection of universes) burst into existence, its entire timeline was created and we are experiencing the predictable universe and the future that has already been written for us.  However, this notion reeks of Determinism and violates our instincts of having free will.

In the same way that we create and run computer simulations of the possible creation and path of our cosmos, it seems possible that we and our universe is a complex computer program or a beautiful song that was written and then executed or played by some unknown entity.  Then again, we seem to be able to get behind the running projected film of our minds; we seem to be able to intercept our thoughts and manifest a new chosen reality.  Perhaps when we make *aware* choices, we are just choosing to slide into a different parallel universe, for which the entire timeline already exists.  The future is already written, but you can re-write small parts of it (at least from your perspective).

TLDR; we usually aren't as free and aware as we think, but when we are and we make a free choice, we are selecting one of many parallel universes, wherein its entire timeline already exists."

smxlltxwn_,unpopularopinion,1620575327.0,Mother’s Day should only be celebrated by/with active mothers,"Of course this doesn’t apply if you have lost your mother/father, in which I’m so sorry for your loss and I send you all virtual hugs ❤️.

But mothers who have chosen to not be active in their child’s life should not expect a Happy Mother’s Day and or gift. Especially those who have abandoned/estranged/abused their own kids. 

If you actively chose to not be engaged with your children, you should not expect anything on Mother’s Day that you have not earned. 

The same thing of course applies to Father’s Day. It’s really sad and disgusting to see an inactive or estranged parent expect celebration when they have not earned even the title of mom or dad. Imagine demanding a full day of respect when you can’t even show any respect to your children or other partner. Imagine only being a parent to receive praise. It’s really gross.

The only time this doesn’t apply is once again if you have lost a parent, or you are separated but they’re still at least trying to be active in your life. Active, helpful, nurturing parents definitely deserve the celebration. 

Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers who have truly, fully invested in their children without expecting praise. Being a parent is a full time job, and if you are committed to that job, I hope you have an amazing day!

Please feel free to comment what you think! I’d love to hear from anyone. 

Edit: Please feel free to celebrate today however you feel like it! I’m celebrating my stepmom today, but celebrate whoever you would like, or don’t celebrate! It’s always up to your surroundings and how you feel about today."

Disability, scarring (such as burns ect.) or mental/physical illness is not factored in as this is uncontrollable and circumstantial. 

But if you’re dressed in your full tracksuit with a hood over your headon and a bum-bag in broad daylight, I’m gonna assume you’re compensating or a thief.

If you’re not wearing shoes and are wearing grotty clothes in a public space I’m gonna assume you’re a grub (I understand there could be reasoning for this such as homelessness/poverty).

If you’re wearing really fancy attire and all pimped up when there is no need to and you’re literally just shopping or eating lunch, I’m gonna assume you’re a pratt and probably think too highly of yourself.

So you get my point. To add further context, I am not a rude person, I just think people should understand that their gonna be judged based on how they present themselves, and if they have a problem with it then it isn’t my fault. Presentation says a lot, and if you’re going to attack me for judging you based on how you have presented yourself to me, well you’re either to blind to see yourself or you’re looking for attention."

It's almost like a cult or a religion at this point. It's infuriating trying to argue with people, they can't just admit they don't have a point to make and they don't have an argument. Nobody can admit they may be wrong anymore, nobody can concede. An argument must be won at all cost. 

Why should female sports leagues be funded at the same level as men? Nobody can tell me aside from ""I think so"" or call me slurs. 

If they bring in the same crowds, generate the same revenue, and put on a level of athleticism and physical performance that is as entertaining to watch, then sure fund equally. But they don't, it's a failure on all three levels. Why should somebody get the same amount of money for sub par results? That makes no sense at all... I'm in no way saying don't fund it, I'm just saying not at the same level because that's literally unfair to those who actually earn that revenue.

Okay so this might not seem like a huge deal to most of you here either way, but lately as I’m sure you’ve heard, there’s been more brutal conflicts in the Israel-Palestine region going on the past few days with protestors being injured (not here to talk about the conflict itself). Some friends I know changed their profile pics on Instagram to show support for the Palestinian cause (a red background with anything related to the Free Palestine slogan), and even though I raised awareness on it on social media, I didn’t change my profile pic (I like the one of myself). 

Few hours later, these same friends are on my head asking me why I haven’t changed my profile pic yet since I clearly saw they did. Well, you do realize you don’t have to support a cause by changing a picture? There’s plenty of other ways to, and in addition even if I didn’t support the cause in ANY WAY at all, there’s still no reason to get on someone for not doing that. 

Tl;dr, don’t get on others’ case for not showing on social media in some way that they are in support or raising awareness of a cause in the world.

Any system where one person, or a small group of people, control the resource allocation for a much larger group, is *an authoritarian mode of distributing resources*.

I think that it flies in the face of our understanding of so-called ""democracies"" since the places people spend by far the most time in these societies is at work, labouring under these hierarchical authoritarian business structures.

What I observe is that we're led to believe that workplace democracy doesn't really ""count"" — that its not worth including in our analysis of what a healthy democracy should look like, so people ignore it.

Like what fucking predator falls for this shit? There literally hundreds of videos on the internet about catching pedophiles not to mention that they have millions of views, and their methods of trying to catch them are almost all the same (just say in your bio that you are fucking 13 years old and then boom you're done, you already attracted a bunch of basement-dwelling pedos in the same way a light-bulb attracts a bunch of disgusting flies).

How the hell do they not think about the possiblity of the person they are talking to being a fake decoy meant to bait and catch them? Don't they think about the possiblity of their conversations being screen-shotted? And most of these conversations feel so forced, straightforward, and blunt.

2) They make me feel like I'm either in a motherfucking dump or an abandoned house: when I lay down on my bed and see a bug walking right next to my head, when there's a cobweb with a bunch of bugs stuck to it in a corner, when there's a silverfish or a roach crawling on the floor or wall, when there are flies or mosquitoes circling around me, when there's a spider hanging from the ceiling, when a bug is eating your food, etc etc etc, those are all fucking disgusting moments

3) They spread diseases

4) They lay their eggs around your house and then there's more and more of them

If you have mold growing on your things, everyone's gonna say you need help, but for some reason, having living creatures crawling around is ok? I think both of those things belong in a dump, not anyone's home. I have a net behind my window so nothing can fly in and also I throw ALL bugs I see outside immediately. I don't get how some people are ok with just letting bugs chill in their homes"

This has been a trend for years now.  However, I am in favor of walls. My house has an open concept first floor (was like this when we bought it) and I can't stand having to hear the sound of someone washing dishes, or the microwave humming, etc when I'm in the living room area trying to watch TV.

MsilCmd,unpopularopinion,1620539564.0,Corporate employees are mediocre at their profession and should stop vying to be top mediocre dog,"People take jobs at corporations, because they are mediocre at their profession, and they know it. They want a safe and mediocre job. That includes the executives. Exceptional people tend to found and/or run their own businesses, or work on a consulting basis for being the best in their field.

So, why do so many of these unexceptional people spend so much time vying for power scraps at what is by nature a career shelter for the mediocre? Why stress and scheme so much? For 2 or 3% more in an annual raise? So that 25 years later you can finally afford that convertible Ferrari, and drive it along the beach with no hair left on your head, a walker in the back from a bad hip and back, high BP meds in the glove box, and all of the young people you pass laughing at you because you look like a burned out middle age tool bag? 

All of the power and applause seeking just stresses you and everyone around you the fuck out, and never accomplishes anything that is more than mediocre. Work your 8 hours, doing the best job your mediocre ass can, get your paycheck, then go the fuck home. Spend that extra energy doing healthy shit with your life instead.

edit: to clear things up for the buttburt and illiterate, I did not say choosing a job for the mediocre is a bad thing. It's a perfectly good career path for a mediocre professional, and will pay the bills, and possibly be somewhat rewarding. The point here is clear in saying that the problem is people who scrape and claw and stress to try to be the top dog of the mediocre, stressing out everyone around them. If you're mediocre and chose the path of career mediocrity there's no point making it stressful, because being the top dog of the mediocre doesn't mean shit to anyone anywhere."
leekjuicewiththepulp,unpopularopinion,1620576090.0,There is nothing wrong with letting children see a non-pornographic sex scene in a film.,"To clarify: I don’t mean a brutal rape scene - or a rape scene of any kind, I don’t mean porn, I don’t mean some kinky whatever. I mean a plain vanilla, consensual & loving, non-super explicit sex scene (by ‘super explicit’ I mean things like the amount of screen time genitalia gets basically starts bordering on porn). I say this based off my own personal experience; growing up, my parents never covered my eyes or ears with these things. Mind you, I was “allowed” to watch that sort of thing probably when I got into the double digits, ~ten years old and up. Before that, if I would happen to walk into the room when a sex scene was showing, nobody would get up and scramble to shield my eyes, but they would casually pause the movie. Like I said, that stopped as I got a little older. Kids don’t need to be introduced to the concept of sex right out the gate, but I don’t think the “double digits” are an unreasonable time to start with that or expect that they would begin to be in the know. It’s better that the child ask any questions they might have of their parents, rather than Billy, who is just as un-knowledgeable and probably making up information on the fly because he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, in the school yard. It’s odd to me that scenes depicting violence are considered More socially acceptable to show children rather than a normal, natural, loving process. Both are fine to show, just not in the heavy-hitting ways."

mortismetal,unpopularopinion,1620540329.0,The Witcher 3 is severely overrated...,"Now if you enjoyed the game, good for you. Its decently polished, and I did enjoy it initially.

After reading the hype on reddit about this game, I decided to pick it up. I've played a significant amount of the story, right up to setting sail to Skellige. I played a lot of the side missions. 

The voice acting is so boring, I read the subtitles and skip the speaking bits. The UI system is awful. A lot of games keep text entries in a single area. The fact I have to check my inventory for relevant documents instead of the section that so obviously can be used for documents is a gross oversight IMO. The fact you can only apply upgrades (sigils n stuff) to weapons only when they are equipped to Geralt is another frustrating oversight. 

I have a massive gripe with how the XP system works in this game. Walking around the game world, you constantly come across monsters that you have to kill or risk dying. No XP awarded for the risk taken, just stuff for potions. Any engagement with world mobs feels like a chore.

The weapon degradation system is also frustrating. Having to constantly monitor how far off your weapon is from losing prime effectiveness detracts from my experience. The variety of weapons available is also a little disappointing. Spears? No. Halberds? Nada. Daggers? Ha NO. 

 Swords, axes, and maces. And a tiny crossbow. No shields.

The fighting, which was the most fun part of the game for me, was button mashing. I experienced more interesting combat from the Batman: Arkham series.

The story sometimes is unclear, unless you've played earlier games. So, maybe a longer introduction would have been nice? 

Fast travel is only from specific signposts. Thats fine, if the traversal doesnt feel like a chore - which it does to me. Other games that did this were Far Cry 3, Cyberpunk (I think), MGSV and the Arkham series. Except, I didnt mind running around in these worlds to look for clues and enjoy the experience...

Thats about it for my critques.

Positives:

The jokes are funny at times. Roach is a good horse. Food looks tasty. Enemy designs are gorgeous. 

6/10 for me."

amonrane,unpopularopinion,1620499266.0,Parents should not force their children to go on amusement park rides that they don't want to go on.,"I was on line for a ride at a theme park.  The ride wasn't what I would consider a super intense or scary ride.  Kind of a mild indoor roller coaster.  As we were getting on I see/hear a kid who was maybe 9 or 10 crying and yelling repeatedly ""I don't want to go on this.""  And his parents just ignored him and made him go on it.  Other people were looking at them, but nobody said anything and the ride operator just let the parents drag this clearly terrified kid on the ride.  I was like are they really going to make this kid go on this ride.  And, yeah, they did.

I know some people are okay with making kids go on rides they don't want to go on.  I guess the thinking is that they know it won't hurt the child, it helps them build confidence/overcome fears, and they think the child will like it once they do it.  Or maybe it's just selfishness because they want to go on the ride and can't leave Timmy by himself, so Timmy is going whether he likes it or not.  Either way I think it's messed up, bad parenting, and probably does more harm than good to the child.  There are better ways to help your child build confidence and overcome their fears.  And ride operators should be instructed to not allow any person on a ride who clearly doesn't want to go on it, regardless of their age.

EDIT: Just to clarify, it appeared that the kid got ""cold feet"" and  panicked at the last minute before boarding the ride.  I don't think the parents expected him to react that way.  We were near them in line and I didn't even notice them until the kid started crying and saying he didn't want to go on once we got close to getting on the ride.  The parents were just kind of laughing it off saying ""oh come on, it's not even a scary ride"" and ""you'll be fine"".  They were probably a little embarrassed themselves.  But I still think they made the wrong decision making him go on the ride.  When you see a kid go into full panic mode like that, you feel bad for him.  I think they should have just taken him off the ride."

It ruins relationships and marriages, it's constantly used as an excuse for bad behaviour, ""oh my spouse wasn't having enough sex with me so I cheated because I NEED it."" There's an uncomfortably large population of people who think cheating is perfectly acceptable because sex is just ""that important"" and ""there was no alternative."" That perfect balance of perfect sexual compatibility is almost impossible to find and it's what everyone looks for first and foremost, then they end up basing their entire marriage on sex, then are surprised when they're getting divorced 10 years later because something about that compatibility changed. People send unsolicited nudes thinking that'll help them get it, they say incredibly inappropriate things to each other thinking that'll help them get it, they'll cheat to get it, they'll rape to get it, they place all of they faith they have in the world in it, and are willing to stoop to incredible lows to get it. People will base their entire existence on it, they'll get it from any stranger they can and risk STD's, accidental pregnancy, rape, and murder for an hour of feeling good, and think a condom will protect them 100% from all of that, and claim that's a ""healthy"" way to live. It can result in a very serious addiction. Without sex, there would be no abortion, of which hundreds of thousands happen per year. Children have been victimized by it, animals have been victimized by it, people have been beaten over it, and people have been murdered over it. Foster homes are overflowing because of it, and many parts of the world are overpopulated because of it.

I think a good scary game must make the player feel they're not in control, not just regarding the game itself but also on a psychological level. First make them think they already ""understood"" the game, only to then turn around and show they don't really know anything."

PyroAmos,unpopularopinion,1620585224.0,'You deserve better' is heavily over-used and often bad advice.,"I see all the time on here, someone tells a story and someone tells them 'you deserve better'.... you don't know that. You've heard one side of one story. Relationships (both romantic, familial and platonic) are complex, disagreements happen, regrettable things get said that can't get taken back... these are things that should be worked through in otherwise healthy relationships, not ran away from. Hearing one side of one story from a stranger isn't close to enough to determine anything, and having someone say 'you deserve better' can often be the excuse people are looking for to run away from an otherwise healthy relationship, rather than do the hard part of relationships and work through their disagreement. Maybe they're the toxic person and the story is a build up over time, and instead of fixing the relationship and working on themselves, you just told them it's ok to be toxic, ditch them and go be toxic to someone else until they break.

TLDR; Albeit sometimes it's true, throwing it out as a knee-jerk reaction to a stranger's story, when you don't know anything about the rest of the history and context of their relationship, is more destructive than helpful."

butthairmilk,unpopularopinion,1620627773.0,The chicken came first.,"Most people think the egg came first.

 If you google the question, you'll find most articles claim to have solved the answer using science. The wikipedia article on the ancient paradox resolves the question from a biological standpoint by saying the line that defines what a chicken is isn't as clearly defined as we'd like, therefore a ""proto chicken"" with chicken mutations laid the egg that became a chicken - still reinforcing the the idea both from a taxonomical standpoint as well as a genetic one. It even has references to Niel Degrasse Tyson, who summarizes the resolution by answering with ""The egg—laid by a bird that was not a chicken"". You can read the article yourself if you wanna but there's no point.All of that is bullshit. 

The chicken came first.

The answer lies with semantics and one obvious assumption: the egg is a *chicken's* egg. The question, ""which came first, the chicken or the egg?"" has no implicit reference to who owns the egg. We can safely assume the question refers to a chicken's egg because the only other options are an egg in general, or more specifically a *non*-chicken egg. In either case, the egg would have come first. Evolutionarily speaking, they did. Eggs have hundreds of millions of years on chicken's. 

The question therefore has to be refering to specifically a chicken's egg. We can ask the question 'what lays chicken eggs?' but the answer is a moot point because the question is not about what lays chicken eggs; it's about who does the egg belong to: the animal (chicken/protochicken/ w.e.) laying the egg, or the animal inside of the egg (the chicken). 

The fact that the egg has to be a chicken's egg in order for it to work as a paradox, implies the chicken owns the egg, and therefore the chicken comes first. Think math. Chicken + Possession of an Egg =  A Chicken's egg. We can't stop there tho, because who owns a soul/life/consciousness if not the body it's in?

A pro lifer would say life begins at conception. A pro choice standpoint argues 'my body, my choice. The pro choice argument obviously doesn't apply to eggs...since the egg has left the body, technically.

So how does all of this relate back to the chicken being the one that came first?

If you haven't guessed it by now, the chicken owns the egg it lays, even if life begins at conception, because a chicken egg is not made to be left in the wild, rather to be under the ownership of a caring mother until ready to hatch. 

That means ""proto chickens"" make ""proto chicken"" eggs that hatch into.......A CHICKEN! 

TL;DR: If you are an egg you have no rights."

benjix168,unpopularopinion,1620538167.0,Creationists are not necessarily flat earthers.,"I have been seeing this too much and I am tired of being lumped in with crazy people.

I want to start by saying that I am not a flat earther, never was and never will be. I base myself off what has been proven and observed.

With this out of the way, I also believe in creation. No, I do not believe the earth was made in 7 days, because a lot of things in the Bible are not meant to be taken literally, we have to use judgement and criticism to get a proper idea of anything.

Now to why, me, a perfectly sane person will believe in creation. I have 4 main arguments.

The first: life from non life is impossible. It has been calculated the odds for the favorable environment to be set for there to be an actual cell is 1/10(102). This is 102 zeroes. Mathematicians have also already established something is impossible if the odds of it happening is 1/10(50). It it thus many times impossible for life from non life. I won’t even talk about the chance there is of a random matter being pulled somehow in a random explosion creating beautiful galaxies and constellations and perfectly balanced. Bonus fun fact; it would be like having a disassembled clock in your hands, you throwing the whole thing in the air, and it lands already assembled. Edit: come on, I know it’s gravity, I just wrote as to say that saying it’s gravity does not explain everything.

The second: The concept of evolution is destroyed by a very simple fact; (and take the time to take that in) there is no genetic process that can make it so information is added in the DNA. What we did witness is horizontal evolution, aka natural selection, where fitting traits of survivors will be passed on to the next generation. There have been short-necked giraffes that did not survive because the vegetation died on the ground and only the tall ones survived, this is a fact. However, this process did not add anything, the genome is still the same lenght.

The third: we already know carbon dating calculates incorrectly. It has also been proven that carbon 14 exagerates exponentially when facing older stuff. We have carbon tested things we were sure of the dating, and the older they were the more carbon dating was giving a bigger age than what we knew as a fact was real. When doing the reverse math, what was millions of years, was in fact, around 4000-6000 years old.

The fourth: skeletons of half men half apes are incorrect. The nebraska man for example was based off the skull of an ape and the tooth of an extinct pig. The man of neanderthal was actually just a man with arthritis; https://historydaily.org/our-image-of-neanderthals-is-all-wrong-the-first-skeleton-was-arthritic
The list goes on and on and in the end, the is not one single cavemen half ape that exists.

My bonus argument; common sense. If you read through all this, thank you for reading. If you have questions or arguments or want references we can look that up together in the comments. For now, take a deep breath. Look outside the window and look at the sky. Contemplate our universe. Contemplate the beauty of our world. Contemplate how magnificent the stars are. Think of all the animals and dinosaurs that lived, about how intricate they are. About how we work and our bodies work, and what we can accomplish, and you know, deep down, maybe very deep down in you somewhere, that the world was not an accident. I won’t talk about religion, I just want you to think about all that, do the research, question everything and don’t believe in the first thing you’re told. I know it’s uncomfortable, but it’s worth it.

thr0w1tawayaccount,unpopularopinion,1620524368.0,I automatically think less of someone if they have a celebrity crush while they are in a committed relationship.,"If you think about it, if someone was in a committed relationship was talking about how much they had a crush on someone other than their partner people would be upset and that person's partner might consider it cheating. But somehow if that person's crush is a celebrity its considered okay. 

For example I know a married woman who has a huge crush on a famous rapper. She constantly posts ""I luv u babe, ur so hot 🔥🥵😍😩"" on everything that rapper posts on social media. She calls that rapper her other husband and gets her kids to call him their ""other dad"". She is just considered a super fan by most of the people around her. 

I know a lot of people that has a celebrity wife/husband and call me insecure but I think its unfair. It's like the person intentionally or not is comparing their spouse to that celebrity. I don't know if that makes me an insecure. I don't mind when people find celebs attractive but devoting a lot of time and energy to that celebrity seems foolish its even more foolish when someone pretends to be in a relationship with a celebrity. 

On another note I remember getting into a serious fight with an ex over a musician. I really liked their music and style and my ex accused me of wanting to sleep with that person. I couldn't explain that appreciation did not mean romantic attraction.

TheRealBucketCrab,unpopularopinion,1620506651.0,"League of Legends can be fine sometimes, but needs massive changes.","First of all, if you're playing soloq, don't expect a good experience because you're not getting one. Expect a ton of toxic kids that will shit on you regardless of what ""mistake"" you do. The community is generally trash.

But that doesn't account for playing with friends or friendly people in general. You're most likely going to have a good experience because of playing as a team and seeking victory.

About my second point, there's ""feeding"". It's absolutely unessecary and just ruins the game. If you get killed twice in your lane, it's very difficult to comeback or even farm in the first place (That wouldn't be the case if you're playing premade because of coordinated ganks). That problem is what CS:GO does NOT have. You can eco in CS:GO and you can comeback, even after losing 5 times in a row. I mean, imagine NBA, but if you're behind in points, you can't do donkey shit because the rivals are stronger now. This needs to change. LoL needs to be a less punishing towards mistakes and more rewarding towards skill. Being fed and destroying the enemy isn't skill, only the early game could be considered that.

A fix to this would be giving MUCH less gold for a kill, a way for underleveled players leveling up without the threat of getting ganked, something similar to eco (a one life item that allows you to comeback if you kill), MUCH more gold for killing a fed enemy etc."
tramsta,unpopularopinion,1620615638.0,"On Mother’s Day or other holidays, moms deserve more than pictures of their kids/grandkids and/or tablets that function to show those pictures","Disclaimer:  I am not a mom, yet.  

Every Mother’s Day and every holiday season, I get ads for some kind of picture book or app for adult children to gift to their moms, which will allow moms to look at pictures of said adult children and maybe grandchildren.  That’s advertised as THE gift that will make your mom feel happy and appreciated.  While it’s a good side gift, it should not be the only gift.  

To me, it’s narcissistic and thoughtless to make that the gift of the season to your mom.  You really think that after raising a human for 18 years, (maybe) paying for college, etc., the thing a mom would love most on a holiday/the one day dedicated to mothers are pictures of her adult offspring?  Ever wonder if instead,  mom might like a gift that is something she wants... something about her? 

Now, I get that moms love pictures of their kids and grandchildren.  That is something that she should receive on any random day or in addition to other gift(s).  While she might enjoy looking at pictures of her offspring, a mom is her own individual person with her own hobbies and interests.  She deserves to be valued as such.  

This rant isn’t targeted at anyone here.  It’s sparked by the endless ads I see.  I admit that the thought of only getting my mom gifts that are about me makes me sad.  I just think that after dedicating so much to raising kids, moms should be celebrated, not reduced to worshippers of their adult children."

Now on to why I think this is so: congestion. In a city/town, it's normal for cars to be quite cramped on the roads, requiring attention and sharp reflexes to avoid any accidents. Furthermore, there are a lot more potential hazards that can arise (a child chasing a ball out onto the road, a pair of workmen carrying a sheet of glass, etc). Contrast this with a typical motorway: there's much more space between cars, thus reducing the quickness of reaction needed to avoid crashing into someone. Plus, there are no pedestrians to randomly decide to cross the road. Finally, you can often see much further ahead on a motorway than a city road, allowing you to spot hazards ahead of time.

So yeah, that's about it. Remember: I do not condone texting and driving. Stay safe everyone.

WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO CHEESY AND CHILDISH. So much of it is so uninteresting and dull, especially Rebels and Clone Wars. Most of it was just so poorly executed.

WhatTheFlummox,unpopularopinion,1620613363.0,Towels work better as bath mats than actual bath mats,"**tl;dr** 

>Use a towel instead. They're functionally better in every way.

I've never understood the appeal of bath mats. Sure, maybe they're soft and cushy, but they just soak up water and don't dry very well at all, especially if you live with multiple people who use the same shower and/or bath frequently. They can take extra effort to wash and dry (especially if they have a plastic base), and their quality really declines once they start to get worn out.

So you have a several choices (there are probably more than just what I've listed here, but these are what come to mind): 

1) You can hang the bath mat up to dry when you're not using it.

>I have seen people do this. It takes up space on your towel rack that you could be using for towels. Even worse, it is no fun to be next in line for a shower when you have to take an already-wet mat off the rack. Lastly, as someone who doesn't do this, when visiting homes of people who do, I've often forgotten to place the mat down before getting in the shower and then I'm in bigger trouble.

2) You can just leave it on the ground and deal with an occasionally sopping wet bath mat. 

>This is what I did all through my childhood with my siblings. Would not recommend.

3) You can wait until you're mostly dry before getting out of the shower or bath. 

>Sounds cold and boring. 

4) You can try to keep your towel somewhere within reach of your shower/bath so you can dry off before stepping onto the bath mat.

>Perhaps this works well for some people, but I know I would forget to prepare ahead of time. Plus, not all bathrooms are set up with an easy way to achieve this.

5) You can keep a dedicated towel on the floor instead.

>This is what I currently do and I love it. Towels cover way more surface area than typical bath mats; they dry really quickly, even when you leave them on the floor; they're super easy wash and dry with the rest of your laundry during regular cycles; and even worn-out towels work perfectly for this purpose. In fact, worn-out towels are exactly the kind of towels you want to use. 

  
I first used a towel instead of a bath mat after I had recently washed my bath mat and had hung it up to dry, but still needed to take a shower. I have since gotten rid of my bath mat entirely and now use only towels."

5_out_of_7_perfect,unpopularopinion,1620498915.0,Initial drug use and subsequent addiction are due to lack of discipline,"For example, I'm not going to wake up one day and tell myself, ""I feel like getting addicted to heroin"", without ever using heroin before. The choice to use harmful drugs is your choice, and your choice alone. From my experience working in rehab, the majority people tend to blame everything else on their addiciton, except themselves. The first step to getting sober is taking accountability and admitting that you have a problem. However, from what I've seen, most addicts lack the mental discipline to overcome their addiction. Becoming sober is too inconvenient and uncomfortable to them, and a lot of addicts don't like to be in mental/physical discomfort, which is why they fall back on their addiction. 

Lack of discipline, and weak mental fortitude are why addicts stay addicts. That's my cold hard unpopular opinion that addicts don't want to hear.

Rehab gives an addict every single source they need to become sober. Sobriety is not something that can be forced. It has to be wanted by the addict. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

I worked in rehab for a year. Truth be told, most of the clients who came through were generally nice people, when they're sober. The problem is, they need an authority/environment to keep them sober, because they can't do it on their own. Rehab has an embarrassingly low success rate. Somewhere around 18% or so. It varies depending on the study, but always low. 

It's disheartening when you go above and beyond to help addicts become sober, only to see them return. Some of them purposefully relapse and return because they know that as long as they're in rehab, they're in a sober environment. Some people return because they're homeless and relapse on purpose for a bed and a meal for a period of time. Some people relapse and return because they want time off work. 

My unpopular opinion is that most addicts stay addicts because they don't have the discipline to overcome their adversity.

Edit: it's an opinion. Downvote if you feel it doesn't suit your tastes.

Edit 2: there are plenty of other ways to redirect addiction in ways that don't destroy your friends or family."

ThatMakhasheyfe,unpopularopinion,1620599973.0,Companies should be held criminally liable for not protecting employees against horrible customers,"Stress kills people and few things cause people who are paid to interact with the general public as much stress as horrible customers. It is generally accepted as fair and just that when other employees create a hostile work environment, the company is legally obligated to put a stop to it. Yet, when customers are involved, people suddenly think that holding the company liable goes too far. This makes no sense. Why should it matter that the person who is creating the hostile work environment doesn't get paid by the company if they are permitted access to the premises by said company?

Companies enable karens of all walks of life by letting them terrorize the employees repeatedly without consequences. Whether or not you have protection against this abuse as an employee depends entirely on which building you work in and who the manager is. This is unacceptable.

Sure, having consequences for companies that don't take the problem seriously may not solve the problem, but it's something rather than nothing. Employees should be able to report their employer's consistent failure to act against abusive customers and see results.

Edit: I should clarify. I am making the comparison to workplace harassment for a reason. The customers I am talking about here are repeat offenders who are demonstrably, consistently abusive to staff.

An instance of a coworker being unpleasant or one report of misconduct against them neither results in their termination, nor does it qualify as them creating a hostile work environment in most cases. It has to be an ongoing problem with that coworker in particular for the company to become liable.

That's the same type of situation I am talking about: repeat customers who terrorize staff. There should be some consequences for companies that tie their employees' hands and ignore a persistent problem with an abusive customer who has shown a pattern of horrible behavior towards staff."

weslington1,unpopularopinion,1620649644.0,Being your own role model > looking upto celeb role models,"I know what you're about to say. Weslington, you must be feeling different or had something in your drink.

&#x200B;

Well, I've got news for you. I feel like, if we(as individuals) decide to have dreams of being the best/better version of ourselves, instead of fantasing over celebs or those around us we could make more progression.

&#x200B;

My main rationale behind this is simple:

1. If you follow celebs as role-models, you can quickly start to be like them, instead of being yourself
2. You can easily see their progress as your benchmark, instead of setting your own benchmarks and using those around you to help you reach it, exceed it and do better
3. You start to feel what they feel - e.g. Let's say, you like kanye and kanye is sad because kimk has left him, all of a sudden, now you're feeling sad, despite having NO relation to kim or kanye, but because you idolised kanye, now you're basically emulating his feelings

I understand, that sometimes changing your perspective on how you view certain things, can be a barrier, particularly if you view someone as your role-model. So, I'm willing to give you some practical steps, to help change how you view your life differently(while maximising the better version of you):

1. Start with why - why am I doing this thing? If you don't have any true why, that feels like it's bigger than you, than you likely don't want that thing bad enough
2. Who do I know? Many people, usually jump to thing -> solve. Instead, why not just use those around you to help you achieve that goal or at least start working towards that goals
3. How - Once, you've exhausted who you know(and possibly some independent resources) now it's time to see how to do the thing you're trying to do

Now, I know what you're about to ask, how does this relate to celebs. Well, with celebs:

* you might see step 1 and be like 'Ok kim k, left kanye because of lack of money .... Soooooo, I can leave my bf or gf because he's broke' - which, of course is bad, but if you somewhat idolise that celeb, then you'll feel pressured to do the same.
* Step 2 - ok... who - easy - my bf/gf
* How - just copy paste what kim k did

In as much this sounds ideal, you'll quickly realise that doing what others do in exactly the same way they did it, can come with some serious repercussions if not delivered well....

&#x200B;

That's all I have to say.

TL;DR : Always make sure, you know yourself before you decide to copy/paste what a celeb has done."

But when Jim started dating Karen, Pam who rejected Jim not once but twice, became very jealous about their relationship. And confronted Jim in front of Karen (Although Pam only talked about their friendship but it was totally a bitch move and pretty uncomfortable for Karen). Because of Pam's confrontation Jim literally dumped Karen. Total simp move.


2. Athlead: Jim threw away his new position in a company he cofounded and literally gave up his dream just because his wife didn't want to move into a new city. That really pissed me off.

I remember the anticipation building before each flight when you went to the flight magazine to see what would be showing on that day’s flight, and I remember the dread inevitably setting in and wishing you were on some other route. “Awh shucks, I have to watch Batman & Robin because I’m Europe eastbound, but the people on ‘Pacific Westbound’ get to watch Titanic!” 

This isn’t a tale of masochism. When the movie was great, everyone was in a better mood. When it sucked, we wallowed together. That collective spirit was worth something, more than what I gain from having my choice of movie.

It was also an exercise in discipline  and patience we all can use time to time. Don’t like the movie? Listen to the radio. Take a nap. You don’t always get what you want. Sure, you’re paying, but payment doesn’t entitle you to whatever episode of Friends you want to watch, or live sports.

So bring back those raggedy-ass projectors and let’s ride the wave of uncertainty - together."

All of your friends and family members have also gone through the ringer, but they shouldn't be the ones to pay for your luxuries. I think this is an unpopular opinion due to the sheer amount of money these people usually raise. 

Also, performer friends who sing or improv or whatever online weekly and make a bit out of people donating.

Vyrnoa,unpopularopinion,1620625144.0,Album covers are just as important as the music itself,"I feel like often times some (especially small) bands and artists dont really put enough thought or effort into their album covers. For me it just ruins the experience. The music can be great, but the whole project can be ruined if the art sucks. Its supposed to be a complete piece of the whole project. That includes the music, the quality, the art, the covers, the packadging etc. 

It makes no sense for people who put in hard work for music they make then just as a final lazy step slap on a random, ugly, unfitting album cover that ruins the piece creating an incoherent mess. 
I lose all interest in a band if the music is good but all of their covers suck. An album cover is art as well. Its supposed to display the vibe/mood/aesthetic of the music. Its supposed to accompany something beautiful. Which ties it all together.

The album cover is also just art like the music itself, it has value because all of it is in the same category. And should be. 

Bad album covers suck because:

First impressions are important to the viewer

They ruin the experience and creates a lazy mess

They ruin the flow of the work

It makes me not want to buy any of the merch or the album itself because why would i want to wear an ugly pic on my clothes. 

I want to support good bands but it just makes me cringe seeing this happen.
I feel like not many people care about this and thats fine but i cant help but feel that it bothers me whenever i see bad cover art"
daphnejmorgan,unpopularopinion,1620485943.0,John Barrowman doesn’t deserve the abuse he is getting,"Contrary to what some would have you believe, flashing is not an inherently predatory act. Sometimes it genuinely is just a funny prank. How many of you have mooned or been mooned by someone else? 

It all depends on who you are with and what the overall vibe is. Most people can read the room and know when it is and isn’t  appropriate to pull their bits out for a laugh. 

My brother and I flash each other all the time but, being siblings, there is an implicit understanding between us that that there is nothing sinister or sexual about it. We literally just do it for a laugh. The same goes for John, who is gay. His female colleagues know that he poses no real threat to them. They understand and participate in the banter. Think about it for a second. If they were truly disturbed or embarrassed by it, would they really be sharing funny anecdotes about “Little Barrowman” at conventions?

To sum up, hardly any of John’s fellow cast members have a bad thing to say about the man and it is not on us to get offended on other people’s behalves."

SomeWh1teDood,unpopularopinion,1620438402.0,In a way it is genius to be religious,"I'm saying this from a agnostic perspective. I dont believe in x God right now. But what I do believe is what we believe, is much more likely to become a self fulfilling prophecy, compared to if we don't believe it. Look at all the athletes, or people who have ever done something. It started with a belief for most of them. You'll find few people who say they made it to X spot without the belief. Its not the belief itself, but what the belief does for you.

If you believe a God is there and is gonna help you live your best life, and that everything bad that happens to you is to make you stronger, and that you are gonna live the best life possible to due a loving God caring about you, of course it will make you more likely to take risks and try your best to overcome obstacles. It doesn't matter if its wrong or right the belief (unless theres a God that cares) it only matters that this belief helps you live your life. So to the atheists who call it fully stupid, I think they are wrong af in this aspect.

. But if you think that reality is a meaningless fluke that that theres no God, its only yourself. Sure you can do great things in life but it can be more difficult to have faith when you believe theres no law in the universe that will give you X thing. Even if being religious is delusional, its got a hint of genius on it because it allows you to have a greater perspective than many. It doesn't eve need to be a belief in a God. It can be a belief in that life is a simulation and you are player 1, or your life is a movie. Whatever. Even if it is delusional, you can call it whatever, but I still think its got some genius written all over it."

Affectionate_Hall385,unpopularopinion,1620459952.0,I think less of people who are picky eaters,"So, a caveat.  This judgement doesn’t really apply to people whose pickiness is driven by them being neuro-atypical.  I know a few people who have OCD or autism that seriously manifests in the preference for food and discomfort with trying new foods, and I wouldn’t judge them for that.

That said, if you’re a grown-ass adult who isn’t willing to try new foods, who needs to order off the kids menu because all you’ll eat is chicken fingers or macaroni, or will shut down a group’s plan to eat at a certain restaurant because you “don’t like X cuisine” it’s seriously going to lower my opinion of you.

I think there’s a few elements to it.  One, I think in many cases it leads to disrespectful behavior.  I don’t think anyone needs to *enjoy* everything, but I do think that people should be willing to *try* most things.  If someone is having you over to their home for a meal and they put time and effort into cooking for you, I honestly think it’s kind of inexcusable not to willing to at least eat a bite of what’s being put on your plate.  Maybe this is different for people who were raised in cultures that don’t value food or meals as much, but to me there’s something just really gross about someone preparing food for you and you being unwilling to even touch it.

Second, I feel like it speaks to being sheltered in a way that I find off-putting on a personal level.  Growing up, either because of limitations in terms of time and money, or because my family had a diverse set of friends and relatives, I didn’t always get to eat what I wanted.  Sometimes, you had a plate put in front of you with shit on it that was unfamiliar, even daunting, and if you wanted to eat and not offend the person serving you you ate it.  If a child can do that, I don’t see any good reason that an adult can’t.

To that same point, I feel like it reflects a degree of close-mindedness.  Maybe it’s my personal bias and love of food speaking.  But unless a restaurant is just shit, I feel like there’s going to be something that most people will find tasty and inoffensive on the menu.  If you’re writing off entire diverse, expansive cuisines based on the fact that they seem scary, or you had one dish you didn’t like, or you smelled something unfamiliar I don’t have any patience for it.

Buck up, grow a spine, and try new things.  It isn’t that hard, and chances are you’ll find something you like.

Edit:  I’ll extend my caveat to serious dietary restrictions, within reason.  You have a life threatening soy allergy, so you’d prefer we don’t get Chinese?  Fair enough.  You can’t eat shellfish, so you won’t we trying the stew my mom made?  Totally get it — no hard feelings.  You’re gluten intolerant, so refuse to let the group get Italian, or Indian, or French, or Mediterranean, or...?  Naw, miss with that."

RaptorRoll,unpopularopinion,1620627724.0,Smithers from Simpsons doesn’t deserve sympathy,"Smithers from Simpsons doesn’t deserve sympathy imo, despite the writers lately frequently now trying to make him a sympathetic character or a moral representative in eps.

I’ve seen a lot of cases where he just looks down his nose at everyone except for Burns. He doesn’t care about anyone else and he looks down at the other employees. Examples of this are:

1. The episode where Smithers tries to get Homer fired for using Dimoxonil, and takes visible delight in this.
2. The episode where they have a skiing team-building skiing trip, and Smithers gets so upset he’s not put with Burns and may get fired, not caring about any other employee.
3. The episode where Smithers needs to find a temporary replacement for him and searches for “lazy, incompetent, monstrously ugly”, showing what he thinks of the other employees. He may well have entered these comments himself. There are also many other examples showing how he looks down at Homer.
4. He also wants Burns to be completely dependent on him in this ep and in general, even if it’s not Burns’s preference, and physically attacks Homer later in the ep.
5. In the ep where Burns starts recycling, Burns is invited for a speech at the beginning, and Smithers talks back to Lisa at one point like “How dare you talk to Mr Burns that way!” Showing he will aggressively defend Mr Burns even from children.

Despite this, they’ve tried to make him some sort of sympathetic character or moral representative in the recent seasons, such as the ep where he helps Moe re-cater his bar towards a gay crowd and Moe is painted as the greedy one with no values while Smithers is the one with morals.

His infatuation with Burns imo was just a bit of a ludicrous thing and a source of silly humour, a silly joke not meant to be taken seriously, but now it seems recently they’ve tried to paint this relationship as something to actually take seriously and it’s a bit cringy, and paint him as a character we’re supposed to root for or feel sympathy for or to demonstrate morals, and I’m just not buying it."
QualityQualia,unpopularopinion,1620643965.0,Climate change is actually good.,"Almost all sources of easily visible and retrievable information on climate change focuses on the negative aspects of climate change when in reality there will be major benefits that are simply overlooked or out shadowed by the doom sayers not too much unlike  ""The End is Nigh"" folk on the street you see occasionally. Yes there is scientific evidence of oceans rising, warming climates, more intense whether, and other changes that could have a negative impact on life... when you only look at that in isolation from the benefits of climate change and the benefits of the pollution's source (such as oil). 

&#x200B;

The warming climate will decrease the amount of land in far north areas on earth covered in ice allowing for the creation of new more cultivatable and easily livable land, yes  the oceans will slowly force people to move in land but that isn't a change that is by itself a disaster. Floods and other such natural disasters can either be solved by moving, or developing technology to prevent such disasters from ruining peoples lives. There is also the fact that most of this land with be a part of either Canada or Russia but I'll ignore this point because that isn't about climate change. 

The increase in CO2 promotes plant growth. While this can be both a good and bad aspect, I would find it hard to believe this along with the other factors of climate change could cause a large collapse in the food supply. Genetic engineering and other technology is getting to a point where we could create plants capable of adapting to the new changes pollution will cause to the earth. We already do to a certain extent. Fish and other sources of food are now starting to be farmed to a larger degree and to expect otherwise is ridiculous, you would expect these kinds of farming tech to improve over time especially by the time ""climate change becomes dangerous"".

Now think of all the effects that will occur because people are damaging industry and production by enacting laws that hinder oil and other pollution producing industries. People tend to think that hindering these industries ""saves lives"" but really you may be just saving a few at the sacrifice of many but this isn't my main point and is ranty just something to ponder.

As for weather, it won't be a linear graph of more people dying the warmer it gets. Climate change might increase deaths by hurricanes, and it also might decrease deaths from frostbite.

In general Human's and all living things are quite adaptable, i don't see disaster as the only possible future to expect from climate change.

stinky-cat112,unpopularopinion,1620577087.0,"People who are 16-17 are not ""children"" or ""kids""","I don't think 16-17 year olds should be considered ""kids"", and I'm tired of people pretending and acting like people who are 16-17 lack critical thinking abilities, don't know what they're talking about or doing, and excuse their behaviour just because they're ""kids"".

I'm turning 20 and I still very clearly remember what it was like and how I was like as a 15, 16, 17, 18 year old. By 15, I was already figuring out my identity. At 16 year old my general personality started to become more established. By 17 I was pretty much a proto ""adult"", and at 18 where I would legally be considered an adult, I honestly really wasn't any different than what I was like at 17. I didn't magically become an adult at 18, it was a process that really started for me at 15.

So I really don't understand where the rhetoric of ""16/17 year olds are just kids"" because they're really not? Sure, my highschool classmates weren't the most mature and neither was I, we were still petty as hell back then, but we definitely knew what we were doing and had a basic understanding of how to act, how to be polite, what to do and what do say. We were essentially young adults by 16.

I'm really tired of people coddling or overprotecting 16-17 year olds on the internet because they're ""kids"", or using the argument to justify their shitty behaviour i.e. 17 year olds on twitter arguing with 18 year olds saying ""how does it feel to be bullying a MINOR"" when they're only a year older?

In my experience in school (not American) we were learning about historical wars and atrocities at 15, so why do people feel like 16-17 year olds need to be protected so badly on the internet?

Obviously the growing up process is different for everyone, and I'm definitely NOT trying to justify ANY predatory behaviour towards this age group (don't be a creep). But from my own experience and from observing my peers around me, 16-17 year olds aren't kids. They're pretty much young adults at that point, if they're being a little shit that's just them and we need to start holding them accountable!"

2: Now to a layman, many of these guys appear to be armed to the teeth with vests and the AsSaLT RiFlE 15s, however as someone in the business I can tell you that most of these guys are absolutely not on-par with the us military, both in equipment and in training. The Middle Eastern  insurgents aren't either but the boogers are definitely better equipped when it comes to small arms than the insurgents. The boogers also have steady access to the internet and their formal education is way better than most insurgents which leads to better tactics and communication and overall survivability. 

Where the insurgents take the win is that they have more access to heavy weapons and ordinance. To spite popular believe, it is extremely difficult to optaine explosive ordinance in the US and any heavy weapon that falls into the definition of destructive device. The fact that US soil has been war free for such a long time means there isn't stuff just laying around.

Another note, there would be a large amount of us service members that sympathize with their cause, much more so than the insurgents in the middle east. There sure are now, atleast where their current ideology stands. 

I just used then as an example but this would go for pretty much any armed US political group

Kaptin_Odium,unpopularopinion,1620558910.0,Doom Eternal just failed to be DOOM,"I'm a fan of DOOM and it's been my childhood and teen's life when Doom 2016 reboot got released it was awesome I loved it then a few years later they released a sequel called Doom Eternal however eternal just was big fuck you to me as they have completely changed the gameplay mechanics. They broke the game's original gameplay core for the sake of their rock/paper/scissors bullshit.

The story itself has plot holes and makes little sense you start on some slayer base without explaining how you got there and why is suddenly VEGA inside your armor when your previous armor couldn't power him and why you have new armor. Nothing makes sense.

Excessive platforming: I understand the devs wanted to make exploration / non-combat gameplay more creative with the platforming, but they overdid it so much that it becomes a pain and a chore very fast. This is coming from a person who loves both Mirror's Edge games - games where the platforming is the entire gameplay. However, ME's did it well; something that I cannot say about Doom Eternal. Quite often you wonder where to jump next. Some of the jumps require absolutely perfect double jump, dash, dash combo timing in order to reach ledges. Regularly, I had issues with Doom Guy either not grabbing climbable walls by himself, or grabbing them unexpectedly, at which point I pressed the Use key myself in order to grab them, which in turn caused me to let go of the walls. Frustrating to say the least. What's worse, platforming makes up approximately 30% of the whole game. This makes me miss the long, 'boring' (i.e. beautifully looking, atmospheric and full of little details) corridors they were attempting to replace.

Entire combat loop: I am all for changing the combat a bit, but Eternal's combat is over-designed and bloated with pointless mechanics that nobody asked for:

\- Why add dashes? Nobody asked for them. What's worse, in order to balance things out, they reduced the player's movement speed. What was the point then? Also, they are on a cooldown.

\- They added a super powerful Blood Punch but nerfed the regular punch so much that it barely does any damage. Also, it's on a cooldown (i.e. to be precise, it requires 2 Glory Kills to fill). You lift super heavy doors but you cannot kill a fragile zombie until you damage him???  Why do you need some predator ripoff blade to kill enemies? Why the fuck Doomguy looks like some bad parody at a predator. In 2016 you literally killed them with your own hands and that was brutal you killed weak possessed humans without effort showing how powerful you are and that only demons can face and now even a fucking small zombie is a threat.

\- Pistol is removed just why and why? I loved the pistol design in 2016, super weak but infinite ammo making it a really awesome starting weapon but noo just because some speedrunners beat the entire game with that pistol we must remove it they only see 1% of the entire player's base and don't give a fuck about the rest.

\- Flame Belch's (or Flame Puff as it should be called) one and only reason for existing is giving you Armor. The fire does not have any other effect on the enemies: they do not panic, they do not receive any debuff. I don't think they even receive any damage and if they do, it is so marginal, that it makes absolutely no difference. And it's on a cooldown.

\- Ice Bomb. An actually cool addition. Pun intended. On a cooldown.

\- Frag Grenade. Better than the one in Doom 2016, especially after upgrades. On a cooldown.

\- Chainsaw is now required to spam, in order not to run dry after firing your gun a couple of times: this is due to the fact that bigger enemies (anything that is not pure cannon fodder) are much more spongy than in Doom 2016 and you can carry even less ammo than in that game. In Doom 2016 I used it more as a f\*ck-this-demon-in-particular button and the ammo was a bonus. Here, you very rarely have the opportunity to do so, since you have to use it constantly to replenish ammo, which in turn causes you not to have enough fuel for the larger demons. Also, guess what: it recharges one pip of fuel i.e. it's on a cooldown.

See a pattern here? In order to be effective, you need to manage 6 (!) cooldowns as if it's an MMO. Doom 2016 had only one, since all the equipment items shared their cooldown.

Now, the entire combat cycle can be summed up like this:

1. Shoot at non cannon fodder demons

2. Run out of ammo after a minute

3. Run around looking for cannon fodder enemies, which die to a strong fart

4. Set them on fire, maybe freeze them (when desperate for health), chainsaw them

5. If you get damaged badly, skip to step 3.

Rinse and repeat. Add some Glory Kills during this cycle.

The combat loop changes a bit when the Marauder comes along:

1. Shoot at non cannon fodder demons while avoiding the Marauder

2. Run out of ammo after a minute while avoiding the Marauder

3. Run around looking for cannon fodder enemies while avoiding the Marauder

4. Set them on fire, maybe freeze them (when desperate for health), chainsaw them while avoiding the Marauder

5. If you get damaged badly, skip to step 3, while avoiding the Marauder

6. Once everything is dead aside from the Marauder, focus on him

7. Change your entire behavior that this, and the previous game, have taught you, by standing still and looking for a slight opening when the Marauder's eyes glow green, because this is a 1v1 fighting game now for some reason

8. Repeat step 7 until either of you is dead

Marauder's design is puzzling to me. As mentioned above, in order for you to be effective against him, you need to do everything opposite to what this series has taught you. Mind you, I'm not talking about the difficulty here: once you discover that you can use a quick SSG-Ballista-SSG combo on him, he stops being so intimidating. It's just he brings the entire pacing of the game to a screeching halt, more so than the platforming sections. You can't stay at long range because he throws axe slashes at you. You can't stay at close range because he shoots the SSG at you. You can't stay at midrange, the one designed to be his weakness, because he may still frigging use his ranged axe or SSG or spam you with wolves for no bloody reason. Oh, and you can't use any Super Weapon against him (unless you are lucky and he spazzes out), because people would just blow him away with a BFG, and rightly so. The designer's wanted to create a cool, challenging enemy, instead they created a personification of everything I dislike in this game. And therein lies the problem.

The fundamental issue with this game is the fact that it forces you play in a specific way. Previous games gave you the tools and said ""go and have fun!"". All guns were, more or less, effective. Yes, this ended up with a lot of people cheesing their way with the SSG and Gauss Cannon, but why prevent them from doing so? If they have fun doing it, why stop them? The devs wanted to prevent this behavior and changed their philosophy to ""play exactly like we tell you to play or die"". There is no experimentation, no fun discovery. You are literally told what to do against each enemy in a small tutorial screen. And if you fail to adhere to these instructions? Well, this is the reason that the bigger enemies are so damn bullet spongy when not fighting them the 'correct' way.

But you know what is the saddest thing in this whole situation? You can still cheese with the SSG, Rocket Launcher and Ballista (stand in for the Gauss Cannon), though now only to a certain extent. This is still the most effective way of fighting, especially on higher difficulties! So despite all of their effort, changing the entire combat flow, adding tons of pointless abilities and annoying enemies, they still failed to prevent cheesing. Pair this with the sucky platforming sections and you have the ultimate failure of design: attempting to approach minor issues with a frenzied exaggerated knee-jerk reaction akin to taking a sledgehammer to a porcelain vase.

Now I have buyer's remorse. I pre-ordered the $100+ Deluxe Edition. Sucks to be me, I guess. The worst of all is I know that Doom Eternal is going to sell exceedingly well and, due to this, they will never go back to their previous design philosophy. They will continue on with the current one and I will not be able to enjoy a new Doom game again. Very melodramatic I know, but this is the future I predict and accept. Time to move on."
CarelessHoliday6812,unpopularopinion,1620555000.0,"""It's better to have no friends than to have fake friends"" isn't always true.","People underestimate how hard having no friends is. They say that, but it just isn't applicable to everybody. Having no friends is draining, especially if you're in a bigger collective and are not a loner. 

I am an older teen and at school I went through both having fake friends and having no friends. I wasn't happy in either situation. But I'll say this - having fake friends was 100% better. 

Having no friends at school means you'll sit alone during lunch, have no one to do school projects with, no one to talk about the minor things that just pop out in your head, no one to go shopping with, no one to introduce you to inside jokes or rumors the class has together. And most importantly, you won't be seen with anybody. Other people will treat you like a trash because of it too - assume you're asocial, problematic, annoying and that's why you have no friends. Teachers too. 
I found it so much easier to just switch a friend group than to try to join a friend group from the position of an outcast. When trying to switch the group, people just seemed to value my presence more when they saw that I am very much capable of having other friends.

It's horrible to have fake friends, I know about that, but having no friends can be even worse. 
As long as it's not something extreme (like the friends publicly humiliating and bullying me), then I'd pick fake friends over no friends even if it means they'll talk trash about me behind my back and would magically disappear if some catastrophe happened."

It''s not classist if you can't afford a couple thousand in the case of the event that your dog is sick or gets injured. That means you can't afford a fucking animal.

I know CPS is dogshit but at the very least there are some measurements. If a kid isn't enrolled in school, misses too many days, or doesn't have insurance. Parents will end up being visited for a wellness check to make sure they are taking care of their kids. 

I don't understand why dogs can't have these measurements too and I feel like if someone keeps violating these basic requirements of making sure your dog is well maintained. They eventually will not be allowed to have an animal.

Ronnybeans,unpopularopinion,1620547761.0,Can we please stop using Helvetica and other similar minimalist fonts,"These stupid font are everywhere. EVERYWHERE. And no one talks about how it’s unbelievably overused! When you’re on Twitter, it’s the font used for writing everything. When you buy a product, there’s a good chance Helvetica is on it. So many companies (we’re talking thousands) use it for their logo design. GM, Toyota, Target, I could go on forever. 

As I’m writing this and you’re reading this, there’s probably five different advertising and marketing firms are looking at using Helvetica, Sans Serif, or some other bland uniform trash for the company logo or design. Whether it’s bold, thin, italic, oblique, it’s got to stop. Not every company needs to be minimalistic. There are probably over a hundred thousand or more different fonts. Why are companies so obsessed with their vibe being minimalistic instead of using typefaces unique to their overall mission? For example, Monster Energy has a cool logo and a good font to match with the logo, and on top of that it works with the spirit of the company. Rough, jagged, unknown, like a monster. 

At this point, when I see a cool font on a product or on a design of some sort, it catches my eye way more than minimalist fonts. When you make something look clean and plain and every freaking thing uses it, it all blends to create such bland taste in what we see. This really bothers me because just 10 years ago we had an amazing diversification in logos. And now it’s all the same."

  Now the reason I think that this is an unpopular opinion is because I've heard from a lot of people that steak is the best, and I have no clue how these people can like that shit. It tastes like sweaty rubbery nothing, and I swear they know it doesn't taste good on its own because they're always adding other shit to it. If its in beef form they add buns and lettuce and tomato and onions and pickles and cheese and ketchup and mustard to make it a burger, or they'll coat it in some weird sauce and call it a sloppy joe, or they'll add 10 pounds of seasoning to it and make it into meatloaf. If its in its raw steak form, they'll drench it in some BBQ sauce named after a random American city or state (like Louisiana BBQ or Memphis BBQ or some shit) and other seasonings and slow cook it for like 5 hours so that the little flavor that's in the saturated fat content of the meat comes out as grease just so it'll actually taste like something.

Basic hygiene should be a given, that’s not what I’m talking about here. I feel I shouldn’t need to emphasise such a thing, especially if the last almost two years has highlighted anything. But being tidy isn’t always possible, especially if your living spaces are small. The cost to upgrade such a space is well talked about and well known. I’m also greatly stressing the clean **and** tidy. 

I am an immigrant that came to the country I live without a lot of possessions. I have never been much of a hoarder and everything I own (unrelated to emergency situations) has been used within the past two years. My place never looks tidy as I can only afford to live in rented accommodation, in a place that hasn’t been significantly updated since the 90s. 

I would love to repaint my place to that all the walls no longer have scratches and smears, I would love to put in a new kitchen and make better use of the space in it, as I don’t own the property I live in I am unable to do this. 

I’m trying to get a better job, but Covid has killed my old income stream and almost frozen progress on my visa which has further limited my options, but it’s almost impossible to get out of this hole. With more money I could upgrade my living space, expand my living space and/or redecorate everything which is run down. 

It doesn’t matter how much I wipe and clean my old furniture and housing, it will never look clean and tidy unless I have the income to replace and improve on all that I need to. 

TL;DR, being clean and tidy is significantly easier if you have the space to store everything and a consistent income to keep up appearances within a living space."

**ex** **#1:** Dog owner approaches me at a park, coffee shop, hiking trail, etc. with a big smile on their face. “Xyz wants to say hi,” they announce, all grins and giving me an expectant look as their dog has already superglued their tongue to my hands.

I hate that I don’t get a choice in the matter. Before I have the chance to say no, fifi the havanese is already in my lap, slobbering on my face. Your dog’s tongue shouldn’t be touching your lips let alone mine.

**ex** **#2:** A particularly offensive scenario occurred after having to evacuate my apartment. I had to scramble to get a habitually anxious cat into a carrier and bring her to a noisy place full of evacuees. A woman approaches me with her (very cute) Australian Shepard, announcing her dog wants to visit as the dog has already stuffed its nose through a hole in the carrier. AGAIN, I DON’T WANT TO PET YOUR DOG. I do not want your dog whining/barking against the cage door of a shaking, terrified cat. How can you be so obtuse? I explained that the cat was nervous, and is scared of dogs. She backed away without complaint, but I resent that the onus is on me to set these boundaries. If I wanted to pet your dog, I would ask. Bringing him to me and another animal sans my request is honestly just rude. This kind of thing happens at the vet all the time, too. *My cat also thinks your dog sucks, fuck off.*

I want to clarify that I’m not advocating for the removal of dogs in public spaces. Dogs should be free to visit trails, parks, and any indoor area where they are allowed/wherever else dogs go. I appreciate the fact that dogs are autonomous animals who may insist on approaching others, but I really dislike the pressure associated with these interactions.

To add onto that, I often catch flack for this. If I withdraw/say no thanks, it earns me glares/passive aggressive tones/comments such as, “come on xyz, you can’t please everyone”.

Dog people, please understand that I appreciate your friendliness, and that I understand your actions are good-natured. I just don’t want to interact with your dog. Please be more conscientious and recognize that not everyone likes dogs. Just as it is common courtesy to ask before petting someone’s dog, dog owners should ask before letting their dog interact with others.

NerdismOfficial,unpopularopinion,1620570809.0,“Scott Tenorman Must Die” is NOT the best South Park episode.,"It’s a great episode and it really develops Cartman’s psychopathic character arc, but it’s not the best the show has ever made. That honor, in my opinion, goes to Margaritaville.

Personally, I think Margaritaville perfectly embodies what the show is capable of. Two plots, both relating to the same issue, both hilarious as hell, and both providing insightful commentary that manages to not be tone-deaf (unlike ManBearPig and Butt Out).

The plots themselves and the gags within them almost perfectly satirize the wacky state of the economy during the great recession. Connecting virtue-signaling about economics to biblical stories is genius, and honestly one of the most creative ideas ever. The idea that a stupid frozen drink blender can be artificially worth $90 trillion because of integration with the stock market is laughable but somehow plausible, and so is the whole “the federal reserve cuts a chicken’s head off and lets the body run around on a giant game board to decide shit” joke.

South Park is known for zany humor and spontaneous ridiculousness, and I think Margaritaville represents the peak of the show."

But when I eat chocolate, it always leaves an uncomfortable feeling on your mouth while chewing it (unless the chocolate is crunchy) and it just feels very sticky and leaves your mouth all f\*cked for a while and eating too much just doesn’t feel well.

sometimes chocolate also feels very strong on taste which makes it 2 times as uncomfortable than it already is which also leads to getting a dirty arse mouth.

im not saying chocolate is bad, but honestly sometimes it gets really close to that, and by the way it is torture to your teeth if you eat excessively "

robertobaggio20,unpopularopinion,1620503524.0,"Son of Sam documentary, Maury was an awful journalist and person","There are some obvious points. He clearly led David Berkowitz and didn't ask any questions. He didn't want to hear the truth. Some of his links were tenuous in the extreme and to the point where I even think he invented certain types of ""evidence"". Almost all of the Satanist cult part had no connection, the process disbanded two years before the killings. Charles Manson was just inserted to sell more copies of his book. There were lots of clear and obvious explanations that he purposefully ignored in order to sensationalise this aspect. 

He clearly tried to profit from interviews, fear and conspiracy. The parts of his writing that were read in the documentary were very low in quality and inconsistent (for example he'd call Berkowitz ""Son of Sam"" but then say that he wasn't and it wasn't him) . Sometimes it felt like a teenager writing in high school. His writing was also very egotistical. He wanted to be at the centre of everything. He clearly neglected his wife practically from the first time they met and was an alcoholic for most of his life. He was not interested in working with police and solving cases and was more interested in self-promotion. He took advantage of victims. The reason he kept struggling to gain credibility was because he had none. He also clearly contributed very little journalistically."
Wizardc438,unpopularopinion,1620636889.0,Art is useless and a waste of time and resources when taught in school,"I think art is no more than hobby but not a part of culture or something world changing. I don’t think it’s important and I don’t think everyone should be forced to do it in school. For some people it might be fun, but those can do it at home, in their free time if they want to but to tell me I have to do it and actually giving out grades for your work even if you really don’t care is just pointless. I see no Argument why everybody should be taught in art. It’s nothing like mathematics or English classes. In those classes you learn something you can actually use and that makes sense. Even though you might not have fun you still see the reason. With art I don’t have that feeling, it never helped society to progress, you can’t use it in everyday life and if you’re not passionate about art you won’t create anything spectacular anyway. 
Man I’m mad.



Edit: Just a disclaimer, I see a lot of people in the comments who actually already uploaded art on Reddit, I don’t mean to hate on you or your hobby. I just don’t think it belongs in school as I think there are more important than swinging a pencil over a piece of paper."

Cyclyasis,unpopularopinion,1620605570.0,FNF remastered mods look like bullshit,"Alright, let's talk about FNF remastered mods. Okay, so first off the characters look poorly drawn and rushed. I mean seriously, the proportions are awkward, and the legs + arms look unbalanced. Let's use Zavodila remastered as an example: 

This part is hard to explain, but in 2d form the remastered ruv's shoes proportions are insanely weird, I mean it literally looks like he broke his ankle or something. 

Second of all, there are so much frames that they don't even look like they match up with the music, considering it's at like 30 or 60 fps. The sprites are just kinda delayed with the music. 

Third, it looks like the characters are breaking their legs. With so much movement, for example twisting, (zavodila remaster) makes ruv look like he's doing jojo poses, and not in a good way.

Fourth, eye placement (proportions reference) is weird, since the eyes are literally going off ruvs head.

Honestly the only good remaster I found was the tord remaster."
shadowpillow,unpopularopinion,1620444981.0,Why take on the weight of the world – focus on your own priorities,"Regarding social issues and caring about them –

This is probably a pretty unpopular idea, but I think one of the real abnormalities of the modern world is this need to take on the pressure of everybody's else's problems. The idea that you /need/ to contribute to society. The idea that we /have/ to keep up with all of this, or else... what?

I get that it's largely because of globalization and the news becoming so accessible. It's human to hear about a problem and want to fix it. It's good to care. But taking on the weight of the world on your shoulders... What's the point? It doesn't fix anything. You're a person too. Isn't your happiness valuable too, not just a stranger's? Why not when you're trying to make the world a better place, start with your life too? When you're happier, the other people around you will be too, and that has a percolating effect. When you start getting down and taking on the weight of everything, or feeling anxious about needing to contribute, instead you will only hurt yourself and the people around you, and render yourself less capable of actual doing anything anyway.

Focusing on one issue at a time is good. Living your life is good. There's only so much you can do as one person; decide your own priorities and what you want to do. If that means fighting for a cause to better the world, great. If that means trying to get a high-paying job so that you can support your future family and kids, great. We each have our own priorities and fights. No need to take on the pressure of the world upon ourselves; there's no ultimate meaning or reason to anyway. We are all just people, with our own lives, priorities and reasons, personal history, dreams, and goals.

So why take on the weight of the world? It doesn't do you or anybody else any good."

These people have a life and they do a job, whether it's athlete actor or musician, their obligation is to do the job well not sign your notebook. The billionaires who own them forced them to interact with fans so to keep up appearances but then it’s creating a feedback loop

laddlemkckey,unpopularopinion,1620586175.0,Neither DOOM 2016 or DOOM Eternal are better than each other.,"DOOM Eternal has much stronger combat and arenas, but is ultimately a lot more flawed overall, and even has not as consistent level design, and often has more annoying bugs and mechanics. 

DOOM 2016, one could say it's much stronger as an overall experience with the superior presentation, aesthetics, atmosphere, bosses, story etc... But tge arenas and combat for the most part don't push the FPS genre as far, or has as much depth. However it's more consistent and focused and consistent. But it doesn't push mechanics or teach you to be a better FPS player nearly as much as Eternal does, so Eternal can often reach higher heights in general FPS mechanics and accomplishments in the genre as a whole in many ways. 

Eternal can often be more fun and experimental at times, but the general experience outside of the combat, doesn't leave nearly as strong as an impression. 

Overall Eternal's better mechanically and combat-wise, DOOM 2016 still having amazing combat and design has much stronger experience, vibe, and consistency to it. 

Both games have their strengths and weaknesses, and I am not really sure if either game is necessarily inferior or superior to each other. 

I like both games equally, but I might give the slight edge to 2016 because I feel Eternal's much more flawed and buggy, and I don't like Eternal's art style and atmosphere nearly as much. 

Also I AM Vega is my favorite level in anything ever."

Signal_Board_3832,unpopularopinion,1620467593.0,Twitter is only bad if you decide to follow toxic accounts,"It's boggling my mind that so many Redditors think that Twitter is a very bad and toxic place.

Speaking from my personal perspective, I have been on Twitter since 2017 and am still on Twitter regularly everyday.  And since 2017, I have never ever read a single toxic tweets. The reason is because I only follow people from the academia, scientists and official government as well as NGO accounts. These accounts actually provide very good information and can be very helpful.

In the end, I think that it all depends on who you follow and what you do with the app. Twitter of course can be bad, but it's your decision to see bad tweets."
clivehack,unpopularopinion,1620599875.0,Big rooms suck,Dont get me wrong. I mean having one big room that is huge without any walls is stupid because if you have several rooms you have for example a bed room and a dining room. If you have both combined in a big room you will always have that smell of the food that was eaten in your bedroom. You also have a calm athmosphere in your bedroom but not in your homeoffice. There is also no privacy. If you buy a new house and just smash all the walls you don't need out of the house you should think twice because if you are planning to have children it is better for you and them to have a little privacy. All in all in my opinion it is better to have one room for each purpose than one room for all purposes.
Dead_Revive_07,unpopularopinion,1620552437.0,Skyscrapers are overrated!,"Skyscrapers display a country wealth however Skyscrapers isn't needed anywhere.  Take Europe for example, after WWII, Europe had a chance to rebuild from scratch yet they chose to ignore skyscrapers.  In my opinion they are better off without it.  

Skyscrapers really started and boom in the U.S but in large part because the U.S doesn't have the same beautiful landscape that Europe has.  In general, Skyscrapers should only be build in places without beautiful natural landscape or with exception in developing country.  In the U.S, skyscrapers are build in the downtown district which is often ridden with homelessness.  

Another good example of this is the middle east such as UAE and Dubai which has no landscape other than desert.  Those skyscrapers make UAE and Dubai most more exciting to visit.  Remember tall buildings aren't skyscrapers until they are at minimal around 150 metres or 492 feets.  Tall buildings like the one you seen in Vegas are definitely not skyscrapers."

That being said, I don’t really like him. 

He is incredibly self loathing, speaking on his ills of being a person of his skin complexion and American ad nauseam. 

He gets way to overly unhappy with people who criticize him even politely in the comments (most prominent example that comes to mind was a few scientists correcting his pronunciation of anhydrous ammonia, and him trying to say there are several pronunciations). 

He talks from an authoritarian outlook while trying to maintain the “oh I’m not the expert” facade while in the very next breath speaking and acting like it.

In my family, dogs are the cause of so much drama like skirmishes (around kids) or planning around the dog because they have to go everywhere we go (like to the store and stuff). I even feel like my kids get left out of important time with loved ones because they get half the attention they normally would.

Some of them have titles such as ""I eat your face and turn you into soup"", ""The VSCO girl sits with you and turns you into one"" and these are only a few of the many more which have really weird narratives. I simply don't understand how people can watch these. I don't know whether they are ironic or not (at least after checking the first video it turns out not) but I find them mildly disturbing and annoying, especially because there's people even in the comments who fetishize them. It's probably only me though, idk lol."
SlipperyMinstrel,unpopularopinion,1620553920.0,Pop culture has made it infinitely at choosing nuclear energy as a clean energy source,"off my head i can name so many different games, movies and shows that depict nuclear power in a very bad way.

The Simpsons; Homer is a bumbling nuclear power plant worker in charge of a source of power at the time thought to be dangerous

Comic books: often you find a villain or even a hero radically and impossibly changed by nuclear energy into something destructive. Consider Dr Manhattan as a literal embodiment of the Manhattan project.

Fallout: A game set after a nuclear war, and though you could say the focus is not on the actual nuclear energy or anything like that, the choice to make it set in that way does impact how people feel.

Not to mention that Netflix series on Chernobyl.

As we approach a greater need for clean energy we seem to shun one of the cleanest we have. Its not perfect but trying to find perfection is costing us valuable time we can spend on using nuclear energy, and that time taken away from worrying about carbon emissions can go into creating better renewable solutions without fucking up our planet. None of these things show nuclear energy the way they do are inherently bad, but we need a shift from only viewing it as just Chernobyl, just nukes and see it as an honest way to fix our dilemmas.

ElenaPoleStar,unpopularopinion,1620510157.0,"I think children should be grown in artificial wombs, not birthed.","Being pregnant and giving birth pits an incredible tax on a woman’s body. Women often develop health problems as a result and sometimes die during labor (not as often nowadays) not to mention the pain and tearing of the pelvic region and caesarean section usually has even more complications. Women also get breast cancer often as a result of breastfeeding. I believe children should be grown in an artificial womb, it would still require sperm and an egg so they are not ‘cloned’. They should be given vegan mylk formula that provides dietary needs, growth hormones/accelerant, muscle stimulus and V.R learning (including seeing their parents and listening to their voices) so that when they leave the womb they are not helpless babies but around two or three years old (parents choice). They could then spend a year in some sort of rearing facility being taught physical and cognitive development. Their parent could visit them on weekends or when they are free and then finally bring home a four or five year old kid instead of a helpless infant. The gene in women that produces milk could be deactivated by genetic engineering as well as her ability to bear children .

Illustrious-Bass-783,unpopularopinion,1620465268.0,Meghan Markle might very well be lying.,"Piers Morgan was forced to resign because he refused to believe Meghan Markle's claims and had the balls to say so on national television. But considering that several of the claims have been disproved already, is Piers Morgan really in the wrong here? And if Meghan Markle lied about certain things during the interview with Oprah, why are people not open to the possibility that she could be lying about other things as well?

To look into some of her claims:

1. She said that she was 'naive' about the Royal Family and had no idea what she was getting into. Really? She dated Prince Harry for quite a while before they got married and for a good portion of that time, she actually lived with him, so she would have had a birds eye view of how the Royal Family functions. She has also claimed in the past that she did not know much about Prince Harry at the time of their first date, but several people have spoken out and said that Meghan Markle had been asking them about Harry long before that.
2. She said that Palace officials wanted to sweep her mental health problems under the carpet because it would be bad for the branding of the Royal Family. I find this incredibly difficult to believe. It is public knowledge that several high-profile members of the Royal Family have undergone therapy in the past, including Princess Margaret, Prince Charles and Prince Harry himself. So why would the Palace suddenly have a problem with Meghan Markle wanting help for her mental health? 
3. She lied about the 'secret wedding' that she and Prince Harry had three days before the televised Royal wedding. She claimed that they had a private ceremony with only the Archbishop of Canterbury in their backyard. The Archbishop has denied that such a thing ever happened. And the fact is, if it had indeed happened, it would have been illegal.
4. Archie not getting a title because of him being mixed race. This is another lie. Archie cannot legally get the title of 'Prince' because he is not in the line of succession. As simple as that. Seems like the Duchess of Sussex expects laws to be broken for her sake. 
5. Not being provided with security. Only certain members of the Royal Family are entitled to security that is paid for by British taxpayers. Others pay for their own security. 
6. Something relatively minor in comparison the the points mentioned above, but Meghan Markle claimed that her passport and driver's license had been taken away from her. Really? She has been seen driving around London several times- was she doing so illegally, without her license on her? What about all the extravagant private jet flights to exotic locations? She couldn't have done that without her passport. 

Considering that she has lied about all of this, how do we know that she has not lied about other things too? Her most sensational claim was that a certain member of the Royal Family expressed concern over what Archie's skin colour would be, but how do we know that she was not lying about that as well? 

It seems to me that Meghan Markle has created a complete narrative of victimhood and helplessness, and while the treatment given to her by British tabloids was abhorrent, she is definitely not as much of a victim as she paints herself to be. 

And finally, her hypocrisy disgusts me. She has gone out of her way to defame the Royal Family, and yet she expects the same family to continue giving her allowances, even though she is not a working royal anymore?

junkbox0,unpopularopinion,1620609566.0,Apps and websites that collect your information for advertising are good for you.,"There are a lot of people concerned about what information is collected about them and how it's used but what they forget is that data is what pays for the content they are consuming and keeps prices down. Let me explain. 

Nothing is free in this world, you know that. All those ""free"" BBQ recipes you look up tell advertisers you're into BBQ, that makes it cheaper for a hardware store to target you for their grill sale. Common sense says someone looking at BBQ content is more likely to buy a grill compared to someone looking at baby strollers. That website can sell their ad space at a premium saying they have the audience interested in BBQ and that pays for the ""free"" content you consumed. The hardware store can keep their advertising costs down by targeting the right people. If they have to target everyone not knowing what they're into, they'll have to spend more to make the sale. Guess who pays for that additional expense? You looking at BBQ content would probably appreciate seeing BBQ related ads instead of baby strollers, am I right? Oh, don't forget, without your data that website won't get a premium rate for that ad space, guess they'll have to cut expenses to keep it live. You know what that means. 

Do certain websites/apps abuse this data, yes. That goes with everything in life. Just don't forget all those times you saw an ad based on your online behavior and saw a great new product you had no idea existed. That's what it's for.

Yes, I work in the industry. No, I'm not worried about ios update, advertising is necessary and the industry will figure it out. Just going to cost everyone more than their browsing history."

The day has become very commercialized in this day and age. It has become more about showing the world how much you love your mum. And I am tired of it. It puts a lot of unnecessary pressure on everyone around, be it kids or dads or anyone else.


( Disclaimer- Geek language ahead, skip this paragraph if you don't want to read biology stuff)

Biologically speaking, in the simplest of terms, our genes just want to replicate themselves and want a best possible way to do so. Sometime during our evolutionary history, autosomes which certain sex determining regions stopped recombing and lead to the formation of sex chromosome ( If a fellow redditor wants to know more, go to Charlesworth, 1991). It gave certain specific skills to males and females of a species to help propogate their genetic material. In this deal, females got  genetic material required to grow another human inside them, they also got the instincts to look after the baby ( again for the survival of the species). So, I don't really want to commend half of a species for doing what nature them the ability to!

Now, coming to the social aspect of it ( I think it has been said time and time again), it's nice to be grateful that your mum took care of you, but do you really need mother's day to tell her how much you love them! Had mother's day not been thing, would you have been so ignorant to completely forget everything your mom did for you and act like a complete piece of shit. Apparently, now if you don't put a post on every social media about how much you love your mum and not get a gift, you are a shitty person ( not according to my mum's standards but according to the standards of society). Even, for mother's it brings a lot of undue pressure, with their worth in the family and society being judged by what their kids or husbands did for them. Most of the mothers I know, seriously just want some peace and quiet to themselves. I think the day might have started out as a decent effort, but now it is nothing more than pretentious posts , materialistic gifts and a picture with your mum on social media.

I could still wrap my head around wishing my mother and being grateful to her, but that's not enough, you have to go around wishing every mother that has ever existed on the face of this earth. If you like the day, celebrate it but please don't make it seem like the ultimate day of Redemption for everyone around you.

Re-do them Disney.,"Hard to believe that Padme chose the not-smooth-at-all, awkward sand hating, 5 year younger, obviously-most-insecure-""jedi"" in the ENTIRE star wars universe out of EVERY other character she met. Anakin: wannabe good guy master Jedi emotional lil boy that finally cracked after bottling up his emotions for 16 years.  God. Damn.
 

She could have picked obi wan, liam neeson, Samuel l jackson, or even fuccing darth maul.  They met once.  They could have exchanged glancing blows in a paralell universe then started making out lmfao. 

 I'm just trying to say that there are A LOT of inconsistencies between the movies and they go as deep down as padme choosing Anakin when in real life or even in fake life, no girl (excuse me, princess or whatever) ever is going to fall for a dude that carries a pocket pair up his sleeve. (""I hate sand"" - Darth Vader)

Anyways, yea george lucas wrote that shit up over a spring break or something.. Wth was he thinking?  The prequels were sooooo... Corny af.  For the kids I suspect.  But did george know that he threw away an oppurtunity to turn the starwars LEGACY into 3 EPIC, serious, R rated, kids would hate their parents for years for not letting them see it, movies.  

Think about it, what if you threw jar jar binks in the fuccing trash and started over from scratch. 

I say, STAR WARS: GAME OF THRONES edition.  Without all the sex but with all the blood and the fubar aspect about it.  Nitty gritty real life SHTF star wars type of prequels.  Babies getting lightsabered and Anakin has to watch his mom get brutally murdered by the sand people then he has to eat her brains after.  He later found out that obi wan knew where his mom was and didnt tell him.  And yoda knew too but still didnt tell him.  This leads to Anakin killing yodas favorite students real time over hologram across a galaxy or something.

Thing is, back in the earlier YouTube days, people loved his songs and didn't have a problem with the songs or music videos. Now you got people who are saying he can't play a romantic lead in his music videos when it's his videos.

His songs aren't amazing by any means but they aren't bad. Just because someone is cancelled doesn't mean the work they did is suddenly bad. 

If Eminem was suddenly cancelled, it would be odd to say his songs suddenly suck.

mariolucario493,unpopularopinion,1620609182.0,I think the grandmother in Coco got off too easy,"First of all, I'm not talking about Coco herself. She's perfect in every way. I'm talking about Elena, Coco's daughter, the one who enforces the ""no music"" rule with an iron chancla-wielding fist.

Also, spoilers for Coco ahead:

After rewatching Coco for the umpteenth time, I noticed one thing that really annoyed me about an otherwise amazing movie. I think that Abuelita Elena, the grandmother who forbids music, was too easily forgiven for emotionally abusing her grandson.

The whole Rivera family are kind of idiots for banning music in the first place just because of one ancestor's bad decision (Yeah, I know it wasn't his fault, but they don't know that). I get that the point of the movie is that the sins of your forefathers don't shape who you are (a great message for today's audience, btw), but I feel like the grandmother's arc is a little rushed.

Take for instance the scene where she smashes Miguel's guitar. Now in most Disney movies, when an overprotective family member lashes out at their child, (Little Mermaid, Brave, Mulan, etc.) they show at least some remorse for it afterwards. In Coco, the rest of the family appears horrified at this, but the grandmother seems to brush it off. The first thing she does afterwards is tell Miguel ""You'll feel better after you eat."" It honestly comes off as some type of cult-like conditioning, and I would call CPS if I saw that.

Now I know that a lot of traditional Mexican families tend to put emphasis on ""family comes first no matter what"". As for me, a whiter-than-white American, I am of the mind that respect for one's elders should not be automatic. I believe that it is important to love and support your family, but we should understand that sometimes the people closest to us might not always have all the answers. And that seems to be a belief that is becoming more and more popular every day.

Now to be fair, the point of the movie is that family love should be unconditional, and it is made very clear that the grandmother is in the wrong. I don't mind that. What I am a little annoyed by is how quickly she undergoes a change of heart at the end of the movie.

I'm not really a fan of rushed redemption scenes. I think if you want to redeem an antagonist, you need to do it with a lot of care and take the time to make the character sympathetic. Zuko from ATLA is one of the best redemption arcs in fiction for this very reason. In Coco, however, the grandmother just sheds some tears of joy at the end, and then we cut to a year later where everything has been resolved. I'm sure there was probably a lot of emotional turmoil she went through in that one year as she tried to regain her grandson's trust, but I'm disappointed we didn't see any of it. I know it's meant to be mainly Miguel's story, but she isn't even shown apologizing or anything.

My only guess as to why it was so rushed is because it would probably come off as a repeat of Imelda's (the matriarch of the dead relatives) arc, and the filmmakers didn't want to be redundant by having two characters learn the same lesson. But other than that one nitpick, I still think Coco is one of Pixar's best movies. Though I have to ask; if the whole point of the movie is that family bonds are more important than fame and glory, why does the Land of the Dead still put the family-ditching celebrities at the top of the social hierarchy?"
heckdoggo111111,unpopularopinion,1620579873.0,18 years is not sufficient to be considered an adult,"Through Covid, I’ve realized more and more that being 18 is not enough. I’m completely helpless on my own and many other “adults” feel the same way. 

The brain doesn’t fully develop until 25. We’re not biologically adults until 25... and even then, kids need help from their parents. 

I HATE to see adults say, “only 18 years more of this” and abandon their children immediately after they turn 18. Parenthood is a lifetime commitment. Kids did not choose to exist; their parents are to “blame” for their existence. Kids being kicked out of the home right after turning 18 is devastating. Think about who you were as an 18 year old. Odds were that you needed your parents. 

Especially on Mother’s Day (and Father’s Day coming up), it’s important to address this. Don’t you want your kid to wish you a “happy Mother’s Day” every year? Your parenting duties don’t end the day your kid turns 18. I’m so lucky to have parents and a home to come back to. Unfortunately, many others can’t say the same.

during the US revolution, the british were pre-occupied and abandoned the east falklands, and now all of the islands were under full spanish control, although the british continued to claim the entire islands.

in the 1810s, spain was now facing colonial revolutions and so they abandoned the falklands. but they continued to claim the entirety of the islands as well.

Argentina inherits the Spanish claim to the islands upon independence, and seeks to resettle this, but it's difficult. they succeed in 1828. Argentina seizes 3 US ships for disobeying argentine fishing laws. The US, which argues that the falklands don't belong to anyone, send a warship and dismantle the government.

Argentina sends a new governor to the island but he is killed in a mutiny. The british then return to the island for the first time in 60 years, and sieze control over the entirety of the islands.

note: spain and france were both controlled by the house of bourbon, and had a shared foreign policy. Spain had always considered the islands to be theirs, due to the treaty of tordasillas. a french explorer claimed the islands for france and created a settlment, but france almost immediately handed over the settlement to the spanish due to the preexisting spanish claim."

So, usually when a dog comes jumping on me, or just keep around me expecting for some attention, I most of time ignore them until they go away. If somehow I can convince myself that the dog is clean enough, I may pet it. If I know that I'll have somewhere to wash my hands properly after touching it, I may pet it.

schizonipple,unpopularopinion,1620495460.0,The majority of redditors have irrational health anxiety,"A lot of the concerns and worries they have about certain things are technically true, but I'm so sick of seeing people on this site exaggerate the smallest things and acting like you will cause permanent damage or even die if you do something harmful once in a while and won't wrap yourself in bubble plastic. You have a little wound on your leg and you aren't changing the bandages and disinfecting the wound every 3 hours and 34 minutes? You're at high risk of getting a deadly infection and dying. You have a weird pimple looking thing on your chin? It could potentially be a life threatening tumour and you should see a doctor just to be sure. You took 1 Tylenol pill and drank a few beers? The combination between both of these things can be deadly, cause you to overdose, or cause permanent liver damage. You had something slightly traumatic happen in your life? You should immediately see a therapist just to make sure you're ok and help you process the situation (you apparently don't have the ability to process and deal with bad things happening in your life on your own). All of these things are real possibilities and dangers but they are very small things and not following conventional internet health advice to the t won't magically kill you. Unneeded and irrational anxiety when it comes to your health is more harmful to your health than popping 1 Tylenol and drinking a few beers once in the blue moon or smoking 1 cigarette. Reddit can feel like those medical blog posts written by white suburban soccer moms where they act like one scratch or bump on you can be potentially deadly sometimes. Unless you are severely immuno compromised or severely unhealthy little things like taking one Ibuprofen on an empty stomach won't cause any real damage or potentially kill you. I think the fact that reddit is an American dominated site plays a role too because the attitude towards these things in Europe differs vastly."

Yes, if you were born white, middle class, in the US (and avoided being one of the 2.2M soldiers drafted to fight in Vietnam) then chances are you had it pretty easy. If you were just about anyone else, life is significantly better today.

Today, there is less poverty, less starvation, more education, less censorship, more class mobility, and more access to life saving healthcare than ever before. 

People try to point out that college and housing prices are more expensive than in the 60s, of course they were, we didn’t let minorities get home loans or go to college! 

People try to argue that everyone deserves to live a middle class lifestyle just because they can breathe and tie their own shoes. What happened to the idea that owning a home or having a degree or a career was something to be achieved instead of a universal right? What happened to the understanding that it took sacrifice, either yours or your parents, to be lucky enough to be middle class, and that you shouldn’t take that for granted.

And it goes without saying that there just aren’t enough resources globally for everyone to have live American middle class. Hell, people living on the poverty line in the US today have it better than 50% of the world.

Rumle1708,unpopularopinion,1620600746.0,Touchscreens are horrible and unnecessary.,"I truly believe touchscreens are one of the most overrated technologies. Not that normal people talk a lot about, but tech companies implement them in everything and 90% of the time it is just annoying and unnecessary. 

First of all, yes touchscreens on mobile phones, tablets and similar devices are great! That is because a mobile phone is not made for 4-5 different purposes, where you could just have 4-5 buttons. Phones have thousands of possible button configurations due to their versatility. Also they usually have a touchscreen of high quality that feels responsive. 

However I’m starting to see more and more products with touchscreens built in. This could for example be a stove. There is absolutely no reason to have a touchscreen on a stove. And the touchscreens on devices like this are the cheapest of its kind. They are not responsive at all and you have press the button 3 or 4 times before anything happens and usually with a lot of force. The lack of response means no user feedback which is very important in product design. Take a button for example you have a nice click that lets you know the button has been pressed or a dial/knob have some resistance that lets you know the knob is turning. That means you have to put all your attention to the touchscreen if you want to operate it, which is unfavourable on a stove or in a car. A knob on a stove can easily be operated without the user paying full attention. Also a touchscreen doesn’t work when having wet fingers or gloves, which often the case when near a stove.

TLDR; Touchscreens most products are annoying due to unresponsiveness and no user feedback."

That's okay. To me watching porn is a deal-breaker because of the unethical practices within the porn industry and because of the misogynistic, racist, and ephebophilic themes that mainstream porn has. Personally, I think it creates toxic ideals around sex and I don't think I'd be compatible with someone who is okay with consuming unethical pornography which most free porn is. 

Establishing boundaries within a relationship is important and what some people are cool with others aren't. It's about communication, but I realize how often women are hailed as hysterical for not wanting their partners to watch porn"
2-_-8,unpopularopinion,1620533324.0,Treating one's mental illness as if it's another person is annoying and unhelpful,"I see this quite often on social media, but also sometimes in person (in the few times that I've met others with these disorders and talked about them, ha), mainly in the eating disorder and OCD communities. People go so far as to call their anorexia 'Ana' and say things like 'Ana wanted me not to eat X but I'm gonna do it anyways! Ana is such a bully', and similar things where they personify anorexia or whatever eating disorder they may have. Similarly for OCD, I often see people giving other people advice like 'That's not what you're really thinking, that's just what OCD is trying to make you believe', or 'This is just OCD wants; don't let OCD win.'

I find this frustrating and quite irritating, honestly. It seems like a form of toxic positivity to me, but judging from the volume of these types of posts, most people would disagree. It's not so simple to just completely separate a mental illness from yourself, and you can't just automatically blame all of your negative thoughts on this illness. That feels like they're just trying to avoid taking responsibility for their own thoughts by saying 'No, that's Ana, not me'. I used to lurk in various eating disorder and OCD communities, hoping to see others' experiences that are similar to my own and to feel a bit less alone, but instead I constantly see these posts or replies to posts where people just say 'Don't worry, that's just OCD, not you!', and it feels quite alienating because I really don't see how that can be helpful to most people. I find it very hard to believe that so many people are really able to accurately classify their thoughts as being 'theirs' or their mental illness'. In my experience, a mental illness is quite intertwined with your personality, so this comes off as fake to me. My mental illnesses are a part of me and always will be, although hopefully they will eventually become a much smaller part of me, and I can't possibly be the only one who sees it that way, contrary to what these posts would imply.

These types of posts/comments/etc are so irritating to me that I've stopped trying to find any sort of community for support, because all I can find are those useless kinds of statements. They seem like the kind of thing that only someone completely recovered or someone faking positivity when really they are struggling in their recovery would say, and it is extremely unhelpful for someone who is trying to recover and doesn't have that privilege of being able to differentiate their mental illness from themself."

koolkammy,unpopularopinion,1620527128.0,Getting news from Twitter is perfectly fine.,"Getting news from Twitter is perfectly fine if you're just discovering something. What separates idiots from educated folks is that educated folks will see something trending on Twitter and will EXIT the app to research it. Twitter idiots just read any tweet or headline and run with it. During the election time, there was a feature implemented where if you tried to retweet something without opening the link attached, a message would pop up saying ""are you sure you want to post this tweet without opening the associated link"". That was the smartest thing to do on Twitter's behalf because it encouraged people to actually read the articles they were boosting.  Everyone gets their news from somewhere, but it's vital that you actually research what you're talking about. It's easier to type something into Google and find reputable sources than it is to apologize publicly after misinterpreting a situation or spreading false information. Twitter has also hired a team of fact checkers and heavily moderates their trending news stories tabs to help prevent the spread of false information.

It's okay to first hear about a situation on a social media platform, but don't start climbing onto your soapbox just because user366127 has a tweet with 20K likes that says the world is ending."
Killer_Queen1999,unpopularopinion,1620483908.0,Pokémon should never say their names.,"Like many children I grew up with the Pokémon games and the anime. The anime Pokémon always say their names. You could make the argument that in the anime all Pokémon are named after what they say. 

Back in the days I always wanted the Pokémon from the games to say their names like in the anime. However in recent years I started to hate this idea. 

The games are obviously for children but Pokémon has a surprising big lore. Pokémon or actual animals or monsters. Pokédex entries mentioned dark themes pretty often and I like the fact that these adult themes are still in the games to this day. 

I can totally see Pokémon games where every Pokémon says its name with no interessiert lore or adult theme to be seen. 

I still see so many people who want the Pokémon to say their names in the games even though they are suppose to be animals and the recent release of New Pokémon Snap proved that. Though I haven't seen many people say this I saw some people say that they would have liked to see the Pokémon say their names just like in the anime. For me that would have destroyed the amazing atmosphere (Pokémon Snap is the best Pokémon game since Black and White 2 fight me). Pokémon are just suppose to sound like the animal they're based on. This is just how it is. 


I think the anime toned down the Pokémon name crys quite heavely in recent years and that's a good thing. Still I see many people who want them to say their names. The only exception I like is Pikachu. Pikachu's voice actress is so iconic that I always smile when I hear her. Even in the games and Pokémon Snap"

The feeling that you were blessed to be born in a country where you don’t have to deal with what these people are dealing with is great. I feel grateful to be alive. I remember back in 2018, I felt pretty depressed about my life in general and I took a trip to Nepal for a month. It was a game changer. All the poor people there made me realize how lucky I’m. I felt like I was better than them for some odd reason. I especially loved giving out chump change to the mass of beggars that would surround me. I felt like Jesus. I plan on a next trip to Nepal."

pikablob,unpopularopinion,1620573262.0,"""Aerated"" tap water sucks","I'm talking about taps that, instead of a stream of nice pure water, spit out bubbly foam at low pressure; it seems every modern tap does this and I'm honestly sick of it. Apparently it's about saving water, but all it does is make tap water just worse enough to use that it becomes annoying. If I'm using a tap in my house, I'm either washing something or I'm getting a drink; I don't want a head of foam in my glass of water, and it means the glass (or, more often bottle) I'm filling up will overflow before it's actually full thanks to the foam - a minor annoyance, but one that gets on my nerves when it's constant. It's even worse trying to drink directly from an aerated tap (yes, I do that - why should I bother getting a glass at 2am when I can just drink faster direct from the tap?). And if I'm trying to wash stuff off, having decent water pressure out of the tap makes scrubbing encrusted food or w/e off plates much easier. It's not a huge thing, but having foam coming out of a tap just makes it mildly more annoying to use with no decent benefit."
Nuewim,unpopularopinion,1620595356.0,"It is mostly parents fault that they never teached kids their skills, music/movie taste/job etc.","Many people complain their kids have no idea about do It yourself/repairing, cooking, that kids don't wants to have the same job as them or that they don' like the same music. 

But they never actually introduced kids to those  things. You can't just complain  to someone that is already 16/18 or 20 years old, it is too late. You need teach them when they are few years old, not in late teens. 


If you can repair everything at home, but you never even once tried to share knowledge or teach kid how to use screwdriver what you expect? They will be unable to repair anything in adult life. If you make  sandwiches for some who is 16/18, they won't magically learn how to cook after they move out. They will have 0 cooking skills. And it took years to develop good cooking skills. If you love 80's music, but never listen to it, then how your kids can appreciate it, if they have no idea about it? Or you have some job. How do you want  kids to do the same, if they have zero knowledge about what you are doing. You are for example architect, but your kids can't even draw or can't do math... Or you are graphic designer/programmer, and your kids have no idea how to use computer. Advising them to follow your footsteps  after they graduate high school is crazy tyranny. If you want something like that you should introduce them to your job when they were in primary school. Then they would have a real choice and maybe they will follow you. For example most musicans kids do it, with their own free will. Why? Cause they whole childhood experienced music at home, it is natural for them and they want do it. Most doctors on the other hand never teached kids anything about health/medicine, not even first aid. 

I am not saying kids will hear parents, learn everything and be the same as them. No. But if parents never even tried, their kids will be basically allien people for them. They will have nothing in common. Most parents ( no matter rich or poor) actually teach kids almost nothing. School, internet and ""street"" raise those kids."

Keeping them alive while they suffer both physically and mentally, full non stop until the day they're gone. You are doing nothing but making them suffer, which is ironic because it would be better if they're dead resting in peace than being alive suffering. It really upsets me. Another reason could be that depressed people, whi will live depressed all their life (ACTUAL DEPRESSION, NOT ""I'M SAD"") and that's not a quality life. Let people decide what they want to do with their own life. IT'S THEIR OWN LIFE. If someone wants to be gone, why you stip them? They haev their reasons just like me. Let people rest in peace. If you complain that ""this person has killed himself/herself/themself/xemself"" then why didn't you try to help? The hyopcrysy. Eithanasia should be enforce because people shouldn't be forced to live if they are REALLY suffeering every single day. Please stop the pain, can't take it anymore. Send help, anything. People call me crazy, but it makes sense that if you want peace, it can be outside this stupid and hurtful anthipathetic people have created. Either respect everyone, be kind, share, include people, or don't complain if someone killed himself/herself/themself/xemself because was bullied or suffered enough for discrimination/physical pain/mental sickness/being old.

Magazine advice columnists wouldn't last long if they replied ""just leave"" to every question. This seems to be even more prevalent if there are kids involved. ""Leave for the sake of the kids"". NO I am not going to leave my long term relationship with children because I have one problem with my partner and we bicker! What sort of message is that to kids? As soon as things get a little tough, you should just bail. Don't seek other solutions. Just bail it's the right thing to do. 


Obviously this is different for cases of extreme mental/physical abuse, or persistent daily fighting with no fix. But one issue out of 1000 other good qualities? Hell no, I am going to work on my relationship! I just need some guidance because I don't have a lot of friends I can talk to, so sadly fell back on internet strangers. 


Never again. It sucks to reach out for advice and instead receive judgement, be made to feel like I'm a bad role model to my kids and being stupid for wanting to stay.

Then whyyy do they all think its so unique to suddenly delete everything they've ever uploaded on Instagram for example, go quiet for a little while then release something and everyone's like ""Wow, how unexpected"". Its cringey to me. It doesn't make your new music give your ""return"" any more impact or suggest you've changed/improved etc. It just shows such an insecurity of your fear over relevancy; that you feel the need to erase what you had to spark mystery for whats next when we all know what's going to happen."

AnonPinkLady,unpopularopinion,1620509384.0,Piercings are way better than tattoos in almost every way,"1. A regrettable piercing is way easier to hide or get rid of. Other than gages, most piercings are virtually invisible when you remove the jewelry itself and look just like a small freckle. Especially well cared for healthy ones that heal properly.

2. They age SO much better. As long as you wear light jewelry they often age well and change very little in aesthetic appearance over the years. Meanwhile almost all tattoos fade to a greenish or purplish color and eventually become blurry and hard to distinguish. 

3. They're faster to get done. Good tattoos take hours, and can be pretty painful. Most piercings are immediate and the pain is very brief.

4. You can change it up. Tattoos are the color and style they are, forever. You can get a cover up but that is just as challenging and painful as getting a tattoo all over again and eventually you wont be able to go over it again and it will become a black blob. Your colored tattoos will clash with certain outfits and just wont work for certain looks. Piercings can easily be switched out for different jewelry whenever you want once they're healed, for any color theme or style.

5. They can send a message or be completely aesthetic and represent nothing at all. Most tattoos have to reference something and generally arent just for aesthetic purposes due to the nature of the artform. You can get a meaningful piece of body jewelry or you can just sport something shiny

Overall I think they're just the more superior body mod. I'm not anti-tattoo though I just dont understand wht piercings are considered more taboo. They're seriously underrated"

sonofgreedandlust,unpopularopinion,1620630907.0,I believe you can make a movie like blazing saddles today,"I always hear you can't make a movie like blazing saddles or whatever like that anymore but I think you absolutely can and I'll be honest I think it'll do pretty well the reason why I think it would do well is because I think it would be breath of fresh air. This might just be me but for a while now everything kind of just feels kind of bland and samey from movies and tv shows/cartoons to video games and music for example I've always like animation and comics I loved shows like Beavis and Butthead, Courage, Power Puff Girls, Totally Spies, Billy and Mandy, FLCL, ATHF, Ed Edd n Eddy, South Park, Drawn Together, The Boondocks, Super Jail, Celebrity Death Match and comics like Spawn, Spider man, X-men, Hell boy, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. I stopped watching cartoons except for adult swim and south park around 2015 and I stopped reading comics way before that like 2008 so I decided to try watching/reading some of the newer stuff and my god most of them are bland and boring a lot of them have similar designs and some off the most milquetoast ""plots"" I've ever seen.

I get why they are most likely like this easier and cheaper to create and animate and to cast a bigger net for a wider reach of audience but none of it feels like something someone wanted to create but something board members wanted to create like a lot of it feels like it's boxes getting checked than a story or just something someone wanted to create but I recently watched invincible even though it's a super hero show which I'll be honest I'm kind of tired of super hero's but I really liked it. I think we have been in a risk taking drought for a while now what I mean is everything is already known brands which isn't bad but the people making the stuff already know people are going to watch the newest Marvel/DC/Star Wars/Disney/Pixar movie they already know that people will watch the newest reboot/sequel to whatever movie came out 10-20 years ago so they don't really have to try to as hard as someone making a brand new movie. So for the past I don't know 5-6 years or so everything to me has just been feeling very mediocre not bad but not good either majority of things have just been kind of a big meh to me and cause of this I think if someone was to release a movie like Blazing Saddles, American pie, Friday, Harold and Kumar, Cheech and Chong, Demolition Man today I think it would work and be profitable because it would be different to what's been coming out for last few years this also goes for everything else I mentioned if they decided that they want to be edgy and take inspiration from the stuff from late 2000s-how ever far back I really do think it would work. 

Will there be people who get pissed off and people who will ride the hate wagon because they saw someone else usually someone they like was pissed off about it of course that's unpreventable especially nowadays when people are looking to be mad about anything but if they don't care what these people think they can't really hurt them in any way other than being mad at them. For example look at people like Trey Parker and Matt Stone, Patrice O'neal, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Eminem, NWA, Snoop Dogg, Black Sabbath, The Misfits, Elvis, Johnny Cash, Tyler the creator and a lot more people have all had people get mad/offended because of what they did or said if they listened or cared about what those people thought we more than likely wouldn't have some of their best works. I think people should go back to stop trying to be for everyone and stop trying not to offend someone because while it is a nice and noble goal not to offended anyone it's also impossible not to offend at least 1 person or a group of people plus I think the people who aren't afraid to offend people often make the best stuff and I think that's because they are more willing to take risk's that majority people won't."

svbman,unpopularopinion,1620529191.0,Kids do NOT owe their parents respect simply because their parents provided for them.,"It annoys me when parents play the ""I fed you, put clothes on your back, kept a roof over your head, etc"" card to demand respect from their children. It annoys me, even more, when people thank their parents for doing so. It would be like me thanking a taxi driver for not purposefully running the taxi off a bridge and into a river. 

It doesn't make any sense. Parents are **legally and morally compelled** to provide for their children. Putting clothes on their back and feeding them is the absolute minimum expectation. Any less, and you'd be guilty of indictable parental abandonment. It pisses me off when parents think that providing for their children (food, clothing, shelter, etc.) makes them good parents deserving of respect. Parents deserve respect for loving and supporting their children. 

Your kid doesn't owe you respect because you gave them clothes and didn't starve them. Congratulations, you're a law-abiding citizen. You honoured the contract of childbirth.

Do I go around demanding respect because I haven't committed tax fraud yet? Of course not.  But it would not be dissimilar to parents demanding respect because they fulfilled their children's basic survival needs."

tumamafea,unpopularopinion,1620501548.0,Military retirees who do 20+ years of service who are getting their DOD retiree pensions and upon separation showed up to be in nearly perfect health and later on apply for VA pension are gaming the system.,"Military people who do 20+ of service and get their regular retirement plus their retiree pension should not apply for VA benefits on most cases. Younger folks with less time in service who really got damaged should be a priority over the ones who did so many years and are just aging.

I see a lot of older veterans who have decades of military service and did 20+ of service just fine and then apply for VA compensation and use as service connected issues things are normally parts of the human aging process.  This has to be under more scrutiny.


This program should be mainly used for the younger people who really get injured in mad ways whose future earnings in either the public or private sector would be hindered due to their now debilitating health.  Not for schmos who were capable to have a good chunk of an active work life in perfect health and are using as disabilities conditions that are mere parts of the human aging process.  Many of these conditions either are nowhere listed on their medical records, were never an issue upon release of active duty (the military does a separation physical), or they show up later in life. I’m mainly talking about physical ailments in here, btw.  Now for PTSD: there are two main causes; combat and sexual assaults.  Usually, for these two, mere psychological evaluations are not normally enough.  In the past years, the VA has been requesting things like buddy statements, some sort of any existence of any possible examination that matches the dates of event (if it was a sexual assault), second and third opinions from outside providers, and other more solid evidence (not every single one of these, but more than one at least).  There are other lesser known causes for PTSD, and the same also applies.  


It’s still a somewhat broken system, but I’d say this would be a step in the right direction to fix it.  Limiting the amount of older people who get these benefits.  The VA should focus more on the younger folks who are losing useful working years due to loss of health, not older folks who managed to spend years in good health and are suddenly using their aging connected arthritis as a service connected issue."

MaybeSecondBestMan,unpopularopinion,1620594236.0,“Dark/gritty/realistic” superhero media is 95% obscene drivel.,"I just finished the first episode of Invincible and I’m honestly repulsed. I’m entirely sick of this genre of superhero media that rehashes the same boring premise: “But what if superheroes were like, realistic, bro?”

They’re all the same and they completely miss the point of superheroes. Stuff like Invincible and The Boys is built on shock and excessive gore, and it seems designed almost exclusively for teenage boys with attitude problems. A lot of it borders on grotesque and to me feels like a total perversion of superheroes in general. 

Superheroes are supposed to be aspirational. They’re our pop culture moral compass. I want to be inspired by their restraint and selflessness, and awed by their strength and ingenuity. I don’t want to watch a bargain brand Superman take dollar store Wonder Woman by the hair and turn her head around until she vomits blood all over her own back. That’s disgusting and offensive, and that describes a lot of this genre. The vast majority of these stories are shallow, obscene, and almost never as clever as they think they are. 

Alan Moore did it well with Watchmen, and that story still deserves to be celebrated today. But a lot of the creatives who followed in his footsteps just ended up making a bunch of cynical, ultra violent garbage that feels like the product of a society that’s lost its way. I legitimately don’t want to meet the kind of person who thinks this is quality entertainment."

Simon is like “I got some vengeance thing against my dad and I don’t want kids. Fuck adoption tho”

And Daphne wants kids.

So instead of having a conversation when Daphne finds out that she misinterpreted ‘I cannot have children’. She rapes him. Gaslights him and says it’s his fault that she raped him. Then she got mad at him a few days later because he did not want to have sex with her. She gaslights him again. Then she gets mad at him because she wasn’t pregnant from the fucking rape.

Then she turned into a cold hearted bitch until the end where they have a conversation and Daphne goes “I accept that you don’t want kids”

Jesus christ she was a horrible person. All I hear is how innocent she was. She’s horrible and nasty. Simon is a bit immature but I don’t blame him for that shit.

FlameSamurai63,unpopularopinion,1620491118.0,Parents shouldn't have any input when it comes to a sport that their child is participating in.,"My little sister's volleyball season came to an end, and her team has a losing record. One particular thing I hated about this season was how the parents of more than half of the girls on the team demanded that their child play in more games, even though they clearly have no interest in improving or playing. 

The coach eventually gave in. The better players (such as my sister) sat on the bench quite often, and the lazy girls were put out on the court and practically did nothing to help the team win. 

My sister is one of the few girls on the team that cares about improving. Most of her other teammates just stand around at practice, goofing around and doing TikTok dances. The parents of these girls don't show up to practice to watch their daughters, and yet they demand that their child gets more play time in tournaments. 

It baffles me when parents like this sign their daughters up for things like volleyball when they have no intent of helping their child improve. It makes me even more upset whenever they demand to let their kids play when they don't even try to work hard at practice. I think that parents shouldn't have any input in a sport that their kid is playing because crap like thus happens."

graysond,unpopularopinion,1620596696.0,"Disc Golf involves too much luck to be a ""sport""","First off, I know this is an unpopular opinion because of some of the angry blowback I have received sharing it elsewhere. The reason I hold this opinion is that there is  way too much randomness in the flight of the disc's themselves. While one can get better at throwing, there is never full control over an entire throw and there is a great deal of luck in the mix. Any random gust of wind can highly alter a throw and if the disc lands and rolls its all luck if you get a favorable roll, absolutely nothing to do with talent. I like to refer to discus, which is a sport that I have experience with. Due to the weight of the disc and the way in which the trajectory, flight and even landing is based on a good release and technique, its a sport. This however, is not the story with a disc used in disc golf. The weight allows for vast alteration of any throw due to wind patterns, which can vary at different altitude the disc is traveling through. This can highly alter the distance, stability of the disc, weather the flight path is straight or curves, and how the disc itself lands resulting in either a smooth skip or a roll. There are too many random variables in the flight of a disc in disc golf to be considered a sport."

However, in any other game it just either serves to annoy the player or to stress them out. 
  
For example, in Animal Crossing: New Horizon I really hate the crafting mechanic as it feels to pad out the game with unnecessary junk that you may eventually need and cause you to constantly lose tools and constantly be forced to rebuild or rebuy them.
  
Then in other games you have to craft ammo or healing items, I just don't like this cuz then it always has an extremely restrictive inventory system so that I have to constantly stress about what I need and what I can spare to craft item A or what I can toss to hold item B.

I'm really happy to be honest that Breath of the Wild doesn't have a full on crafting system, I liked just finding new weapons and not worrying about having to find unnecessary junk to combine into weapons or ammo."

But then when ya get to movies like Anchorman, Zoolander or Step Brothers, too much goddamn ferrell (Zoolander was sorta on the cusp but i feel like he got just a little too much screen time, had they cut a few minutes of him out it wouldve been a much stronger movie). The guys usual characters are awkward, annoying, hard to watch, painfully unfunny (pretty much like the entire film Napoleon Dynamite, which ironically he isnt in, dunno why, that woulda been perfect for him, but i digress).

leaguegoderino,unpopularopinion,1620508128.0,Talent shows like America’s Got Talent and anything similar are immoral and dystopic the more you think about them.,"Let me start off by saying that this isn’t a completely original thought. I re-watched the black mirror episode “15 million merits” recently and ruminated on the prospect of talent shows a bit. I recommend watching this episode to anyone who’s curious about societies ailments today. It’s unsettling watching it and comparing it to our reality. Anyways, here goes nothing.

First off, the premise of talent shows are sinister. You have a few very wealthy and famous individuals who judge and dangle that same wealth and fame in front of you. It’s a power imbalance where they have all the control. It only upholds itself on a false premise that the contestants one day can become rich and famous too. Most of the contestants on the show don’t achieve that, not because they’re not talented, but because they weren’t fortunate. Also, there’s barely any people who got their starts from these kinds of shows. Even when they win or make it very far. I know there’s a few, but it’s very much the exception and not the rule. 

Another thing is the psychological warfare that goes on. The judges can be as rude as they want and the audience will always side with them because of the power imbalance shown above. It’s in humane and very classist. People in the audience who are working 9-5, some just barely getting by are supporting this? Sounds backwards to me.

Yukariioi,unpopularopinion,1620443729.0,IzuOcha isn’t a great ship despite it being Canon.,"

I know I’m going to get nailed for this, but please hear me out.

Izuocha isn’t a bad ship, however it sadly falls into the category of a ship which had potential to grow, but for obvious reasons it didn’t.

To start it off it is a very rushed ship. Even though they are technically not together yet Horikoshi definitely rushed an opportunity to make their relationship together grow like in the way he did with Izuku and Bakugou.

Unfortunately, this ship falls in the category of a overuse shounen anime trope. For example, the nice and kind typical anime school girl who supports the main protagonist throughout his journey, yet at the same time has little to no importance other than being a love interest to him.

It’s canon, but in my opinion very predictable and not original.

Uraraka Ochako isn’t completely a typical anime girl. She is smart, determined, and strong, however do to how her character in a whole is being handled she just faded into the background. Nothing plain about her, but just is a character who doesn’t stand out much even when the spotlight is on her.
 
Technically speaking she does have some Character development, but it is so subtle it’s not really enough to be acknowledge. 

The ship overall is good, but not anything new. In a way kind of plain do to the lack of actual character development between the two, and as I said before overusing character themes. 

Overly blushing and stammering when someone mentions one of them can get a bit to much from time to time. One of the best ways to develop a character is to have interactions with the two characters, but as the series goes on their interactions get less.. and less... and.. yeah.

There wasn’t even enough discussion with the two when Uraraka all of a sudden confessed she may have a crush on Izuku back in season 3. In my opinion this was way to early to be developing this type of feelings. I feel like it should’ve been put of until later in the series like in season 5. 

It’s like the two don’t even talk anymore, and when they do it almost always has something to do with school, work, exams, training, e.t.c.
 
I am aware that since it is a shounen anime it will not have many romance happening, however when it does in this anime it is filled with useless pinning, and constant tropes.

I am not trying to bash or go after Horikoshi for doing things that particular way, he is a great manga creator, but he could’ve given a little more thought into creating a different situation for the two instead of going with the cliché scenarios used by hundreds of animes. 

That being said I hope you understand my perspective, and have a great day!"

AConcernedTaxpayer,unpopularopinion,1620436254.0,The pear is NOT a pretentious fruit,"It goes without saying that the pear is one of the most, if not THE most, stigmatized fruit out there. As such, people will usually judge you for buying pears and assume your intentions for doing so are shallow. Though few people might actually do it just to show off their wealth or establish dominance in the fresh fruits aisle, I think it's fair to say that most just like pears. And so, how is it fair to treat us like that, and more importantly, is there some basis to that stigma?

The underlying principle is that particularly expensive food items are not usually considered essentials, even though they fulfill a basic need. Since you don't specifically need them, they instead fall in a different class of product broadly known as luxuries. Then obviously, the economics of it causes a perception biais towards the people that can actually afford it, and the whole thing is fueled by a cycle of envy. Here's the thing though, I don't think this applies here, because the price is actually fair. In fact, pears usually sells for about the same price as apples, which means the only two cheaper fruits are bananas and oranges. Furthermore, it is widely available, and so it doesn't make sense to include it in the slightly uncommon fruit category along with kiwi and whatnot. It is not even an imported products in most countries, thanks to its forgiving growing requirements. And for these reasons, I think it is a highly misunderstood fruit. I strongly believe that the pear is actually a humble working-class fruit perfectly suitable for middle income families. Anyway, just my two cents, thanks for reading."

I am actually concerned because people are putting stupid amounts of money into this, without realising that there is no fundamental problem that Dogecoin was created to solve, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum. It was created as a joke and should be treated as such. Many finance YouTubers are aggressively covering it on their channels and their Instagram, without realising that it is causing people with not a lot of money to take notice and invest money into it, money that they cannot afford to lose.

Back in the good old days if I misspelled a word, it would have a red line under it, telling you to go fix it. Annoying but safe.

Now if I misspell a word, it fixes it, great except in many cases I have no idea it happened and I'll keep making the mistake and one day auto correct won't be there to save me like on paper or a whiteboard.

It's not so bad on a phone since you can see the change in word happen in real time. The movement makes you look at it and notice.
On a computer (espically if you aren't good at typing or unfamiliar with the keyboard in case you use multiple devices) it's very easy to miss.

It's really bad when you spelled it correctly (maybe a name) and the genius computer changes it a commonly used word with similar spelling. It pats itself on the back and doesn't even show that it made a change without your explicit input.

I don’t really buy into it. The British empire had curbed slavery in their territories (I know the still did really evil shit but they did a bit less of it) whereas slavery was rampant in America. Also, the argument that the colonists wanted “representation” is kinda BS cause only a fraction of them would actually get it (property holding men). The British just wanted tax revenue back for the war they just fought to defend the colonies. The brits weren’t the good guys either obviously, but I think it’s a tad naive to think the colonists were the objectively good side. It’s just two groups of people fighting, there wasn’t a clearly good moral side like in WW2 or the US civil war.

On the aggressively pro-choice side, I fear that the woman is likely to go and get an abortion because she just doesn't want children, and not seek my input or advice because ""it's my body and I don't have to ask your permission etc."" and that's not something I'd accept in a partner.

On the aggressively pro-life side, I fear that the woman is likely to carry a baby to term while risking her own health, which would leave me as a grieving single father; OR she'd carry a baby with a genetic defect to term instead of terminating and I personally can't handle the idea of having a severely disabled child, but I'm not the type to run off, so I'd spend the rest of my life taking care of a disabled child I don't want and being miserable.

I'm 39, and mental illness in the 80's and 90's was very rarely seen. Either A) People were misdiagnosed in the past, B) It was swept under the rug, or C) My favored opinion, more and more children through young adults are interacting mostly online, and not learning deal with the stress of interacting in person.

I worked in an ER for 4 years, and in drug rehab for 1 year, so it's safe to say that I've seen literally thousands of psych patients throughout the years.

I've come to the conclusion that with the technology of today, it is much easier for teens and young adults to shut themselves in, and only interact via social media and text messaging. This is all before the pandemic, so I won't use that as a factor. My theory is that these people who shut themselves in and don't interact in person as people did before the internet was a thing, greatly deprive themselves of building the social skills needed to cope with stress. The stress that comes from problem solving in person scenarios that can happen on a whim. These people aren't able to just close out their Facebook, or not respond to a text message, thereby ceasing interaction. They have to respond in real time, and only in the face to face encounters will developing children, adolescents, and young adults learn to cope with events that may be unfavorable to them.

I believe the internet has played a huge part in the rise of mental illness, giving those who are still mentally developing a way out when things get too tough for them.

But I think what Disney did was necessary.

Fans of the EU often say that if Disney was more creative they could have made a sequel trilogy within the boundaries set by the EU, but it would have made the trilogy even worse. The EU went up to at least ~130 years after Return of the Jedi and they basically told the entire life story of Luke Skywalker.

So when they opt out of ad tracking they're still going to get just as many ads as before, but they'll be mostly untargeted and random. That is a lose-lose for both the user and the advertiser. If you're going to have to see ads, then you're better off having them be for something you might actually have interest in and possibly purchase. 

If the opt-out was ""Don't show me ads anymore."" then of course it would improve the experience of the average user, but that's not what this is. Don't confuse the two."

What was supposed to be a beautiful day to celebrate a union, has now become a super stressful event, with many family members hurt in the process, loads of rubbish drama happening, people losing best friends, back-stabbing, emotional manipulation, jealousy, and not to mention exorbitant amounts of money flushed down the drain.  My heart aches when I think of all the collateral damage that takes place to create one of these events.

Let's start normalising non-traditional weddings, informal weddings, spur-of-the-moment weddings, low-key weddings, backyard weddings, silly weddings, crafty weddings.  Weddings where people can wear what they want, gift what they want, have the occasional naked kid running through the lawn sprinkler, the obligatory aunt falling asleep at the table, the young nephew getting a bit tipsy, without any of these things ruining someone's 'special day'.

CynicalDemon33,unpopularopinion,1620509027.0,YouTube needs a competitor,"I feel like YouTube needs a competitor. I know that Vimeo and Dailymotion exist but these are barely used compared to YouTube.

Lately, I feel like YouTube has gotten kind of stale and 'complacent' as a video-streaming platform. I still use YouTube and have a lot of channels I enjoy watching, but overall, I think YouTube is getting kind of boring and unoriginal.

I think YouTube needs a bigger rival/competitor because then that would push them (and maybe even force them) to improve their company more, improve their features, and be less complacent overall.

For example, Netflix has its competitors (Amazon Prime, Hulu), which push them to do better and improve as a company. KFC has its competitors (Popeyes, Chick-fil-A), which push them to do better and improve as a company.

But, I don't think YouTube has ever really had any major competitors (except maybe during the first few years when they started out), and due to YouTube's severe lack of competitors, I think they don't have any big incentives to improve as a company, and thus are becoming more complacent in their features and design."
KindOfScruffy,unpopularopinion,1620640816.0,Being 'so desperate' to go away on holiday because you haven't had one for a year is extremely dramatic and very priviledged.,"Since lockdown restrictions are lifting slowly here in the UK. I'm sick to death hearing about people saying that they genuinely feel 'depressed' or 'can't carry on' without going on holiday. All because they didn't get to go to an all-inclusive trip to Spain for a week.

Just because you can't go abroad or holiday parks, doesn't mean you can't enjoy the time off. Thats what annual leave in work is all about, booking time off to decompress and recharge your batteries. If you physically cannot do that without spending a good £1000+ to go away for a week. I don't believe you. You're just not trying to relax.

I know its a little different when you have kids and its a time for everybody to have a change of scenery, but you can still do that in your own country, just go for a drive to anywhere new for the day. Drive to the coast, hills, countryside, mountains, forests, rivers etc... There's a lot of possibilities you can still do without the ""NEED"" to go abroad.

EDIT: Let me say this louder for people not getting it. I'm not resentful, jealous or whatever towards people that want to go on holidays, you do you. This is specifically about the annoying people who pipe on and on about how they are 'suffering' or 'desperate' to get away."

Someone is not a toxic person if they don’t text you back every 2 minutes. Likewise, someone is not a toxic person if they *ask* that you text them back every 2 minutes. Those are not toxic traits, those are preferences, and differences in personality.

Especially babies cause they can't help the way they are. They're quite literally helpless. You were a baby too. So what if they scream and cry? They're completely helpless, can't walk or talk or feed themselves. Wouldn't you freak out?

Even though little children can think a lot more, they're still young and developing. They really can't help it. Sure they can be a bit annoying, but still... I find it very immature to hate kids honestly.

But that's just my opinion

Note: There's nothing wrong with hating it when kids cry and scream. But to hate an actual child? Come on...

Note 2: The point in, You were baby once too is:

1. they'll grow up.

2.They can't help being a baby.

So I don't see why you would hate something for existing and being what it is.

hraza99,unpopularopinion,1620453261.0,The plot twist for “Invincible” was obvious and over focused (spoilers),"Just finished bingeing the show, and while it was a pretty good one, did anyone else find the plot twist pretty obvious? Not trying to sound like r/iamverysmart haha but by like episode 2 I was convinced that >!Viltrumites were not benevolent and actually world conquerors<! . 

I feel like the show could’ve done a way better job of obscuring/building up to this, considering it was the major plot point for the first season. I love plot twist series/movies but if they’re done poorly it leaves a vacuum in the shows narrative as the viewer is just waiting for the characters to get up to speed for the entire programme.

All this is not to say I didn’t find the show entertaining, I’m a fan of the shows secondary themes (a protagonist that doesn’t curbstomp everyone he faces, robot’s kinship for monster girl, the more gritty side of super powered beings etc. - though as a sidenote I’ve seen a lot of parallels/comparisons drawn to “The Boys” which I think is leagues ahead of “Invincible” - but that’s perhaps another unpopular opinion haha.

TLDR: The main plot point for the first season of “Invincible” is underwhelming and over focused, devaluing what could’ve been a great show to just a good one."
andres991027,unpopularopinion,1620585329.0,It is unfair for organizations and developed countries to give crap to developing countries for exploiting their natural resources,"Most developed countries have gotten to the point that they are at by exploiting their natural resources to the point of almost complete depletion and with really bad effects to animals and plants that used to live their.

So in this era of sustainability I find it really ironic that many people, especially those of developed countries, give crap to developing countries for wanting to use their natural resources to the max. Some examples of this are Brazil and the deforestation of the Amazon forest. Projects like this will result in more jobs and a bigger influx of money to the country which is sorely needed. More sustainable projects are either too expensive or may require work that is too specialized to be as profitable. In my opinion it is a countries duty to prioritize the happiness and economic stability of its citizens over environmental issues. (I do think the environment is extremely important but I believe other issues take priority)

If developed countries and organizations really want to conserve natural areas they should be paying this countries some type of fee for not using their natural resources. This fee should be based on approximately how much money would have been obtained if the natural resources were exploited. Another alternative could be providing cheap and easy access to machinery and technology necessary for more sustainable yet profitable work. 

I am unsure if someone has said this already so sorry if someone has."
BlazeWolfEagle,unpopularopinion,1620552245.0,Honestly kinda hate GTA 5 at this point,"Just saw an article about how GTA 5 RP has taken over Just Chatting as the most popular category on Twitch, and a thought came up that I think I'm starting to hate GTA 5. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic game, as GTA games have become known to be, and it's definitely one of the best open-world sandboxes you can buy. 

But I honestly really hate GTA Online. As a game mode, everything about it is very strategically designed to get you to play a very specific way (get money for properties for more money for more missions that you can do). It's very much centered around the properties to buy, most of which are heavily unbalanced economy wise. This itself wouldn't be bad, the problem is that by function of sheer player counts a lot of the times, the only properties that matter are the really super expensive ones. GTA Online DOES have other missions and activities to do, but for the goddamn most part, it's just grinding missions to do the Doomsday Heist, one of the single most annoyingly long heists I've ever played. I could easily turn this into a rant about specific areas of GTA Online I dislike, but my more focused point is that GTA Online is boring in a way that feels intentionally designed so, as a fault of it's core gameplay loop of the economy. That's part of why they've made such a big effort in subsidizing in game stuff (1 mil used to take literal months to get as a new player, now you just get it for logging in if you have Amazon prime or PS plus). 

But a boring game is not something to rant about. My issue is that it's fucking GTA, meaning it literally can't be unpopular or die. And Rockstar fully knows that. People are still relentlessly hopeful for GTA 6, and that's honestly pretty good, but I personally have lost hope that GTA 6 is something Rockstar is seriously considering, and if they are, it will have entered development VERY recently. GTA 5 continues to make infinite money with zero effort and Rockstar knows that. That's why they're porting it to PS5. They don't see a reason to continue serious development of singleplayer titles or new titles, GTA 5 is the last GTA. And seeing this annoyingly boring game get infinitely more popular just serves to exemplify in my eyes a notorious bad practice in the media industry as a whole, and maybe even late-stage capitalism. In creative industries, the goal is not always to create the best thing to build up a reputation for making good things so that you sell more. A lot of the time the goal is simply to get to a point where you can make one infinitely sustainable thing that just generates money. 

I would argue this is the area a large amount of major franchises lie, which I realize is not at all a hot take. Everyone has memed on the endless assassin's Creed/call of duty sequels since like 2014, I get it. But still. Warzone is similar to GTA Online in this way, I'd argue. Warzone... Can't die. It's too big and too popular. Now, unlike GTA 5, Warzone is part of the battle royale trend and will probably eventually see it's insane popularity start to dwindle similar to PUBG Fortnite and Apex, but those games still pull huge numbers. And just like Rockstar, I think Activision knows that, which is why they made Warzone standalone. Just like GTA 5, no one actually wants to play Cold War or Modern Warfare, they just like Warzone, just like how Rockstar has neglected the singleplayer for so long that it's not worth playing again for most people. And also just like GTA 5, Warzone's devs do things that it's core players give feedback on that goes ignored. 

Anyway, sorry, rant over, I just wonder that if enough people felt the way I do, we'd have GTA 6 by now, and maybe we'd start to see more examples of ""evergreen"" games that still have significant active development, like Minecraft. 

Oh, and a little addendum, I have NOT played the Cayo Perico heist, I lost interest completely in it when they revealed that the area is only accessible WHILE you're doing the heist. I agree with NakeyJakey's video essay in that restriction is one of the major design flaws with Rockstar games. 

People have said that it's a really good heist, and I believe them, I just can't bring myself to do all the leadup it will inevitably require, like spending way too much money on buying the property or vehicle or whatever that even lets me start it, waiting through absurdly long queue times only to have someone leave and be forced to requeue, failing the mission over and over again for stupid reasons because matchmaking pairs you with bad players, potentially doing hours and hours of shitty ""drive here and do this then drive back for 10 minutes"" setup missions, and then finally being hugely disappointed when the payout is only like 1.6 mil (to be divided among, at minimum, 2 people) for something you wasted like 20 hours on."
MangoSouthern,unpopularopinion,1620645220.0,"Dogs dumped at Kill Shelters are there for a reason, and the average person should not adopt these dogs.","I think this is unpopular because anytime I’ve expressed this opinion I’ve been met with snide looks.

So, this isn’t me saying that these dogs *deserve* to die. It’s not even saying that they are lost causes that could never live with a normal person/family.

What I AM saying is that most dogs dropped off at a kill shelter as say a surrender are there because they had behavioral difficulties an average family couldn’t handle and didn’t think made the dog an easy to handle one or else they would have taken care to drop it off at a good shelter, OR the dog was taken from a bad family situation which created hardwired behavioral instabilities or problems the average family will not be equipped to handle; Or they were picked off the street and aren’t socialized at all in which case someone trained to socialize strays needs to work with it.

Basically unless someone is just a cruel and heartless bastard you’re getting a reject of some sort. These rejects could be made into proper dogs with proper training and socialization but this is about the average family and the average family as far as I can tell isn’t willing to put this work in. If you’re not a trainer or are not willing to put time in with a trainer it’s best to stay away from shelter dogs. Of course there are unicorns or very young puppies simply born on the streets but 98% of these dogs in these shelters should be avoided.

Go for a no kill non profit because they have something of a vetting process and you can bet with a higher degree of certainty that you are getting a dog that is worth a damn and could live a normal family life."

DrunkHemplar,unpopularopinion,1620636810.0,Psychopaths are the WORST and need to be either eradicated or permanently quarantined,"I know this is an EXTREME opinion but hear me out; Psychopaths are basically the worst thing to ever happen to planet Earth.

Let me list the crimes committed by psychopaths to varying degrees.

* Cigarettes being harmful to people but studies being buried
* Salem Witch Trials
* Spanish Inquisition
* Multiple crusades
* Fossil Fuels fucking the world over
* Corruption of the Vatican **MULTIPLE TIMES** over the centuries
* Genocide from so many evil-ass humans it would be hard to justify naming one over another.
* Denial of climate change by people who know WTF they're talking about
* Fixing the price of medicine
* Fixing the price of basic food items such as bread and water

I can keep going...the list is unending...

Basically psychopaths, active ones are the WORST thing to happen to humanity as a whole and these people need to either be executed or quarantined permanently so they can't hurt anyone else.

Now, psychopaths who decide to not hurt others, especially on a mass scale are OK. If they just don't feel things, provided they don't hurt others- fine! But the moment they cross that line they become an existential threat to humanity they need to be removed from humanity in whatever method is efficient.

Now who decides who is and isn't a psychopath is another argument - one that is susceptible to extreme problems but ultimately; would the world be better off or worse off if psychopaths were just shipped off to Antarctica; the world's newest penal colony or outright executed; depending on their crimes? I think so.

I think people who don't give any shits about who they hurt in their pursuit of whatever they peruse with no remorse in a realistic situation are not fit for life; they are an extreme threat and have already caused extreme damage to society as a whole.

With the mass execution or extradition of these people; they may not develop empathy but they would reign in their worst behavior as the only person a psychopath cares about is themselves. It would be in their best interest not to be evil bastards at the expense of everyone else, especially when lives are on the line.

Now, do I believe this is a policy that could ever be implemented? No. There's so many issues with this that boil down to 'subjectiveness' that this is a nightmare of an opinion logistically but if we could magically bypass those issues and make sure that active psychopaths were the only people who get bopped with death or exile to Antarctica; I think the world would be much, much better off as a race.

Evil exists and it doesn't care if you believe in it or not. The only thing evil cares about is itself."

Most of the time I read this online it's either that they did and the person doesn't remember, that they did in a slightly different format and the person is too dumb to realise (i.e. ""They didn't teach us how to do taxes"", open an algebra book, please), or that there was no need to teach that in school. 

> ""When am I ever going to need that?"" 

Everything taught up untill highschool is so elementary that just knowing it for the sake of knowing it is reason enough to learn about it.

Often times these are the same people that complain they have to choose majors at 18.

First of all no you can't. Plus even if you could there is nothing that can replace an academic setting and teacher, not yet at least.

big-gwala000,unpopularopinion,1620590662.0,skin bleaching and cosmetic surgery is the exact same thing tbh,"yeah so this is might be kinda controversial, but i truly believe that changing how you look through any kind of procedure should be regarded as all the same thing. 

nowadays, there’s a strong energy of “don’t shame people or treat anyone bad/weird because they got cosmetic surgery.” and i completely agree 

but then i feel in the same breath, don’t condemn or shame people who chose to bleach their skin? after all, there are lighter skinned people of every race so even the whole “you don’t want to be [insert race here] and that’s why you bleached” isn’t really a good argument 

and even with the whole “bleaching your skin can cause x diseases” i mean yeah, cosmetic surgery can also be botched and risk lives  frequently in fact 

idk just something i feel relatively passionate about i guess. because ultimately the reason why people surgically or procedurally change their appearance for aesthetic or cosmetic reasons is generally based in Oppressive Beauty Standards, so why do we condemn some but not others?"

People also use it as an excuse to not deal with problems. Instead of arguing and discussing a situation they dismiss it because they don't or can't deal with a fight or being wrong leaving the problem unsolved and the dismissal that is fluffed up with a ""kind"" comment just adds fuel to the fire.

I mean seriously people grow up, read the room, accept that life sucks sometimes, let people fail and be sad for a while. Stop with the unwelcome and often times hostile positivity."
EdwardBliss,unpopularopinion,1620506327.0,Tawny Kitaen's was symbolic of what music is sorely lacking right now,"Tawny Kitaen, the star of the Whitesnake videos, sadly passed away. This hits me just as hard as an Eddie Van Halen or Neil Peart. She represented a certain time in music---in culture---that we're sorely lacking right now. Decadence, danger, controversy, irreverence, sexuality, authenticity. Good times. Sleazy times. Fun times.

Music has become complacent. Sanitized. Watered down. Predictable. Corporate sponsored pop and rap has dominated our culture for so long. Most people now would argue we have all those ideals I mentioned above. Sorry, a commercial pop artists version of ""danger, controversy, and sexuality"" is a little different than what it was for hard rock bands in the mid to late 80s. They're all pansies now.

It's time for a change. Something different. A reset. It would be nice if rock and roll was central to our culture again when this shitty pandemic is over."
Brain_Janitor,unpopularopinion,1620440507.0,"Most ""Karens"" are actually mentally ill and we should pity them.","I don't think the actions of Karen's are justified. Nor do I think all Karen's are mentally ill, some are just arseholes. However, when I see videos of [Karens screaming into cameras, making strange faces or dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCAoMPKWIy0), I always feel a slight sense of pity for them. As someone who has worked in the service industry for many years, I've met plenty of entitled, rude and racist people but I cannot honestly say I've had an experience like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73cW4-P6uk0) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWy-g1eLBP4) , except from people I would immediately class as being mentally ill.

It could be a cultural thing - I've lived in Ireland for most of my life and most of these viral videos tend to come from the US or the UK, where it seems a larger population will just produce a larger amount of potential Karen videos. I understand some people can just be outright unpleasant and hate everything and still be mentally sound but I think most of these Karen videos are showing more people in the world need help with mental health problems than ever before.

 Now, I have no problem with these movies being on Netflix, but stop cramming them down my throat! Put them in their own category. Maybe make it known that it’s not an American film without having to go read the cast name and guess if it’s yet another foreign film. They’re almost exclusively Netflix productions, so it’s them choosing to increase their bottom line by €1 so fuck the consumer. If you’re a Netflix customer in Germany, you should have mostly German shows, with the option to watch all the other shit you want, without it being blasted in your face. Know your audience Netflix.

The song itself was kinda okay, but then Sean Paul started rambling his gibberish, the stupidity of which, paired with his annoying voice, just butchering the whole song. 
But that sparked my attention, and after doing some research, I found out that every song that features him is ruined by his talent. 
What annoys me most is, that no matter how the song is structured, he always pulls off his nonsensical latin-style bullcrap gibberish that DOES'T FIT THE GODDAMN SONG >:0

CanisIupus,unpopularopinion,1620444228.0,I hate the hunger games trilogy!,"WARNING THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS ABOUT THE HUNGER GAMES TRILOGY 































It is an terrible trilogy, the first book started out interesting and grasped my attention but near the middle it got boring extremely quickly, like seriously? ""Oh no kiss me peeta we must lIiIiiVe!"" The second book was ok but i feel like it was just pushing the line on the GALE OR PEETA line like JEEZ KATNISS JUST CHOOSE ONE it aint that hard. And the last novel was rushed and ended on a bad note. Katniss made me want to slap her in the face throughout the books like 1000 times. Peeta was always portrayed as a weak defenseless lover boy until he lost his mind and katniss tried to get him back. Katniss barely changed near the end of the series and had little  character development. Overall, sorry hunger game fans but the series is just not for me, half of the series is about a fake then real then fake then real love story between two characters while there's a frickin' war going on. Snow was an interesting character along with all the characters but katniss and peeta."
WitheredBarry,unpopularopinion,1620543873.0,"I feel part of the reason that the male exit rate is so high is because when a man makes a mistake, like hitting a woman, it is far more likely to haunt him for the rest of his life.","Exit = S-word

I think it's safe to say that society is more apt to forgive women over time than men, especially [according to criminal sentencing data. ](https://journalistsresource.org/criminal-justice/courts-lenient-sentencing-bond-women/#:~:text=Scholars%20have%20found%20that%20women,women%20shorter%20sentences%20than%20men.) 

If a woman hits a man, it's usually not treated as a big deal. Sometimes it's not even acknowledged, or even celebrated, as seen in the Heard-Depp debacle. 

However, if a man hits a woman, everyone who knows about it ends up holding onto that event for the rest of that man's life. The circumstances and actual level of violence don't matter. For example, my ex and I were shopping and a customer in front of us was being belligerent to the cashier. My ex shushed me and tugged on my arm to be quiet when I was about to confront the person. I gave her a *light*, hidden jab in the side, as a silent implication to please stop shushing me. According to her, it was a harder hit than I thought it was. 

The point is, no matter how well I explain the situation, apologize, admit responsibility, or reference the amount of therapy I've had since then, I'm still an abuser to anyone who knows about it. 

Similarly, I've had a former sexual partner spread rumors about me that have tarnished my reputation with a lot of people. It's like I can't escape any negative accusations and it's driving me insane. I don't want to lose any more friend groups. So now I hide everything, share nothing, and trust nobody... and surprise, I wanted exit too, at one point hospitalized. 

I feel like society doesn't give men a chance to grow or redeem themselves, and so they end up trapped in a cycle of depression and hopelessness. People make mistakes, but men seemed to be judged a lot harder for theirs."

I get you can bribe a cop, but boss rolls in and goes apeshit and no cop goes to the bad guys apartment?  Or sending in he neighbor to possibly get killed?  In Karachi in the 70s, there’s a kid that just speaks English?? Really?? Or the flashback to Afghanistan where the car breaks down due to the lower control arm breaking. Dude goes to the trunk and legit says, no spare tire. Wtf is that going to do when the front end is on the ground and your axle is toast? And he can steal a car in Afghanistan in the 60s and gets out of there alive? So many absurd instances of either lazy writing or directing. I suspend my belief less for marvel movies.

aStrangeCaseofMoral,unpopularopinion,1620602211.0,It's the wrong people having less children,"This will definitely sound like a douchy thing to say, but honestly it's true. Overpopulation is a massive problem, both regarding environment, as well as socially, nonetheless it isn't coming from French, Germans, Dutch, Italians... While these are the ones choosing to reproduce less while being able to provide with more stability to most children they decide to bear.

Overpopulation is coming from countries that will exploit children, leave them to starve and unfortunately even die, while promising them that if they migrate life will become better. These children could've been spared of all the suffering were these the countries to reproduce according to their own means.

Let's face it, overpopulation is the biggest humanitarian problem worldwide, but the discourse is hitting the wrong people (although obviously no one should be striving to hit the 10 kid mark in these countries either)."
LocalChamp,unpopularopinion,1620571033.0,I Hate Short Format Videos,"Disclaimer: I'm in my 20s so no this isn't ""boomer speak"". This is unpopular because obviously these types of videos are massively popular on dozens of platforms.

I never used vine, tik tok, snapchat, Instagram or Twitter. I say this because now that YouTube shorts is a thing it's become a problem for me. I've spent over a decade using the platform and watch dozens of hours of content weekly. However I don't use the YouTube home page or recommended videos. I'm very specific about how I curate my subscription feed and keep it to less than 100 channels at any given time. I have hobbies and interests and find specific channels about them. I'll find out about other quality channels either through searches or hearing about them. Even the generally higher quality channels I follow have started experimenting with the shorts format. This sounds fine until you realize that's a lot more videos spamming your subscription feed. I use a browser addon to hide videos I've already seen. Now I've even gone as far as finding way to filter out the shorts completely. I'm not going to claim all of them are bad, obviously I've seen some great ones. However in general I feel as though if something is worth seeing or finding out about it's worth going into more detail in a full length 8-10+, sometimes 20+ minute video."
KarmicComic12334,unpopularopinion,1620488391.0,Pan is a terrible choice of words to describe your sexual orientation.,"I have heard pan defined as being attracted to a person  without regard to gender, and personally identify with that. 

 i know that 'pan-' is a prefix meaning all.

But Pan was also a greek god, usually described as half man half goat, known for keeping a harem of nymphs and sheep. Naming your sexuality after A literal sex god implies you identify with the traits embodied by that deity. In this case hypersexuality and beastiality are always the first that come to mind whrn i hear it. I know it is not what people mean when they say they are pan, but i still cringe a little.

 * encourage better hygiene. Who wants to blow a sweaty cock? 

 * can be as romantic as the final kiss in a romantic Hollywood film

 * strengthen your embouchure

 * produce a liquid substance which can double as protein, glue, or lubricant for opening jars

 * offer warmth during the winter

 * simulate water guns during the summer

 * can be used to excrete pollen out of the blower's nose to prevent allergies in the spring (see ""Angry Dragon"")

So basically what I mean is if you’ve studied philosophy or like to read about philosophy and that philosophy was not analytical philosophy, then it’s like you’ve read fiction literature (note how I didn’t even say science fiction lol).

Clearly starting off, we have Fred himself. He's annoying, he has a squeaky voice, and he's stupid. But this is actually a metaphor for societies views on teenagers.

Next, we look at Camp Fred. In the movie Fred goes to summer camp. During the movie Fred's camp competes with another camp, for more affluent attendees. This is actually a metaphor for the ongoing class struggle in America

Tons of kids grow up thinking you’re supposed to apologize because that’s just the appropriate thing to do. If kids were allowed to not apologize if they didn’t want to, they would learn the consequences of that - the other kid they refuse to apologize to may hold a grudge and withhold toys, etc. and they will learn the natural way how to settle differences, etc."
Equivalent_Judge_307,unpopularopinion,1620463285.0,It's perfectly normal to let sexual history weigh in when choosing a partner,"I know this is, especially on reddit, very unpopular but hear me out. This post is in no way about slut shaming or hate towards people with a large or small body count. I'm talking about the choice of a partner, which is a pretty important decision in someone's life. Excluding people from that choice is no insult to those people in any way. 

What I'm saying is it's very normal to have a preference for someone with a small, or in some cases large body count. This can have various pwrsonal reasons, but for me it's about the view on sex, which I think is important to be on the same page with. Someone with 10 times my body count probably isn't on the same page as me when it comes to this topic. Selection on this is very normal and I know that a large percentage of the guys(can't tell for girls?) take it in consideration. This doesn't mean it HAS to be a deal breaker for everyone of course, but there is defenitely a preference for many people. 

These days it's normal to have a preference for haircolor, length, criminal history, how athletic someone is, age, job etc etc. But when you have a preference in terms of sexual history, you're suddenly called a slut shamer and a hater. Many of those things aren't even based on someone's choices, like hair color, while body count is purely based on choices. And someone's choices tell you more than the genetic color of one's hair. 

Also, I think gender in this matter is no point, it works both ways obviously."
