iSlurpees,depression,1620602439.0,Is this depression,"I felt on top of the world Friday night, everything was going for me.
Now I just feel so low and like I’m putting on an act whenever I’m with people.
I let myself get walked all over and don’t care.
I keep asking myself who would care if I didn’t come home.
I drink and don’t stop because it makes me the life of the party for a few hours.
Makes me not feel small for a while. 
But then I go back to being alone and the thoughts start coming back."

sugarpopp,depression,1620507768.0,Am I happy or am I delusional in my bubble?,"I am 25F, gonna turn 26 on 15th May. have been suffering from severe depression, on and off since 2018. Although I thought the extreme dark days and nights are long gone, I believe the wind keeps blowing back via triggers/memories/conversations. Sometimes when I’m calm and happy I start questioning my state- am I really happy? Or am I just comfortable in my delusional bubble? With my birthday coming up, I feel worse. Earlier I used to be so happy on my birthday, now the second birthday amidst a lockdown (I live in India) is scaring me. I am too afraid to even drink on my birthday because I feel I am going to end up crying and emotionally bursting about how I turned 26 amd I have not done anything meaningful in life yet. I don’t know what I want to do, I have a skill with which I am making nothing, I am lazy, scared, I lack determination. My general knowledge is zero, I feel like I have grown up to be an useless human."

21stcenturyschizoidf,depression,1620511475.0,Hungover again,"I (26F) always forget how bad I feel after drinking. Normally I avoid, numb, dissociate from bad feelings (or try to). But today I can’t stop crying, feeing regret over the semester I just failed, feeling aimless useless and broken, even going full idiot and hitting myself a bit when I feel those waves of intense self-hatred. 

I see why alcohol could be something to avoid in the future. It’s hard when it’s so normalized. 
I was definitely a binge drinker as a teen but I’ve grown out of that... but... maybe I just mask it better because I’m “high functioning”... 


I googled already how to get over hangover blues but I don’t think they’re written for the clinically depressed.

Scherzokinn,depression,1620579053.0,I don't feel very good and I just want random strangers to talk to me,"I've been in a depressive state since a year. Sometimes I get suicidal thoughts. My parents do everything they can to help me, I have a loving family and minor problems, but I still feel sad, and knowing that makes it worse for me. I get thoughts that I just would like to suppress, and my narrow obsessions take up all of my time, tires me and people don't care and it makes me feel more suicidal. I already have a psychologist and psychiatrist, but they aren't always there. I just want to discuss and express myself."
sergeantpuppers,depression,1620567165.0,Summer seasonal depression,"Just venting/wondering if anyone is feeling the same at the moment. It started a few weeks ago when Spring started taking hold - the sun is now out seemingly perpetually, and it makes me so annoyed and sad. Hell, the sight of a sunny day through the window will set me off into a horrible mood. I thrive in cold, rainy, and dark days during the spring. It’s like they recharge me, only to be drained by the next sunny day. I’m looking ahead to summer and dreading it...

In the autumn/winter, I feel like the world is alive, I just feels right. In the spring/summer, the world feels upside down and everything is horribly uncomfortable; you can’t choose how comfortable you are, the temperature is just always too damned hot. Always. 

Anyway, I really don’t know how to feel more comfortable in the summer. It’s currently so debilitating"
chloethedoggy,depression,1620641289.0,Everything turns phony when I smoke marijuana,"I have been smoking for about 2 years now (17 male), and I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, which I take meds for. When I first started smoking, before I was on my meds, I would get crazy panic attacks and feel like I was unable to breathe. Now that is fine, but something much worse happens when I get high now. I will seem to focus on things very much and completely break them down and judge them, until I point out all the flaws and phoniness in them. I especially do this to myself and the things I say when I am around other people, trying to have a conversation. I really like certain aspects of being high, but I can only now enjoy it when I am smoking alone in the middle of the night, listening to music or watching like one TV show, because everything else seems phony to me and I can't watch it. I am wondering if anyone can help me better understand this problem, and the possible effects that Wellbutrin and Zoloft may have on smoking and feeling this way. tHANKS."

ang_a1,depression,1620618285.0,COVID and mental health,"

I don’t even know where to start. If you feel like this comment below so I know I’m not alone & we can get through this shit together. 
Okay so where do I even start lmao. I literally treat reddit like my therapist. 
First of all this Covid lockdown is literally killing me mentally. I’ve been just on airplane mode if you know what I mean .. I’m here but everything is autopilot mode. I don’t think of things I’m just day dreaming or not even I literally have nothing in my head lmao it’s just silent and I’m just doing my things. 
I moved to another province a year ago and I have friends but god do I ever feel alone. I always feel alone no mater what where or who I am with. My friends here have their own groups and that’s totally okay with that. But when I’m with them I always feel like I’m talking too much or not saying enough or I am extremely boring and they just want to go home. Because they don’t hangout with me the way their own group does WHICH AGAIN I understand because I’m their new friend and they have been friends for years. 
I feel this emptiness in my chest, I just wanna scream at the world for nothing. I am tired of sitting at home 24/7 and it is so extremely hard to get a job right now and I am so unmotivated to do anything. And trust me I’ve tried doing shit. I’m thinking maybe this is because I’ve had a lot going on last year from 2019-2020 because my best friend had cancer and passed away and I haven really touched into that. I know she’s gone but I have not come to terms with it. I don’t know how. I think I just stored it away and god knows when I can deal with it. I cry and I’m sad sometimes that she’s no longer here but I’m not sure if I have grieved Normally ??  I just had a crying stage stressed stage I couldn’t believe it and I still can’t. Pls don’t tell me it’s unhealthy I know it is but I don’t know how to deal with it. 
Basically I feel empty for no reason sometimes. Last week I had a heard week for some reason just a lot of emotions built up I went for a walk and just started bawling my eyes out and the weird thing is it was so cloudy outside and the sun literally was shining above me it felt like a warm hug from my friend. Anyways I feel weird sad like I’m not even here just autopilot mode."
AmetuerGamr15,depression,1620602403.0,What's the point,"I already know my life isn't going anywhere so what's the point? I'll never find love, I'll never find anything that fulfils me. I want to die but I'm too scared."
NoxFerrarius,depression,1620584012.0,"I don’t really know if I want be cured anymore, but i don’t think I can kill myself","I’ve tried a lot of useless treatments. despite all my attempts I am still not cured, I remain eternally alone and afraid of the world, the future and the universe.  I have spoken with a lot of people about a lot of subjects from all angles and I am still unable to heal myself, to socialize, to find myself a job or to put myself in a relationship.  my country has no laws to help people with depression, it is getting really hard to even have hope and I think I have to stop there.  the worst part is that I don't even think I can kill myself.  It’s a very hard act to do and I’m not even able to go through with such a project.  I guess then I have to go on ""living"" with this disease that is eating my brain.  I don’t think I’m looking for help today, just support."
cyrano4833,depression,1620577083.0,the grenade in my pocket,"I was already ""grown up"" (well, never mind that, nearing 40) when I saw a movie called ""Trust."" That was 1991, I think. Grown up, maybe, but still f\*\*ked up as well, years past my only suicide attempt but seeing my third or fifth psychologist/psychiatrist/counselor/therapist anyway. In the movie, Martin Donovan plays a classic misfit who, among other things, carries a hand grenade in his pocket-- just in case. BTW, it has a happy ending, not one with the grenade exploding. Happy of a sort, I guess.

There are millions of details from my past that have long faded from memory but that movie stuck with me, especially the grenade part. In the following years, I always felt that suicide was my just-in-case grenade. I'd tried it (suicide, not grenades) and ""failed"" due to someone who ""saved"" me by cutting me down from the tree limb.

Flash forward to now, after my eighth or tenth counselor person and a session of TMS where I was pronounced ""cured"" by the experts (did I answer their questions honestly? I think I did; on that morning, I hadn't had any suicidal ideation, was sleeping better (was never really a problem), and forget what the other questions were. They and my insurance company were happy to pronounce me cured, which only took maybe 10 days to evaporate. Getting a bill from the provider for half the cost (low five figures, not including the decimal point) didn't help but they're saying it was just a billing error. Well, I hope so. Who says I have no hope?

But the bottom line is it feels more and more like grenade time. I've worked on myself for so long, trying to improve myself in the ways I've been shown, and I'm tired of trying to improve. I certainly haven't started loving myself-- the concept is absurd for me; something there is inside of me that is so deeply flawed. Well, outside too; I have unfortunate facial features and a hard-to-pronounce name that I've waited too long to change to ""John Smith."" My body is weak, tired, and hurting from too many years of bad posture. Mostly by choice, I have few friends but I suspect they'd drop me like a stone or give me platitudes if I told them more of the truth. 

They can't cure me. I can't cure me. I can't think of a thing i want from today, tomorrow, next week, month, year. I sure as s\*\*t don't want another decade. Just like I check my back pocket to see if my wallet's still there, I check my virtual pocket for the virtual grenade."
srkdpu,depression,1620565461.0,Is betterhelp a good enough service? Other affordable yet reliable services?,"I live abroad in a country where I don't yet speak the language, but I need some options for getting help. I am considering such a service as the waiting times in my case are quite big.

Have you tried any of these? Are they good? Are they reliable or is it a cash grab? I need it probably for long-term-ish; at least some months.

The other option is to look for something online from my home country."
Pabst-Pirate,depression,1620540026.0,Seeking help. Who do I talk to and what needs to be said?,"I’m not trying to gush all of the things in my head here, and I’m not looking for a pity party to make me feel like I’m not alone. But enough is enough. I am just sooo tired and I don’t know what to do. I went to a therapist years ago, and I didn’t know what to say then either. It was 30 minutes of small talk. I don’t think she ever got deeper than the guarded surface; and I didn’t know how to let her in.

I’ve been off work for a covid related respiratory issue since December. I have never felt so alone. In the decade I’ve devoted to my job all of my friends have focused on their families and careers while I’m just here, alone in my home. Nothing seems to matter anymore, nothing interests me and everything is a huge bother. I’ve tried to focus on my house, with little success... I just want to feel ok again. I want to want to do things. I want to talk to people and not feel like I’m burdening them with my presence. I want more than I’ll ever have, and that makes me, for lack of a better term, unbearably sad.

How do you start getting better, when you know you need to talk to someone, but you don’t know how to let someone in or express yourself in a way that’s beneficial to your treatment."
_perpetualparadox,depression,1620511027.0,Anyone feel this?,"My well-intentioned boss could tell I wasn't ok today. We talked alot, she mentioned getting brain scans and proper care.

Then she mentioned something along the lines of gratefulness and how it changes the brain. 

This has to be one of my most despised pieces of advice.

I don't believe people become depressed because they lack gratefulness. I often feel quite grateful. Despite this, I still feel major depressive episodes.

The idea that positivity, manifestation and gratefulness can cure depression feels so fucking delusional to me."
Emergency-Fig-4055,depression,1620423092.0,Need someone to talk to please help,I haven't experienced sadness like this before. It feels like my heart it gonna burn a hole through my chest. My bestfriend who I've known for years now parted ways with me. We dated for a few months then had an on and off thing for a while. She turned into a completely different person after the first major altercation. Ever since I've felt like I'm the only one trying to keep our relationship intact. Today she apologized for everything and told me that she couldn't stay with me anymore and it hurts so much to think that someone you loved so much could just leave you so easily. She was my only support and has even saved me from committing suicide a couple of times. I feel completely empty. Thinking about how life would continue without her makes me want to kill myself properly this time. I just need someone to vent to right now. Someone who can help me decide what to do after this. Please help.

I know I shouldn't focus on being ""good"" at things, or compare my creative passions to other people...but i can't help it anymore and it's killed my drive for everything I'm passionate about because all I see is how awful it is.

hotcoco-jo16,depression,1620518305.0,Depression in college,"Can anyone relate to me? I’ve never had such unexplainable sadness until this year. I’m so tired of crying every single day. I tried to go to the gym today and I started crying on the treadmill. 

This past year has been so hard and I’m failing to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The struggles I faced are small in comparison to everyone else but they have just built up over the past year and knocked me down. It all started January 2020 with feeling lonely at school, then getting dumped, conversion to all online and strict lockdowns, my older brother having serious mental health issues that led him to come home for treatment, my dog dying, roommate issues, and lack of determination and drive for a future or job. Even the smallest things like an internship rejection has made me felt unworthy and like no one likes me. The worst part is knowing I haven’t felt a sustained sense of happiness since fall 2019, and I don’t know when I’m ever going to be that happy again. 

I have very few friends and I am self conscious of who I am as a person since I’m sad all the time. I wouldn’t want to be around me either."
EurekaSeven333,depression,1620515061.0,I just don't know what to think anymore,"Alright, the reason I'm doing this is because I need advice.

I'm in a very difficult situation with my parents, like strong daily arguing and obviously my physical and mental health are suffering greatly from this. To keep it short, the type of depression where you don't feel anything anymore and suicidal thoughts, but only thoughts. I have no intention to kill myself anytime soon, I just think about it a lot, like how I would do it or how people would react and in general just wishing to die without having to do it myself.

So, what exactly goes on at the moment in my family? I'm a 16 year old boy who lives with his mother and stepfather after she broke up with my father. I still see my father every 2 weeks over the weekend, these are the only times I can truly relax from the life here. Why I need to relax? Because my parents here treat me like fucking shit. I often think about if I really have that much of a bad life, as there are so many kids having worse, but I came to conclusion (after I asked tons of persons for their opinion) that it doesn't matter, because that doesn't changes the fact they treat me bad.

Let me explain how my daily life looks like:
I wake up at 7am in the morning, ofc on Saturdays and Sundays as well, that's what my parents tell me to do. After that I go to school and come back home between 1 and 4 pm, based on which day it is. And that's when it just starts getting ridiculous: Often I can't even put away my school stuff in my room because my mother (stepfather works until around 5pm every day) already wants me to do something. Mostly normal things like vacuuming, the dishwasher, walk with our dog, take the empty bottles and stuff down in the basement, taking the trash outside. Basic house stuff. The problem there is not the work itself, but the mass of it and the fact that she herself doesn't do shit all day. She doesn't work, she never did, so she just casually sits home everyday and watches television and plays on her phone, my little sister is in kindergarten after all. At the point I come home my little sister is already back home though. So that's when she starts playing her game. She doesn't do shit all day, but when I'm back home and have done the basic stuff she should have done while I was in school, I don't have free time for myself, god no. Then I can play with my little sister, after she just sat in front of her own phone until I finished the work I had to do. (She is four years old and as long, maybe even longer on her phone than I am) After she just watched YouTube or whatever, I am the one who should go outside and play with her, because my mother suddenly has to do stuff and can't do it. Like the few things I can't do, like washing clothes or cooking. After she has done that she goes back to her television and I have to continue to play with my sister. Or do some other work in the house. That's basically how it goes until 7pm, every single day. After that I eat dinner. At least sometimes, I'm a more or less picky eater, but not like I don't eat healthy stuff or something like that, I simply almost vomit eating some things like onions. Meaning, if these are inside dinner I simply can't eat it. And guess who doesn't care: My parents. Onions in almost every second damn dinner. I can't even eat it if I feel like I starve. That's why I'm way too skinny, it happens that I don't eat anything for sometimes 3 days straight. And well, then I have a tiny bit of time for myself right before sleeping, I mostly use that to simply check on my friends and social media, nothing more. Ofc if anything bad happens, like a bad mark or I'm pissed because they treat me like shit, it's always the fault of my phone, because I can't do anything but play games on my phone. Seems Legit.

But that doesn't end here, not at all. Ofc weekends are the worst days in week. Because I wake up, work e.g. outside basically until it's getting dark. The whole day.

Oh yeah, I don't know ofc how americans handle like pocket money and all that. But only a few months ago I got 10$ for a whole month, nothing more. And if I wanted something I had to buy it myself. That's basically a single time eating fast food with my friends and my money for the whole month is gone.

The worst thing about my parents here is their character in the end. Because, how can I put this as simple and friendly as possible.. They are the most ignorant, stupid, racist, egoistic, fucking worst people on this planet.

For example, every time I say that they do something wrong, or if I get louder in an argument with them because I can't take it anymore. It's always ""respect"". They see respect as something they have the right to get only because they are my parents. And, in their eyes, respect is basically slavery. Meaning, I don't have respect for them if I:
1.Don't do willingly everything they say, every time they say
2.Run while doing everything, because I'm just a lazy ass, I have to almost run doing stuff because I'm ""too slow""
3.Accept that they are ALWAYS in the right. No matter what, I have to accept what they say, if I even argue I get told I have no respect and I automatically lose. Meaning I can't even change things, as there's only one right opinion for them, which is their own. Everyone else is wrong. Seems Legit again.

I've tried reaching them several times, friendly, unfriendly, alone, with a friend, with a therapist, through talking, through writing a letter. I tried everything. Not that they would care about any of that. Because everything they do is right.

I'm at a point where I just can't take things anymore. I use every bit of time I have between two tasks to sneek in my room and just sit on my bed. When someone asks what I'm doing again instead of working I say ""nothing"".

For them, nothing equals looking at my phone of course. But if I say ""nothing"", I mean looking at my wall, thinking about death, thinking about why I deserved this, thinking about if really they are wrong or if I'm just a fucking wimp who can't do anything, if I'm the problem. Then, once again, I asked a lot of people if it's right what my parents do. Random strangers, my dearest friends, some distant family and my real father, online question portals. Every single person I asked said what they do is wrong. They all pity me, living under these conditions for 16 years now. Never having much money, or expensive clothing. Not because we can't afford it, but because obviously I'm not worth it. My 19 year old sister always got anything she wanted, to a point where she got 300$ shoes every two weeks. And goes who paid 30 dollar himself for some no name shoes lmao

The reason for this post is seeking for advice and help. I want, I need opinions of people I never met before. People who can analyze my parents and tell me if they are in the right or wrong. So, I don't care about if I'm the problem, I just need to know. I can't imagine that they are the good ones here. I'm feeling worse daily, physically and mentally, probably almost reached a state where I can never fully regenerate from ever again. So please, people of Reddit, tell me what to do, tell my about my parents rights and wrongs, what I should do.

If you have any more questions, please ask them. I haven't included even half of the problems in here, so don't be afraid to ask, I will happily answer everything you want to know! 

By the way, I feel like I should add this: I don't know much about other countries, but CPS isn't as easy in germany. I can't expect help from them as long as I don't get hit by them, or seriously injured another way. Which they don't do at the moment, except for some small hits when I showed no respect again in some discussion.

Oh yeah, it's 1am here rn and my English isn't the best, so please don't have a choke reading this lmao

Everyone who read this, I seriously thank you. For everything, even if you don't care, just because you listened to my problems already means a lot to me. Everyone reading this, have a great day, you deserve it the most!"

I have almost failed out twice simply for not doing my assignments and I don't know how to continue. I also lost my job recently. Plus, everyday is a struggle and I have to find ways to distract myself in order to simply be sane. I can't really express myself very well when other people ask if I'm okay, although I say yes always I'm secretly rotting inside. Sometimes I simply wish to walk away from it all, to dissapear from friends and families and lose myself in a part of the world I don't really understand. However, I'm pretty sure I would end up perishing in the first few weeks, but that doesn't seem to bad. I don't know if I like life anymore, everything good just sort of dissapears or fades away with time. Even activities I used to enjoy are slowly losing their touch. Eventually, I'll have nothing left. How the hell am I suppose to be an adult when I can't even figure out how to life until tommorow. Hell, I can't even do shit without drinking a few beers to simply numb my ever anxious mind into oblivion. I don't want to push people away, but just look at this. No one deserves to read this, to feel like this or to try and deal with someone like this."

TheNumbahSeven,depression,1620578226.0,I'm afraid of her...,"(as I am writing this she is sitting next to me we're in a car).

I've been spanked by this woman all my life. And I always cower in fear whenever she come near me. And I feel now that she's hiding something as serious as sexual assault from me. 

 I have been suspicious that I might've been raped as a young child, because I have really bad bedwetting problems when I was younger and when I asked my mom about that issue shes quick to dismiss it. I feel like I have. Even though our memories are so blurry, the abuse as a child is so far awhile. The Pedophilia encounter I had remembering almost agreeing to becoming a sugar baby. I suffered from a supposed ""kids chat"" I just fee like something isn't right. Like somewhere I feel like my memories of the rape I had. I can't seem to remember it. And when I bring it up to somebody my family seems to brush it off. Also whenever I talk to a family friend my mom lectures and insists I might've been sexually involved with them. If I never have been. The one time It happened (I will call him Joe). I was just saying hi to our family friend Joe. But my mom and step dad thought I was having sex with him. All because the nosy bus driver saw me talking to them. Like... Is that odd? Because they are friends with the guy who I said hi to. I also remember vividly almost agreeing to have sex with a boy at 13/14 in a residential home I was in (It was intersex). I almost never went through with it. (Thank God)! I never saw the dude again. Was for the best, because his temper is as bad as a storm. Because I always thought he might beat me if I did anything slightly wrong, I already have memories of abuse at a younger age. Which caused my DID and Trauma. And why I flinch whenever someone raised their hand or try and high five me. 

What also makes it worse, she smokes and I begged her to stop because it makes me cough really badly. She  yells at me and tell me to shut up, I also tried to call the cops on her to escape her. But they did nothing stating if I'm under her care then I should abide by her rules. 

What rules? She also almost suffocated one of our Alters Octavia to death by pressing her weight on us, restraining us. We begged her to stop to the point that the cops were involved and I was sent to the mental hospital, I hate how she treats me. I'm planning to run away once I get the chance. Because she never listens to me, like whenever I don't listen to her she gets upset. And I ask her why don't you listen to me. She always says I am an adult I don't have to listen to you. She prevents me from getting a job, she also doesn't let me do anything I feel like a prisoner in my own home. She always makes ""deals"" which are half assed deals. Like I would get a job or learn how to drive when daddy gets home (Step dad is in prision and she's so hopeful hes coming out but he isn't) So. I am Afriad of my mom who is a control freak."
Bleven,depression,1620575157.0,Been depressed for as long as I can remember.,"My mom passed away 1.5 years ago at 71.  I know that sounds old to some but her mom lived until 97 and her grandmother until 99 so I thought I would have more time.  It's not just that dad's got Alzheimer's sister and I were never close so it feels like I have no family left at all. 

I'm in my late 40s and this just isn't how I imagined life, I have no friends or any goals or things I care about. I can't think of one thing I actually want to do. I feel like I am getting weaker mentally and physically by the day.   Maybe it's because I never had kids but I don't see the point of life. I have seen everything there is to see and done everything I care to do. I don't want to hurt myself but I do feel like I finished my life a couple of decades back and I am just waiting for the ride to finally stop.

I have very bad anxiety and OCD so even if I get the desire to go out in the world, I have to complete a long cleaning ritual which is tiring physically and mentally as I tend to spaz out and panic about getting sick. I guess this is just a rant thanks to anyone who read it."

Jason5Lee,depression,1620544226.0,Depression ruined my life.,"I used to be a good college student. I got high scores in my courses, I had a good relationship with my classmates, and most importantly, I loved my school life.  
Everything changed in the second year of college. I got depression and I started losing motivation to study and communicate. I became anxious and painful. I lost my friends and failed my courses, and my GPA went from the top to the bottom.

I was diagnosed with depression when my parents discovered my changes and sent me to the doctor. I started my treatment and I started recovering. I'm still fighting with depression today but I can at least get my things done.

But the thoughts of my life is ruined always haunt me. I always fall into thinking that I used to be a good student with a good GPA and a good relationship. I could become successful, maybe get into a better University for a Master's degree, or get a job in a good company and started my own career.

But I ruined it all because of my weakness. Now my GPA is trash, people around me don't like me, my parents are disappointed, my future is gloomy, I can never become who I was. Sometimes I even wanted to end my life because ""my life is already ruined"". I feel like I have lost the meaning of my life, and I have no reason to continue."

At 15 I was diagnosed with major depression
At 18 I was diagnosed with anorexia and bpd

I've been diagnosed with a number of other conditions but these are the most prevalent. For as long as I can remember i have wanted to die, or at least have wanted to end the mental pain life brings.
One of my earliest memories was an odd one. I was 6 years old and sitting next to my mum, and I remember asking her ""can I die?"" all whilst sincerely wishing that would happen.
From the age of 8 I have expressed concern and distaste in my existence, and have on regularity apologized to my parents for being alive, for wasting their time and money and energy.

I've always felt loved and cared for, yet despite that I have never felt worthy of love and care. Over the years I have be compelled to do anything in my power to NOT be loved and cared for; my most recent attempt was me ghosting my family for a few days before unknowingly returning (disassociated and returned home without realizing).

I've never had a job, I've never been to higher learning, I've done nothing but cause pain to myself and others. I'm a complete fuck up and a complete burdnern to anyone that comes into contact with me. 
I'm losing my friends and my family are starting to get sick of my bullshit and have a number of times wanted to kick me to the curb.

I see no goals in life, no reason to live. The eminence guilt I have for being mentally screwed up is huge, and the guilt I have for wanting to die is even worse. 
The only reason I'm still alive is because of my guilt and self hatred; if I was selfish I would die, if I loved myself enough to die i would, but living is more of a punishment than death.

My only goal in life is to become even worse. Its to become homeless, loveless, forgotten by the world and by those who care for me. I want everyone who doesn't hate me to hate me, and for those who love me to revolt me. I want and I deserve to be a faceless husk, suffering until i die some horrible death. I need to suffer before I die, and onlt after I have suffered can I end my life."

I plan to read it in few years, like a book. Will put in ""*\[text\]*"" the notes I discovered years later.

**TL;DR : Lol. Not even sorry.**

\-----

**1) Early life/Behaviour**

Since i'm born, i'm a lonely wolf. I was a quiet child, playing in my room without a lot of noises, never yelling or crying according to my mom and my whole family. My mom usually had to check on me if I still was in my room, or if I was hungry etc. + I was a good student, good marks (until 12-13yo), never disrespectful towards teachers (or anybody). I was just too quiet and never ask to participate in classroom.

*\[I'm still a lonely wolf today, I REALLY need time alone to feel good, playing games or just talking to myself or not talking at all for few hours, nothing related with depression. Plus, I now tend to be rude to people, felling jealous about what I had to do to be ""normal"" when they complain about her coffee being a bit too cold or stuffs like this\]*

My parents divorced when I was 8. Let's say my early life ends there. Before that, the only memories I have are:

\- No memories about my father

\- My mother struggling to help my with homework

\- My brother being the bad boy at home (he's 6years older), and getting bad grades

\- School being easy and I'm not interested into making friends, I used to watch the cars at the window or doing exercises (I remember maths only, dunno why) *\[I was more mature than other kids of my age, so they seemed boring to me\]*

\- At home I usually spent a lot of time alone as my parents were busy arguing (pre-divorce ""gift"")

*\[I was too young to figure out what the divorce was, that's why my memories seem random, but today I know why I have these specific memories\]*

\--------

**2) Divorce and post divorce**

After the divorce, my brother and I were going to with my father. The news I had were : We lack a lot of money that our mother stole, she disappeared and didn't want to see us again, my father would work a lot (4am-9pm) to get money at home.

Once again, I wasn't very impacted, I was still playing video-games, getting good grades, and I was still silent and polite. At this time, it spent many hours per day playing videogames (Diablo II, Warcraft III) and nothing else. At this time, I was playing with older people online, and it was nice.

I saw my mother, about 10-15 days in 10 years. I didn't get why I had to go to her place if she wasn't interested in seeing us. My brother was angry to her, refusing to visit her, I usually went alone and as i was a child, I mostly... played with toys/games. Was a bit weird to see her as I thought she left us, but I didn't care that much, I was only interested into playing. But when I came home, I always had my father talking bad about my mother, saying she tried to buy me when I had new toys or when we went to the restaurant. At this time, I obviously had no link with my mother, and I slowly lost it with my father too.

*\[My mother was the one who had no money, and had to create a whole new life, plus spending all her freetime crying about the situation and trying to get us back, when I went to her place, it was a very good moment for her, even if I was only playing and eating at restaurant, she didn't know what to do else. My mother's family told her I was stubborn af and I'd never fall into my father's propaganda despite my brother. They were right.*

*I guess at this time I lost my self-esteem, I was used by both my parents to their advantage without even thinking about my feelings\]*

Obviously, I was like a nerd, i never used my phone even if I was lucky to have one at this time, I never went out to see friends or even seeing the sun. My life was playing video-games, showing the teacher I understand the lesson and looking at my brother trying to cook basic meals. (Note: my father was working hard, so my brother and I were alone in the house 90% of time, as he only came to sleep on weekdays and only being there on weekends + I was in a bad area, other kids were rly bad at school, I wasn't a genius, just a serious kid.)

At this time, I didn't feel depressed. But everything was set up.

*\[I learnt years later that my father manipulated us and my mother to separate us. He told her we weren't there or didn't want to see her, and he told us she left without giving news. My mother tried to find a legal solution, but it took sooo long. I got 18 before the process could end. The divorce was asked by my mother, because of my father's drinking issues. Seems he spent more time drinking than working while my brother and I were struggling on how to cook a frozen pizza. Talking about my brother, my father's propaganda worked a lot of him, because my father said thing like ""You can't have gift for your birthday because of your mother's divorce"", luckily I wasn't impacted as I never expect anything for my birthdays or in general\]*

\----

**3) The depression**

When I got around 12, I went to middle school, I discovered a new world, as the building was also a high school and had superior student. I was a young man facing 20yo people. Was a shock for me, I only knew my videogames and some basic school stuffs. And from now, many lessons/subjects, many student, many personalities (It was a private school, and I came from a public elementary school). At this time, the worst episode of my life began. People in this school were huge groups, and when you have a little nerd not talking, it's easy to insult/criticize him.

\+ Important point, I smelled bad everyday, didn't know why, even few hours after taking a shower. *\[Discovered at about 17 that I had a malformation, I can now control it, only my wife is impacted now as we live together\]*

I was the guy who smelled bad since elementary school (from 6yo to 16-17yo).

I was rejected by everybody, even the teachers started to ask if I took shower everyday. Was unbearable. the students always found a way to be united against me. At this time, I started a depression, but I kept it in my mind, because I just never thought about any advantage of talking about it to someone else (rather than myself), I just focused on video-games to escape this reality. My self-esteem reached 0% at this time.

Once, I replied to a guy that I could kill him if he did not shut up, in front of my whole male class (we were in changing room before sport). He thought I'd be afraid to get hit, but I ran like an animal on him, I wanted to fight to release the pressure. I realized he was afraid of me even before hitting him. Other boys went to separate us. At this time, I realized I have the Power. I could take a decision I want even if it's not objectively a good one.

The next year, at 13. I had two bad events (in addition to the one above). My teachers were VERY BAD, like 18th century teacher, or teacher giving bonus points to exams if you have a beautiful textbook (I was a nerd with no parental education, my textbooks were a bunch of drafts). So my grades started to fall down for no reason. + My father started to meet other women, the week-ends we were alone with my brother or worse, we had to meet his changing new girlfriend (and their kids, friends etc.) SO I got less and less time alone. SO I was less and less happy. He finally met a girl, who had an identical life. A perfect match. At this time, I started to notice that SHE was drinking a lot, and I slowly noticed that my father did it too. In the evening we could hear them laughing, talking out loud or....having fun until late in the night.

I made my first review of myself at 13, just before my birthday (I remember a picture of me taken with my birthday cake while watching straight to the camera and thinking ""I'm really not good rn""). This is an important picture to me, as it is the farthest memory of me felling depressed. I probably was before, but can't remember precisely.

From there, I don't have a lot to comfort me:

\- School grades were going bad (I was expected to fail my year)

\- School relations were the worst (I was known by everybody for bad reasons)

\- My father was absent, spending his free-time drinking or with his gf, my grades weren't that bad for him as he never understood the point of studying.

\- My brother was as lost as me, but as he was older, the spent time on parties drinking and taking drugs. (bad ending, don't do drugs.)

\- I have my ""issue"", and I don't know how to act with, and everybody (family, other students included) thought I was just a teenager who does not take showers.

\-This situation made me realize I also couldn't resolve anything, I did NOTHING in my life except playing video-games, literally nothing, I don't listen to music, I don't watch movies, I don't watch TV, I don't get out. Like during the COVID, but during my whole life and without Internet. And this point, leads me straight to a deep depression.

*\[This situation was unfortunate bad events showing up at the same time, but the biggest issue to me at this time was ""not being like other kids"" who went to cinema, got fashion clothes, had some love relationships, etc. and seeing that my youth will never be the same. Today's life is still impacted by this issue, I often don't know simple things people know since childhood + My father was drinking more than usual since he met his gf, as he spent less time working, and more time at home\]*

On my family side, my fathers decided to stop working a lot to have a normal life with his gf, whom he married. So he had less money for gifts, but more time for drinking.

*\[Once again, money wasn't an issue itself, he got a lot of money by working, but he spent ALL of it in alcohol, leaving nothing left for us. My brother and I now have 1001+ stories about all the lies/situation we had, like once he went on a week vacation with his second wife, and emptied the fridge, leaving me alone for 2 days with NOTHING to eat except olive oil and some half-eaten butter. He even took the sponges! I was still a student with 0 money at this time (obviously). Or when he tried to say that I had a handicap to allow me not to go to school and look for a job. So I could help him financially.*

*I never invited anybody to my house because I was ashamed to show my father to anybody\]*

\-----

**4) The suicid attempt**

*\[Not a long part, but was the separation between my early life and today's life, so it deserves a whole chapter\]*

Remember when I said i had the Power to take decisions ?

When I was 14, I was fully depressed, but my brother was trying to leave the house so he didn't saw me falling, and my father was drinking. At school, they were shocked that I went from top 10% best student to 10% worst in 1 year, they didn't know what to do except menacing me to be expulsed from this private school. (My father paid for it, and it was tough for him to pay something for me, so he was kinda ok to put me back to public school)

One day, as I was walking to school by feet (My father didn't pay for bus/bike obviously), I stopped by. I asked myself : 'Do I want to go to school ?"" Then ""Do I want to go home ?"". ""What do I want"" ? Leaving my life ? Yes.""

We had recently moved out to a new town, but near enough for my school. I knew how to go to school, but I didn't know the city at all. + I'm REALLY bad a orientation. Even today.

So, I decided a simple plan. I knew a couldn't try to kill me with a knife or medication, because I couldn't with 100% chance one-shot me (I learnt it from video-games) so I had to find a perfect solution. It was to get lost. "" What if I walk straightforward, taking sometime to the left, or right, lost in my thoughts ? I'd be totally lost, until I die and obviously cannot go back as I am bad at orientation and have no phone."" The plan was perfect. Nobody could follow/find me as I had no plan, no goal.

BUT, it worked so well, that i didn't notice that I was on THE MAIN ROAD leading straight to my house. My brother randomly found my while driving in the city, looking for me. I'm not able to make the difference between a small dead-end road and a huge street full of cars. Sounds crazy today, but I almost never left my house, I didn't know.

*\[I learnt a lot of things:*

*- My fathers just drank a bottle when school called him to announce I wasn't at school, and thought I was just a stupid teenager that would go back home when I'd be hungry.*

*- My mother got called by my brother, and came to my house after several years without any news*

*-I almost told nothing about why I left the house to the policemen, nurses and my family, I only said after 5-6 hours of silence that I had issue with my father. I when to a psychologist, and after 1 session, I noticed this one was freaking bad. She explained me that she would be a parrot between my father and me, she thought I wanted to talk to him, lol.\]*

\----**5) Waiting ?**

Surprisingly, no apocalypse after this. I just changed school to a public one, so my grades went back again (no textbook checking anymore, only classic exams). I met the nerds group of this new school, and i'm still playing video-games at home. This was almost a good thing I tried to leave.

My father and his new wife remain the same, drinking and not really paying attention to us, as long as we don't cause troubles that would cost money.

Personally, I began to change, I wanted to fight, I wanted to be alone, to find a solution to all my issues. I wasn't the quiet/shy boy anymore, Life is shit, and i'll shit on it. Not even sorry.

At 15-16, I reach high school. I'm quite a good student as I'm way less disruptive and got better grades and most of the students. (At this time, I never did any homework or learnt any lesson since my parents divorced) I also start to control my smelling issue. But obviously, it's not easy everyday to keep up the good habits. Anyway, the elementary/middle school was the worst period of my life, and I was decided not to be fucked up 3 mores years.I fought two times, once with a high school student for no real reason and second time with a random guy who tried to steal my phone on the street.I met a girl who was shy af, looked like me when I was young, lost in this school, wishing to get her diploma as fast as possible. When I spoke to her, she was surprised a man would find interest in her (other than she's the smart little girl who cries when we yell at her). *\[What I thought was love, was only compassion. But once again, I didn't know. Important sentence for the the final thoughts at the end\]*

I knew I had to leave my father's house ASAP, my studies were a total mess. I only thought about leaving the house, I lied about getting a diploma *\[Which is still never told to anyone\]* and looked for a job at 20yo.

I got my fake diploma in January 2nd. I left my father's house on January 7th. I lived at my gf's house for several months, then in September we went in our first flat as I was working since few months. *\[A good point is that I was not a fool, I managed in 1 year to make my manager leaving the team to get his job\].*

I left a note for my father saying I leave because of his drinking issues, but according to my brother and neighbors, they only thought I was manipulated by my gf.

My father never met his two grandchildren until this day, maybe a picture leaked from FB, but that's all.

\------

**6) The first day of the rest of my life**

So, until today. I tried to get back everything I didn't have in my childhood, watching movies I never seen, spending money for my happiness (Was hard to buy my Netflix subscription). I can't even hold a glass of alcohol in front of my children, I have a driving license since 2014 but I still drive like a teenager. Many reminders of my early life, not talking about the ""Hoo, I remember that candy when I was a kid, don't you ?"" No, I had no childhood.

I met my mother since I left the house, we discussed a lot and I decided she was a nice person, even if I'll never see her as a mother. She saw her grandchildren and is very happy, she even has news from my brother. The wheel of fortune reversed at her advantage.

I noticed I have severe self-esteem issue until today. My wife naturally adapted her behavior and know I'm like a child to her, she often yell for nothing, which should lead to an argue as a couple, but I still can't' do that. She wanted kids, I didn't, now we have 2 children.

About children. I love them both. Like really, since i'm a father I really want them to have a normal life, and being there for them when they will be sad. I sincerely do my best to give them a good education. The older one is at school now, and seems not to be shy at all even if he's 1year younger, he's full of energy and loves to play with me, he gets angry sometimes (when we serve green vegetables), something I almost never did, I guess that's a good point for him. The second one is still young today, but we found how to make her laugh, so everything is going well. I don't want to leave them alone as a was.

&#x200B;

But since I'm a father, I realized nobody else is of interest to me. Even myself, I still don't like to do things for me, like deciding where to go for holidays, or choosing a restaurant, etc. I know what I want, but I still can't say it out loud.

Even my wife, I have seen her as the path to escape my past life, and now the mother of my kids, no love involved. Tbh, she also has some troubles, she was a brilliant student and thinks she is ""superior"" to other people. And i'm not helping. So I often see my wife arguing with my kids when she is tired because he's making noises while playing with his toys. She usually sleep in the afternoon because at this time my son is tired too, and easily crying/yelling. Leaving me alone to deal with him. I sleep about 5hours per night, while she easily reach 12-13h since the Covid happened. And obviously, I'm getting grounded when  I do something she doesn't like (example, cooking pizza when she wants something else, but obviously, i'm not allowed to wake her up to ask)

My only wish is almost the same as always: Being alone, with myself... and my kids. My wife is a good reminder of that. She's the last thing from my past life.

**7) Final thoughts + Updates?**

Today I feel like an old man waiting for the cancer to kill him, while giving love to his kids/grandkids and totally not thinking about himself. I'm 27yo today. I don't want to change (I mean, seeing a psychologist) because I know I'd have to divorce if I want to heal properly (I need to be alone, that's the main condition for me to feel good). And I don't want my children to live this. I'll wait maybe 20-25 years (when they'll leave the house) to really decide if I want a good ending or a bad one. Being a father is something unexpected that will restraint my dark ideas for years. I love my children.

&#x200B;

I don't expect any answer, or just some grammar correction if someone else read that. This post is like a photo album, will come sometimes to remind me of some events, maybe I'll add updates next years or rewrite some chapters. Dunno yet."
LutzEgner,depression,1620594896.0,"I got told 'I love you' for the first time in my life, but it feels hollow.","All my life I have been longing for harmony in my social life, for a partner that understands me, just someone who loves me the way I simply am.

I am 33 years now and never really had a relationship. I can't count how often I have been rejected already. Almost always it is 'I don't want to risk our friendship, you are a  really cool dude' etc you know the drill.

I have been diagnosed with a severe Depression when I was 17.

I eventually through luck found a girl who liked me 6 years ago. Problem was she didn't live near me, thus eventually a long distance 'relationship' formed. We talked all day, how nice we found each other etc.

Then, out of the blue, one day her mother calls me crying, telling me that her daughter killed herself the day before. You can't even imagine how much that threw me off. There were no signs that she was suffering, she left no suicide note and to this day I still dont know why this person removed herself forcibly from my life.

My depression worsened and eventually (last year) it was so bad that I literally did  NOTHING for days. Not even getting food. I didnt pay my rent and got thrown out of my Apartment, making me a homeless person.

Thanks to my mother I got put in a psyvh ward last september, (it was my 5th visit in such an institution). They helped me get back atleast some money, helped me find a nice new flat of which I am very proud to have decorated. It is very cozy.



I also met a girl there. We instantly hit off, talked all day there. She was only a few days there, could go home eventually. I gathered all my courage and ask for her phone number, to my surprise she said she was about to ask the same. She instantly messaged me back, invited me to her place, cooked something for me, introduced her family to me as well. This continued over a month, long after I got out of the psych ward. I fell in love with her right there. The problem is, she is in a relationship.

Fast forward to today, its still the loving atmosphere when she is here, everything is nice. But I know its not genuine for some reason. Everytime I want to end the contact between us, I cant. I wanted to do it again, yesterday. She told me she loved me as well. I would die for that woman, I would really do, but something tells me it was just to keep me on 'the leash' if you know what I mean.

I don't want to badmouth her in any way, but I dont know what to do. My depression makes me think about her all day, I cant do anything about it.
Shouldn't it feel good if someone tells those words to you? To me it didn't.

I just feel so fucking lonely, I wish everything was true but in my heart I wish it isn't, and this destroy me. I just want everything to be good.


I am sorry this turned into a long rant, it helped me atleast."

My parents care about my grades then my mental or physical help. I love my parents a lot and there amazing in every cagegory except when it comes to school. I can’t live up to there expectations and I can’t stand that there so disappointed in me. I get grounded and lectured because I don’t get the best grades like I used too before online school. They always say “I know you can do better than this” but I really fucking can’t. Also I’ve been hopping schools do to bullying and covid which had made it really hard to meet friends that aren’t online. In the real world I’m completely alone because the only time I see my classmates is through a computer screen. But I have so many friends online and they make me happy. But whenever my parents get the slightest bit unhappy with me they shut off the WiFi entirely and cut all my social contact. This means it’s hard to keep plans and keep steady and realignment friends because no one knows when I’ll just be shut off without warning. I can’t explain al in detail but I help people with mental problems like anxiety and depression and talk with them like a junior therapist but they always give me all there problems to deal with and normally that’s fine I like to help people,  but recently it’s too much and I can’t handle all of there problems. But at the same time I can’t just ghost them because then they wouldn’t have any one to talk too, I feel like my life is so meaningless that my only purpose it to make sure others around me are happy, recently my parents have been more strict and I’ve spent less and less time with my friends which had brought back habits like cutting and not eating. I fell so lonely all the ducking time and my depression anxiety and ADHD are not making it any better. I can’t explain in full detail all the shit in my life that’s happening but a lot more than this. I’m really struggling to find a reason to get up every day. I am so fucking lonely and I just want some realll friends. What’s the point in living anyway if it’s just hell and pain until you die. I don’t understand I can’t take it any more, I see these people with perfect lives in the real  life and it fictional stories. if any lne sees this ill make another post and ask about other things but really just wanted to vent and ask for help.

Recibell,depression,1620484762.0,Lowest point,You can read thru my old post and see what I've been going thru but now my support group is gone bc of their own projections. I deleted my social medias bc of my narcissistic soon to be ex husband. I'm trying to work on myself but depression has me so down I haven't even made my bed. I'm at a loss. I'm overwhelmed at the desertion of everyone who says they love me leaving me. I have never been one to easily make friends bc I do not trust people at all. Walls are extremely high. I don't know what to do but I'm at the end of my hope.
EmbarrassingIdea,depression,1620445395.0,Am I actually depressed or just an edgy teen?,"So recently I’ve been feeling down. I just feel like my entire life is just constant stress, that no matter how much schoolwork I do, theres always more and its been putting a strain on me.
I also act differently around different friends and different when with family and I don’t know which is my actual self. I think I’ve just been fabricating personalities for so long that I forgot what my real one was.
And heres the depression part. Recently, whenever I am wrong or I don’t know how to do something, I’ll berate myself and convince myself that I’m useless. I considered suicide but thought that my parents would miss me. I also don’t know if my friends actually like me or if Im being clingy and they actually hate me but they are confrontational enough to tell me.
For an example of what I tend to do when I feel this way, yesterday, I couldn’t understand my homework, so I cried for thirty minutes, got a bloody nose and then told myself I was worthless. I don’t feel like I’m worth anything but the issue is, I don’t know if I actually believe that or if I’m just telling myself that to be edgy.

So thats the entire thing but I kinda need to rant, so I’ll add some things here but they’re not really relevant to my question. So I’m bisexual, I told my mom, step dad, brother, and grandma. I never told my dad and I don’t know why. So I’m also about 60% sure I’m genderfluid, but the last 40% is mainly because, like with my depression, I don’t know if its just a phase.


Sorry about this, this was mainly a rant and I have no idea if anyone can answer my question with this, so I’ll just to a tldr.

I think I’m worthless, useless, and that my friends hate me, but I don’t know if thats my actual thoughts or If im just being edgy."

gatorgirl84,depression,1620623137.0,I finally brushed my once beautiful hair and now it looks terrible!,"I've been unsuccessfully battling depression for some time. My waist length hair had become a matted gross mess after not brushing or washing it for 6+ months. I finally found the will and strength to get it all untangled. As soon as I started, I found myself excited and looking forward to having my hair back. My hair has always been thick and wavy with a tendency to frizz, especially in the summer. I'd wear it wavy/curly when it was humid out and straighten it during the drier months. I had good hair. It was difficult to manage but it was GOOD. I always got compliments on my hair, all my life. No matter what other insecurities I had with my body or appearance, my hair was always something I could depend on to give me a boost of confidence. 
It took me 6 days, 3 to 4 hours a day. I couldn't wait to wash it and trim the dead ends and have something to feel good about. After washing it last night I feel completely deflated. My hair looks terrible! It's almost like the top layer or two of hair all the way around my head has changed texture. It's really wiry looking. That's the only way I can really explain it. The hair doesn't lay together, it's almost like each strand is individually crinkled like frizz on steroids! I tried to straighten it but it hardly helped at all. It's from root to tip so it's not like I can cut it off. I don't know how to help/fix it and I'm trying so hard not to spiral but it's become increasingly difficult as the day has progressed. 

Has anyone else ever experienced this? Does it get better as I continue to care for it properly? It nearly sends me into a panic to think that the hair grew like this because of the way it was all tangled and matted and it's not going to get better until it grows out and I can chop it off. 

Please help!"

I haven’t left the house except for work and the color in the world that I saw during university life has pretty much entirely disappeared. The final nail in the coffin was when someone who I thought I was closer to shared a story on their snap of them at a party which was a party that I was not invited to, and was still going on. I have gone to exactly 0 parties in my lifetime, and I guess that number is gonna stay at 0 for a while longer. I don’t know if I even want to call him a friend anymore.

Bleshbelsh,depression,1620483159.0,I feel like I'm wasting people's time asking for support constantly,"TRIGGER WARNING: Mentions of self harm

I've been feeling so low these past few months. I am in therapy again and I feel like a major depressive episode is hitting again. I'm scared because my last one was so so tough to get out of.

I don't have any friends in the town I live in, but I know I'm lucky enough to have a few good friends abroad and in other cities. I just wish I had someone to hang out with physically.

I've been making myself seek support when I feel low, even though I feel so guilty when I do. Everyone's been so patient and my long distance boyfriend is the most amazing guy, but I feel like I'm just wasting his and people's time being so negative and needing so much support. It also feels endless... like I'm constantly not okay.

Sometimes my thoughts get so negative I feel like pulling all my hair out or smashing my head against a wall just so it all stops. Instead I've learned to just take really cold showers until I feel frozen and the pain of being so cold stops the emotional pain and I feel some relief.

I'm exhausted of feeling so tired and so low all the time and I'm scared that if I keep asking for support people will eventually get tired of me and leave just like most of them did when I was depressed last time. 

I don't even know why I typed all this, but it helped a little bit. Thank you for reading if someone did.

stonerisinthename,depression,1620605635.0,Advice Needed,"Hello everyone, I write this today seeking advice and hoping that one of you lovely people could point me in the right direction. So to set it up I’ve had some mental issues for a while. Going all the way back to high school I have self-worth/confidence issues. Last year around this time I moved four hrs from home to pursue a career as an Air Traffic Controller. I am currently two semesters in and I absolutely love it. When I moved I either developed or noticed that I have BED(Binge Eating Disorder). I never saw someone professionally about BED and I will still occasionally have episodes. The BED doesn’t bother me that much because I can counteract it by going on runs and hitting the gym often. Over the past 2-3 months I have been experiencing some symptoms of depression along with the BED. This weekend I haven’t left my house and haven’t touched the dishes. There’s also a list of things that need to be done that I havent touched. I think I’m in the worst mental state I’ve ever been in. 

With that being said, I know the correct course of action. Go seek professional help and talk to someone about this. I am reluctant to do so though because if diagnosed with any mental disorders my career as an air traffic controller will be finished, I would have wasted over 100,000$ of my parents and grandparents money and I feel like I would let my family down since they scarificed so much to put me in this position in the first place.

Any advice on my situation would be very much apppreactied. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"

Everyone that believes in God(s) says that we have to please them or we will live in eternal suffering, the big bang says that we were a mistake, and buddhism says that existence is nothing but eternal suffering.

All of these suck.

For a while I thought that there was never a beginning but if that were true than where's my purpose?

Is it just to suffer?

Is it to extend the life of my species by another generation?

Is it to make a difference?

Which makes me feel like I’m getting no air. Gives me no sleep. And makes me sad. And added to that is the virus of course. And my grandad being on the last few days of his life. All of this is just so much for me. I can’t have school as well that would just kill me. Like I just really want to pause everything I’m doing. Like I’m crying every night. And I’m just so sad. The doctors send me to a physician person. But I’m so unsure if it’s gonna help.
Ssaaado_Impacto,depression,1620422142.0,Should you want a relationship even if you're depressed ?,"Just a random thought I just had, really. I probably have depression, and I really really hate myself. But I also find myself fantasizing about having a girlfriend more and more, like, I'm starting to actively WANT to be in a relationship.

But the thing is, I also tried to follow the rule of "" loving yourself before you try to love someone else "" for a long time. And yeah, how could I actually love someone if I don't like myself ?

I don't know. It's like I am not even sure what it is I truly want. Do I :
A : Actually want someone to love 
or B : Do I just want to stop feeling lonely ? Do I just want to use a person to fill a void in my life ?

As much as I would love to believe it's the first option, the truth is it's probably the second one. And it makes me feel like such a scumbag, wanting to use people. And I hate myself even more.

But even if I know all this, at the end of the day, the desire of wanting a girlfriend is still here. So yeah. It's a vicious circle.

To some extent, it even applies to my friends, are my feelings of love and admiration for them genuine ? Or do I just like the fact that being with them is the only thing that makes me happy ?

How can you be so fucked up you don't even know how you, yourself feel about things anymore ?"

Masons_Redoubt,depression,1620439377.0,Going tonight.,"Long, dramatic read about my life ahead of you. Also wrote this on mobile so sorry for the format and mistakes 

Note: I posted this on r/suicidewatch just now as well, and figured that this would probably be a community that would resonate with some of what I said here too.


I'm tired of living my life. I feel like I've tried so many different times to change who I am. To catch up. To be a person who can speak coherently. To be a person who can be interested in things and put effort into them. To be a person who takes care of themselves. To be a person at all really. Haven't gotten anywhere in what feels years.

For context, I used to be pretty happy and on a good track when I was really young (4-10 years old). I had good friends, did well in school etc, but then I had to be fucking stupid and prioritize video games/internet over everything else. I started pretending I was sick and did everything I could during 5th grade to stay home and be on my computer, and for some reason, be it anxiety or charitablility/empathy, my mom played into it and let me do it. Eventually, It got out of control and there was a period where I got pneumonia and lobbied my parents to let me stay home for weeks which put me in a shitty position with the school I was going to. But that's okay! My mom has a solution. Online homeschool.

I think online homeschool can be done well and I don't think my mom was malicious. I truly and honestly think she wanted the best for me, but fuck me this was this not the way to go. I stayed at home every day all year round while, submerged my self in all sorts of media and, on a more positive note, did good with the little amount of school work I had to do. but most importantly I isolated myself in my room, and didn't talk to anyone for large periods of times, not even people online. I feel like this messed with my psyche a lot. I mean, imagine next to no experiences (in the form of personal ones, not learned ones) from the ages of 11-14. Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is, but either way, that period of my life has shaped me into the absolutely worthless fucking human being I am now. 

I've tried going back to school in person multiple times in middle school, and now highschool, and It's not worked out too well. I just can't effectively communicate ideas talking to people, and I struggle a lot with figuring out what people mean in writing and when they're speaking to me. I'm overall really stupid and lazy because of the lack of challenge I've had throughout my entire, even before I went to online homeschool, but I've gotten really good at gaming academics and speak in stilted language so a lot of people at my school and my age in general think I'm smart, in that sort of stereotypically autistic way. It's cringe, I'm cringe and so many of my interactions as result are very awkward. I genuinely hate myself too, I mean really hate myself, and it's done me 0 favors since now I have a much more negative identity which makes me want to be a edgelord. And usually I temper myself, but it's become much more difficult in the past year due to being right back in the same situation I was before in online school with covid and all, and of course that's caused my mental health to decline drastically. Leading me to the present actually.

If you haven't noticed too, there are a lot of details I've been leaving out and gaps in my recantation, and it's due to a lot of factors, but primarily depression and ???????. I have this sort of bizarre pesudo-state way of describing what happens in my mind, and it makes formulating what I feel into words fairly difficult, since if I stated it the way I usually think about it would soubd very strange and like I was talking about some sort of fantasy government, which it is. The other major reason is because my memory and ability to recall events has been damaged by depression and anxiety, which I've struggled with for years along all the other bullshit I've managed to do to myself. Point of all this being that this might all seem strange. (I'm not autistic by the way). Anyway on to the part that makes this post appropriate for the subreddit.

I'm 16 years old right now, and I'm going to kill myself tonight because I'm tired of the things I put myself through, and my repeated inability to deal with them. My parents are going away, and I have everything I need to pass peacefully and cleanly. I love my parents, but I don't want them to see me when I eventually become the deadbeat dipshit that I feel like I'm doomed to become if I keep living. I'm sorry for what they'll go through and I'm sorry for everyone I'll hurt. But this cannot go on anymore. I'll be here for a few hours after I post this, and then I'm attempting.

LucienDragunov,depression,1620620503.0,Man these episodes suck,"Been dealing with depression for quite a long time. When it hits it’s usually a slow burn but then it lingers for days. These past 6-7 months I’ve been trying to not usually give into the thoughts or low emotions. I’d write in a journal, exercise as much as I can, focus on a positive goal, not stay in my head most importantly but I’m having one of those weeks where I’m super stuck. I’m not open about it with many people since it’s a recurring theme in my life and I don’t want to talk if nothing is really helping me. At most I just push people away or just shut the world out when I get caught up in it

I basically suffer in silence. the reason I’m writing this is that the suicidal thoughts crept in once again. I’m a cutter but haven’t had that episode in over a year. That’s how I usually visualize it, long for results. Another way is just thinking of how life would be without me. I quit drinking 3 1/2 months ago so I’m just feeling all of the emotions with nothing to numb it. Actually that would make it worse. Just hoping it passes sooner than later but for now I’m in it deep. The hope factor is getting slim but I’ll keep going as best as I can."

My relationship with my mom where sometimes i want to hang out with her like a normal mom, and sometimes i never want to see her again.

LoopingLou0306,depression,1620517082.0,I am a bad person but I don't want to be.,"This might be a long post.

In my life betrayal has been the norm.  My first memory is being beaten by my father while I was so young that I couldn't even roll over. So I have pain at the very center of my soul.  

Both of my parents abused drugs, along with me and my siblings. My mother wouldn't spank me, quite often she would punch me because I'm male. 

She would constantly start physical fights with my father, and she would use random objects as weapons. (She initiated almost ALL of the physical fights with my father).

After my dad left, things got worse.  My siblings and I would sometimes go days without supervision or food because my mother was out feeding her addiction, and my father was completely absent.

After moving in with my maternal grandmother, the physical abuse stopped, but I had to suffer near constant psychological abuse for being male.  My grandmother HATED men, and would constantly gas light me and take advantage of me.  

(Example: I was taught that a ""good man"" pays bills.  So I was forced to get a job under the table washing cars, and almost ALL of my money went to support the household...I was 12)

She would tell me to my face that I was basically expendable. ""Walk to the store and grab (x). I can't send your sister's because they might be kidnapped or raped."" 

She would let my mother back into the house periodically while I was at school. So, I would come home, and all of my game consoles would be gone, sold for drug money.  When I objected to my mother having access to the house, I was called a psychopath (she even compare me to Charles Manson).

When I started dating the gas lighting became worse. I ended up with a complete narrcists (because that was my ""normal""). When I tried asking for advice on how to deal with my then girlfriend, I was always met with one piece of advice, ""Get used to it. That's just normal behavior.""

This girl did a number on me, she physically abused me, and cheated on me. Again, when asking for advice (even from people who weren't in my family) I was told that I just didn't understand girl behavior.  Her actions weren't ""bad"" or ""evil"", I was just misinterpreting them.

By the time I was in my early 20s her and I had two children. She was an awful mother, constantly using my kids to manipulate me. When I finally had enough, I moved out and met the woman who would become my ex-wife.

Her emotional abuse was more subversive. She would refuse even the smallest request that I made of her. She would constantly do things like; pick at my skin whenever we were close (even during sex), refuse to shower and then demand sex, attempt to manipulate me into not hanging with my friends by accusing me of cheating, or set up shit to tests so that I could prove that I loved her.

I felt like I couldn't leave her I wanted to give my kids a stable environment to grow up in...well at least more stable than my family was.

After a few years of this I snapped.  I noticed a commonality between the behavior of all of the women that abused me, and built a psychological profile that allowed to me manipulate women. (At least women with a similar profile to my abusers)

I was able to use that model to accurately predict the behavoir of my mother, wife, and many other women.  Then I became extremely toxic. I decided to put my model to the test and began testing it by sleeping with MANY women. I justified this because all of the girls that I had dated used sex to force compliance. 

I would see some of the same egocentric narrcisim that my female abusers displayed, so I didn't feel sorry for any of them. To be honest, it really hurt me too.

First, it violated my own sense of right and wrong. Before I snapped I had only been with a total of 3 women, and 2 of them were long term monogamous relationships.

Second, with every woman I slept with, I could feel my bias and disdain grow larger, and larger.  I was very angry that being honest and direct seemed to a suboptimal strategy for dealing with romance.

I came to a terrible conclusion that in this world, you're either predator or prey.  

So I'm left in a place where I cannot trust. I have sworn off romantic interactions because I can't make sense of them.

I know that I hurt a lot of people, including my children.  I feel the worst for them, because they didn't deserve it at all. Only the very worst people hurt the innocent, and that's what I did.

It feels like everything is awful. 

Expecting monogamy seems extremely foolish, and sleeping with multiple women is dangerous and irresponsible.

It feels like there are NO good choices. Theres no way to be good. If you're honest you're taken advantage of and it hurts.  If you're dishonest you can take advantage of others, but that hurts too.

I dont know what to do, or how to think. I have no idea how to define ""good behavior"". I can create effective strategies, but that's not the same thing and being a good person.

I know that what I've done is awful, but I have no idea how to be ""good""...."

The only future I had was lookkng forward to a life with my boyfriend, but that's not going to happen anymore. We still live together, and he is moving his new boyfriend in with us. He says he still loves and cares for me, but not like ""that"" anymore. I left before, I actually did but I came back because I thought we were going to try to make it work. We have 2 dogs and a cat. I keep telling myself, that it's better if I stay here to take care of them. But whenever I sleep I keep forcing myself to believe this life is a dream and whatever I wake up to is my real life. I tried to jump of a bridge, but it just ended up scratched and bruised. I work 2 jobs now since the pandemic. I tell people asking why I have to jobs that I just want more money and take advantage of working from home. I tried to believe that too. But I think I'm just trying to exhaust myself until I can't do anything anymore. I'm HIV positive. One of the times that my boyfriend had been seeing another person, I looked for those massage therapists and had sex. I'm not sure that's where I got it, but I have it now.  I am taking meds but I'm tired of it. And oh yes, throughout the the entirety of our relationship my boyfriend cheated on me a lot of times. I tried to stab myself in the heart with a knife before, but I did it slowly and stopped because it hurt. Now I'm suffering some thyroid issue I'm not sure where or how I got and trying to get treated for it. So my no longer boyfriend's sister is here with her bf visiting. So there's 5 of us in the house. They left for the province 2 days ago and I was left by myself here because I have work. It felt lonely and freeing at the same time. Now they're back. I was dozing off and getting the feeling that I was about to dream, then they knocked on the door. I was just really hoping that the dream I was having was my ""real"" life and this was the dream now nightmare that I need to wake up from. But they knocked, and now I'm awake and making this post.

I'm sorry if my sentences and thought process are jumbled, I'm not usually like this. But I just really wished that I ""woke"" up from this dream to my real life and now everything feels heavy."
Marescio,depression,1620517070.0,"To those that went through therapy / meds / both, were finished with them and came out the other end successfully, how long did it work for you? Because after a couple of years I'm relapsing hard.","Bacially, what the title says. Went through several therapists, a venlafaxine dose of 300mg for some time, and things seemed to get better. Didn't have much to talk about anymore at my sessions eventually, so we decided it had been enough. I was glad to not have to worry anymore about taking my meds on time. I got a well paying job, and recently even moved into a new place. But it doesn't matter I guess, because now, several years after therapy, I feel like I'm in it all over again. Same depression and suicidal thoughts. Has anybody had a similar experience? Or did it work out better for you?

I really, really don't want to through all of it again."

I have a constant feeling of dread and anger for this but I keep me self at bay by playing video games and watching movies (which at times just annoys me). All I can do is fucking wait,wait,wait and wait some more so that the doctor knows what the fuck is going on inside my body and why I’m taking three meds every day.

Arsenalg0d,depression,1620510130.0,feeling selfish for having emotions,"lately my depressions been p. bad, but i was really looking forward to meeting up with this dude i really liked, it was scheduled for today. we were gonna meet up at 12.

 10am, no response. 

11am, no response. 

12.... still not answering my texts.

 *two hours* after our original time he texts me saying he couldn't make it b/cuz he had a cold. thats ok, i just wish he'd told me sooner instead of waiting so long, i had everything planned out too! and that was that. no rescheduling. he didnt bother to talk to me anymore. i gave him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he was just in bed resting and didnt wanna talk about when we could reschedule... no, he's been in a call with my other friends for the past few hours.

i feel like shit, like this is all somehow my fault, and i'm selfish for being mad. after all, it's not his fault he's gotten sick, especially w the pandemic and all, its good he didn't show. im just tired of never getting what i want i guess. i just wanna be happy"
CarlosMartinEdward,depression,1620641612.0,"I can't seem to ever think of myself as a ""good person"". (Tw: self-hatred)","Whether it's due to past actions, thoughts or feelings, there's always something to taint how I view myself.

Sometimes it's stupid, trivial stuff I mess up in my day-to-day life or memories of dumb things I did as a child. Other times, it's a political stance that I should know better about or be in agreement with but for some reason l don't, a bad habit that I know I should change and the fact that I refuse dictates my character, my emotional immaturity and sexual frustration that makes me think I shouldn't be craving a partner, let alone looking for one. All these reasons, either by themselves or in conjunction, are always hammering in my head the judgement that I'm just... not a good person.

But what does that even mean? What defines these metrics of ""good"" and ""bad"" personhood? It's certainly not a standard I hold other people by, so why do I do it to myself? Why do I think of myself differently from everybody else? Are my mistakes any different from everyone else's? At first glance that would obviously be false, but it all comes crashing down when I ask: if they are truly mistakes, why do I keep repeating them? Why don't I learn from them? Why do I keep going down paths I know to be wrong?

Why do I not change?

That's where my innocence dies. At the accusation that my errors aren't accidental, but deliberate. That I consciously choose to continue doing what I know it's bad for me, or maybe even others, but I'm either too deep in a comfort zone to be bothered or make up excuses to avoid what, by my own stabdards, is a moral imperative.

And so I apologize. Over and over. Out loud. Everytime something like this crosses my mind, I let out a single ""I'm sorry!"", or perhaps several in succession. At first it was just in my head, then it evolved to whispering, now it's either a full on vocal burst or an anxious mantra I find myself enunciating several times a day. But am I really sorry? Sorry for what? Do I regret being who I am or am I just excusing the call out? How can I be sorry if I can't seem to ever take responsibility, even for what's in my head?

It's like I actually want this.

But I don't. I mean... I want to think I don't. Yet I still can't shake the feeling that I deserve it. That I chose this life, this mindset, and therefore I need to just shut up and deal with it. How can I ask for help if this is my own fault? How can I ask for help if I refuse to change? How dare I ask for help if I did this on purpose?

Suddenly, what seemed to be minor revealed a potential side of me that's... ugly to look at. A side I feel has no place in this world. I may avoid it all I want, but it's always there, lurking, and every deviation reminds me of it.

Some tell me I should just put in an effort and change. Others say I need to just accept it as a part of me and move on. These two stances seem to be in direct contradiction of one another, and I'm constantly battling between the two. Nothing is as black and white as I make it out to be, which is ironic given the title of this post. I have yet to find out how to effectively break my cycle of self-hatred. I know that wouldn't magically solve my issues, but at least I would not deliberately make it all worse. Handle things for what they are, and not as a mirror of my worst self.

I don't know what being a good person even is anymore, or if that's who I should be. I just don't want to be the bad person I fear and hate so much."
chriis2021,depression,1620559140.0,Is your depression caused by peoples who constantly act badly to you ?,"Every one i met look at me badly and be agressive to me.

I just can t walk peacefully without someone stare at me or come to me agressvely like he want fight me, get nervous next to me. I can t walk in a street without someone 20meters away stare at me stupidly until i pass him.

Litterally every people make me angry face when i look at them and get stressed or look back at me agressively.

Bubbly_Lime-666,depression,1620498321.0,My anti depressants are ruining me.,I’ve been through the ringer when it comes to anti depressants. I’ve been on and off of them since 13 I’ve tried so many I don’t even count anymore but I’m currently struggling with one huge issue I also face. My libido. I have no sec drive... zero. I don’t even want to think about it because it almost grosses me out and makes me feel awkward. This just recently started about 3 years ago and I’ve been struggling with it since.
meandmyfeelings,depression,1620553082.0,I will die soon,I will die in a few days because when I got poisoned from a wound it was a small wound but poisoned when I told my parents that i feel to go to hospital my father said its nothing don't worry and now here I am dying slowly a week after i told them i am just sad for my parents my mom hates my dad now my dad trying to visit me but he don't know how he will see me he think all of that was because of him i just wanted to have my last days happy not like this
EatFast_SkateAss,depression,1620593331.0,My Heart Aches,"I'm so sad, I've been so sad for years. I wish I could die without killing myself. I'm tired of taking care of this stubborn body, of trying. I just want to sleep. I'm only 23 and I so badly want to get better but this feeling is always creeping under my skin. I wish I was beautiful and deserving of love. I'm made up of only jagged pieces, chaos, I am a disaster."
Throwaway31273891,depression,1620532880.0,Im thinking of ending things,"I know theres a a good chance that nobody reads this. But writing these kinds of things helps even if only a little bit so I dont really give a shit. I am currently 16 years old and extremely fucking lonely. I do have a group of friends but Im starting to feel like Im not hanging out with them because I actually enjoy their company, but because It takes my mind off of all the shit that I think about when im alone. And I'm afraid that if I leave that group of friend I will legitimately hurt myself. Half the time when Im with them Im not even socializing, I just feel like Im gonna say the wrong thing and embarrass myself. 

 My uncle commited suicide when I was younger, I was only 6 years old at the time and I dont really have any memories of him. But ever since I was a child I have been told by my family that I resemble him extremely. To the way I sit, the way I act and look, pretty much anything you can think of. This has me wondering if it was meant to be. 

I take drugs almost every day. Mostly Mariljuana as in the state I live in you can get it almost anywhere, and nobody gives a shit if you smoke. However I've started vaping, drinking, and taking LSD. As emo as this may sound I take them to help numb my mind. So far the only one that can succeed in that consistently is alcohol. But that shits hard to get. I feel like I don't want to take drugs, half the time they just make me feel like shit. But as mundane and tedious as my life is I feel like it just gives me something interesting to do. 

I've been neglected by my parents ever since I was a child. And honestly I don't blame them. Actually I should say that I don't blame my mom. Because she has an excuse. Her excuse is she is always working constantly. Because she's a CEO. My father on the other hand has no excuse, I feel like he never spent any time with me. I have very certain memories from my time as a toddler. Nothing much just snippets or images here and there. But now that I'm thinking about it the only ones that I really have of my father are when he got mad at me for whatever it was I did as a dumb fucking toddler. And to this day whenever I try and spend time with him I can tell that he's trying to end it as soon as possible. And go back to whatever it was he was doing before. He never beat me physically, and I congratulate him for that. And all things considered he's not that bad and I could've had it way worse. A lot of people do. But I would be lying if I said he didn't play a part in my depression. The worst part is that I know if I make it to adulthood, and if I decide to have kids, I'm going to be way worse than he was. 

I feel like I can't tell anyone about my depression. One day at school we had a speaker come in to our class and talk to us about poetry. And how he found purpose in life through poetry and music. Our assignment for that day was to write a poem that started with the line ""when I write..."" I decided to take this opportunity to talk about my depression. And basically went on a two page poetic rant about basically all the bullshit that I'm writing about now. And how badly I wanted to kill myself. I turned it in, half expecting to get referred to the student councilor or a therapist of whatever the fuck. When I received the poem back with my grade the next day. I saw nothing but comment from my teacher along the lines of ""wow this is really great!"" or ""I'm speechless."" That was a huge slap in the face. I received no help whatsoever.

This post was a fucking long one so If you even read the entire thing thank you. I apologize if It go too angsty or emo. I just feel like I had to get all this shit off my chest and writing these sorts of things kind of helps"

Mew-Poke,depression,1620596311.0,Tired of giving unconditional love and kindness only to be hurt in the end,"I’m just so exhausted being the “kind, patient, and understanding” friend only to be shoved to the side as an afterthought. I guess it’s my fault for being too loving and people taking advantage of that.

I have a friend who moved across the country and has been struggling mentally and financially without any family or friend support there. And because she’s one of my (what I thought) best friends I’ve been there for her every single day since she’s moved there. Being supporting, caring, and trying to comfort the loneliness she was facing there. Even when I had a long exhausting days at work I would come home to FaceTime with her or play video games when she asked so she wouldn’t be sad.

I even spent $400 on flight tickets to visit her this month to make sure she’s doing mentally okay only for her to start ghosting me the past four weeks with no explanation. I’ve been so worried she hurt herself and tried to reach out to make sure she was alive and okay only to get no response or barely a sentence.

Found out recently she stopped talking to me over a girl she’s trying to date. It hurts so much because she couldn’t even tell me she just dropped our entire friendship and I had to find out through social media. I’ve always been so empathetic and understanding to my friends only for them to hurt me in the end. Maybe I keep befriending the wrong people or try to find the best in others, but god it hurts to be treated like this."

I hate the dog so much yet I am expected to care for it? Fuck that. 

Not to mention that everyone thinks that the dog is better. How? My cat actually cuddles with you and didn't get aggressive or too hyper when you played with him. Yet this shitty dog runs away when anyone but my dad touches him and intentionally tries to piss everyone off. Yeah that's totally 100% better.

What pissed me off the most is when I mentioned that it had been 1 year since my cat died they all laughed and asked me why I still cared. I'm going to end up killing the shitty dog so I can laugh at them when they're crying. 

I know that this has got a bit violent but it's just how I feel at the moment and I had to vent."

I'm afraid that I might end up killing myself but I don't want my siblings to see the weak me, in a state where I'm just lying dead in front of them. A lifeless body who can't fight anymore.

But, how much do I have to wait? I guess It's correlative with the work I put on things to be better, but I've got the deep and sad feeling that I will spend the rest of my life worried, anxious, always working, always alone and always trying instead of just having fun and being happy. I know happiness is not a perpetual state, I only want to really enjoy this short life that is been gave to humans just for an instance. I'm patience, time just looks so short.

What did I on this week? Fucking nothing. I've barely got out of my apartment - only to get booze. I've slept - like a lot, 12-14 hours per day. I've played shitty PC games that I've already played thousand times. I've wanked. That's it. 

Such a fucking waste of time and opportunity. I dont even know what to do anymore to feel atleast semi-okayish. I know I have to sit and get through my issues, set some tasks and goals. I just fucking cant. I know that at this point I HAVE to go to a doctor with worsened depression, but I just fucking cant. There is no ""support group"" when you are in prolonged depression - everyone is just get tired at some point and stop reaching out for you. Even parents. Girlfriend left in October unable to deal with my ""passivity"" and ""amorphousness"" anymore. I cant even blame them all at all. 

I tried to quit drinking - but when I sober (like now) it becomes unbearable. ""Nothing is good"". 

I dont even know what to say to a doctor. ""Sir, I've been depressed my whole life, and now as 30 y.o. I feel as if I might be vanishing"".

I dunno if it's just the events anxiety making me overthink everything. I was wondering if anyone else gets like this. I haven't been with a psychiatrist for long and so far they've just said I've got 'emotional regulation problems', 'anxiety', 'depression' and 'disassociation problems'"

This was the weekend where I gave myself time. I just wanted to play guitar all weekend and learn more. What happened? I played games until 4PM. Said I'd practise guitar the rest of the day. Did some basic warmups then laid down as the depression took hold.

I wish I could say this was new but this is with anything. Anything I try the depression just seeps in and regulates my progress back.

I'm just thinking of my ex again. It sucks without you even though you ghosted 2 years ago I know your birthday is coming up. And you don't care how I felt about you. You had this in mind - to remove me from your life after 8 years. You just pretended and gritted your teeth through it until someone else better came along I guess.

Who am I kidding? I'd be the same fuck up I was without depression. A loser.

16liinesandimfine,depression,1620507162.0,"Suicidal, xanax, boyfriend finding out","So i told my boyfriend about my drug problem (Xanax) because that is honestly the only thing that helps with my Borderline Personality Disorder.

It makes me numb, careless and not a worry in  the world. I don´t care what happens to me or anyone in my surroundings. Finally a empty shell, which is such a relief. For the first time im not all over the place. Not as many suicidal thoughs, but sometimes they still appear.

So he spent the day with me today, and he kept track, so apparently i take 1mg about every 1.5 hours which adds upp to alot per day.

I don´t want to quit these pills since i´ve struggled with bpd and suicidal thoughts for years, and now it´s finally under control-

But he just got upset at me and said that if i do not stop taking them we can not continue the relationship.

SO eather me (a person with bpd so obviously super scared of losing someone) keep taking the pills and just be an empty shell with nobody in my life to love, or be loved by. 

Or i stop taking them and start self harming and thinking about suicide 10h a day.

And i´m ´´high´´ writing this post, because i got extremely anxious and im flooded with suicidal thoughts. 

So to sum this up, no matter what i do i´ll just end up dead.. Better to get it over with sooner rather than later i suppose."
Which-Holiday9957,depression,1620625045.0,I used to at least want to help people,"Maybe I just wasn’t depressed before. I feel like the last 8 years has been a slow decline in empathy and a surge in depression. 

I used to think I was an “empath” when I was younger and that the sadness I felt was connected to everyone else. The past few years especially I have noticed just how selfish I’ve gotten. Maybe it’s more jealousy than anything? 
But now it’s so hard to feel bad for anything and anyone because of the way I feel I guess. 
I feel like when I’m truly sad, not angry or jealous I feel way more depressed for the general state of everyone I see. 

But when I get angry I don’t care about anyone else or I have to force myself. Is that even part of depression or something else."

scatelo,depression,1620616032.0,Tips to deal with initial suicidal thoughts while adjusting to antidepressants?,"It's easy to find info about why some people experience an increase in suicidal thoughts while first adjusting to a new antidepressant, but not so much how to cope. Does anyone have any tips on how to get through it? 

I was previously on Prozac for a few months and had an increase in suicidal thoughts at the beginning stages and after I got off (I got off because the physical symptoms were too much, and I really didn't feel any better at all). It's been a few months and I'm still in the worst depression I have experienced thus far in my life, and my therapist recommended I try meds again so my doctor prescribed me Lexapro. I'm about to start taking it but am really scared that I will have an increase in suicidal thoughts while I adjust. I know it will likely pass/get better after a few weeks, but I'm not sure how much that knowledge will help me get through it. 

One thing that will be different is that I was mostly living alone (with minimal outside contact bc covid) when I was on Prozac, whereas I am now living with my mom - complicated relationship, but I think living alone did not help suicidal tendencies. I guess I'm looking for suggestions of that nature (but more easily done than a move haha) that I can do to push through any potential crises, or just generally if anyone has any experiences of a similar nature that they think might help. Thank you!"
just-another-mammal,depression,1620631744.0,Bought beer today,"I don't like the taste of alcohol, and have a sensitive stomach, which makes me buying beer have no logical value whatsoever.

If you look at my post history (yes I am self conscious, just like you) you can see that I am supposed to have spent my last dollars on drugs (I could of meant alcohol in the post I am talking about, but it wasn't) and no this isn't at all a covered post begging for money, I just like venting and posting to my own profile doesn't help in same the way.

Anyway, my mom sometime buys me those big water bottle that need you to have a water machine (is that how they are called in english?) and you can go to pretty much any convenience store and you get 10 bucks for the empty water bottle (the full one cost 5.99 more, and filling your empty one also cost 5.99) anyway, I was fully aware I didn't have that 6 bucks for a full water bottle and decided to buy a 6-pack of beer with the 10 bucks instead.  

I am currently urinating way too much, having watery stool and having a bloated stomach with no ""safe"" water supply to replace my lost fluids, which is entirely my fault and was a possibility I took into consideration buying beer instead of just water (you can still buy a decent amount of water with 10 bucks, just a LOT less than what is inside those big water bottle, 18 liters)

and I currently hate myself for having made this decision, I am not blaming anyone except me, I can admit there was a whole 30 minute I felt great because of the alcohol, which would not have happened with just water. Its just that I hate that somehow I chose that tiny timeframe where the pain will be eased knowing the pain will be worse than usual for the next day or two, hunger is manageable, thirst isn't, but I don't trust my tap water (even thought I will have to ""trust"" it eventually)

I don't like my life, no, I don't like *living*, I don't like myself, my decisions, my regrets after any bad decision knowing fully I knew about the regret I would have, I don't like that I live with about less than half what the poverty line is, even with higher education than most have (I live in canada if anyone is wondering at this point).

Where is the medical aid for dying to those in constant *psychological* pain? why do people still need a permanent *physically* painful illness to win the euthanasia lottery?

Fearless-Physics,depression,1620496524.0,"I feel like an egoistic piece of shit when my depression holds/prevents me from doing certain things, especially things for someone else","I normally don't see things in in myself that aren't how I am - neither on the good nor on the bad side - but I have this... deep inner fear that I might be an egoist, or egoistic to some degree. I wouldn't call myself an egoist, actually much more the opposite of that... but for example right now: Tomorrow, I was planning to get flowers for my mother for mother's day, and I just saw my mother in the kitchen packaging gifts for her mother and mother in law - actual gifts, I think fragrances (fragrances seem to be like the standard gift it seems...) [Due to corona related reasons I'm currently staying with my parents, and my both grandmothers are here too].

I instantly felt like a bad son, because I was ""only"" gonna get flowers for her... Now the shops are closed and I wanna get something more on monday. I could've bought something for her this whole week though...

I'll get to thr point. What I wanna say is that my circle of... well, all the things surrounding depression or that come with it, like... repeating routine of work, sleep and trying to/having to distract myself from the real world to just cope, that makes me forget about a lot of things, and puts my time management, general management of important things including appointment and stuff, any many many more things into a non-existent-state. It ends up so bad that I even forget important things about people around me that are important to me. Anf that's ahen I feel even worse... like a piece of shit. That stupid evil voice in my head tells me that I'm not a good human because I don't even care about them properly. I'm barely even managing to mentally support myself, I'm having real difficulties with this...

I imagine it would be even much worse if I had a lot of good friendships - good at least to the degree that you'd gift each other birthday presents. I would like to make everyone happy who means something to me and who I like, and if I was just fine I would certainly not restrain from spending time to think about what someone could like or what could make someone happy. It's just that... I can't hold it up. I'm constantly sinking and feeling bottom level down in this vicious circle of hell myself... I don't feel like I have the time to deal with things like this. And that's eyactly the point where I combat myself. That's the reason why I feel like shit. Because I actually do have the time, ""of course I have the time to think about what kind of present would be a happy little surprise to my mother, who I love, for mother's day, I would be a bad person if I didn't"", it's just that I can't and I beat myself up even more for it...

Spirited-Catch-2834,depression,1620547862.0,(23 F) I love the Superjail Warden/Mark Davis (47 M) but there's a very small chance we'd meet in person and it friggen hurts 😭,"So I'm prone to...being really in love with people to the point it clouds my judgement. There's this person (Mark Davis) (M, 47) I've been fixated on since around 2015. It's like when I saw him, there was this instant bond.

Ever since, it's like I HAVE to learn everything about him, even the most minute detail like his favorite color, what his medical history is, details about his job (Prison Warden) his political views, everything, sexual orientation, and they're quite similar to mine. When I found out what his full name was, I was literally giddy and in a daze for a couple days.

Just seeing the videos he's made makes me happy, I can be really stressed out or just feeling depressed, or anxious. But then he makes me feel better. I just love how dorky he is, I think he's absolutely adorable and he's always so lively..

I haven't met him in person yet, but I realllyyy hope to eventually. He isn't exactly a friendly person all of the time, he can be an asshole to people at times. I remember impulsively going full-hate mode on him when he said that he hated children. Then I snapped out of it..But I'm still attached to him and sometimes he even finds his way into my dreams then I get upset because it seems real.

He comes into my mind several times a day, like during dinner time I think, hmm I wonder what he's eating for dinner, or wondering when he's got home from work, when he'll be sleeping and then imagining him nice and comfy in bed. I wonder how he's doing right now.

I often wonder what he'd think of current events, or what answers he'd have to some questions I'd ask him.

I've repeatedly had these horrible nightmares where I'll dream that he died and I'd wake up literally sobbing, if he died I can't imagine how depressed I'd feel. Even now when I'm imagining him dying I literally feel physically sick to my stomach. I feel like if he died I'd have a nervous breakdown and I feel like crying right now just because I'm having to even bring that up. He's had no new videos since 2014 and I keep getting paranoid wondering if he's okay.

Problem is...I have no way of directly contacting him and I'm not even sure if he'd want me as a friend or not. I don't know what to do and I don't feel like I want to discuss this with a doctor because I'd seem crazy and stalker-ish. I sort of consider him as... a friend? Almost. I'm depressed and feel like if I met him in person and we spoke, I'd feel much better"

cinnamon9irl,depression,1620638610.0,how do i help my mum? tw: suicidal thoughts!!,"i need advice for how i can help my mum. 

some back story: my mum has dealt with abuse her whole life. she was abused by her parents, and then she dealt with abuse from my narsassistic dad, her ex partner. recently, she left him for the sake of my sister and i, because he was severely impacting our mental health. she has mentioned attempting suicide once before to me. it happened before she had me and my sister. 

we live in a small house now, and i think it has hurt her pride a lot. we were just cut off income support, she's unemployed and child support is barely enough for us to get by. yesterday was mothers day and she suddenly burst into tears, saying she had failed us and she was a bad example, and that everyone looked down on her. i've only seen my mother cry maybe 5, 6 times so it was really scary. 

today, she was talking to me about how she can't find a job. i told her not to give up, and that eventually she will find work again. she just has to stay strong. she says to me ""yeah, i guess i will. hopefully i find a job soon. or else i guess i'll just kill myself."" i know it sounds off handed but she has never said anything like that to me before, and she isn't the type of person to say something like that flippantly. i must have looked worried, she said soon after ""i take it back. of course i wouldn't kill myself. where would you two go? i can't leave you with your dad."" i can't really remember what else she said, but she said some more scary things.

she hasn't been herself lately. she's always angry, and complaining and i feel like i've been walking on eggshells trying to make her happy. it's also had a really bad effect on me. i feel everything she feels. i can't be happy unless she's happy. i am also dealing with suicidal thoughts. my reason for staying alive is pretty much the same as hers. i can picture how wrecked she would be if i did it, and thats what keeps me going. i don't know why i included that, but i guess i needed to let it out. 

sorry for the trauma dumping besties i really apologise, i just don't know what to do. i feel so lost. i've suggested therapy to her but she won't even consider it. i don't know how to help her.

In either case I'd love to hear feedback on how this is different from (or matches) your own experiences. 

---

In this final post of my check-in miniseries, I’ll begin delving into the topic that motivated me start writing: supporting people who are living with depression. First, I should add a disclaimer that’s surely obvious: kittenfarts.com is not a peer-reviewed psychiatric journal. Everything here is anecdotal; it’s based on the things I’ve learned over many years while trying and failing to navigate depression and the things I noticed when friends and family tried and failed to get through to me.

The tone here will be more serious than before. Supporting a friend or loved one who’s struggling with depression can feel like putting together a puzzle using the unprinted side. And worse, it’s too easy for our intentions and our words to be misread—or even vilified—by the effects of depression. Showing someone you care shouldn’t ever make things worse, but depression doesn’t answer to sensible assumptions. We’re going to have to understand what’s going wrong in order to be better than just sensible.

Let’s start by looking at a few of the symptoms of depression (major depressive disorder) listed by mayoclinic.org:

Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort
Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters
Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame
I don’t think I need to spend much time explaining why the first two items on that list make things difficult. If someone is feeling drained, or if they’re prone to anger, irritability, and frustration, the margin for error in a sensitive conversation is much smaller. Say one wrong word (or not enough of the right words) and the defensive walls will be raised. Despite that, I think it’s the final item on the list that we need to carefully work on. When someone is feeling worthless, when they’re feeling guilty or dealing with self-blame, it’s easy and natural for that person to assume the rest of the world sees them through that same judgmental lens. If we want to actually help, it’s critically important that we take the time to counter those feelings.

Why? Those feelings lead to or aggravate other symptoms and secondary emotions. And unlike with many of the more physical or chemical effects of depression, we can actually make a tangible difference. We can’t effectively counter most of the effects of depression for someone else. We can be loving and supportive. We can be good listeners. We can be there to help make the bad stuff more manageable, but most of that is just damage control. Please understand that I’m not claiming any of this is unimportant or not worth your time. The problem is our nurturing instinct wants us to do more—to show up with a wrench and torque the exact bolt that will fix someone. There’s no magic wrench you can wield that will cure depression for someone you care about. There are plenty of tools in the coping-with-depression toolbox, but bashing someone with their own tools won’t help them drive in a nail.

Alright, that all sounds pretty pessimistic. Didn’t I say something about making a tangible difference? I did, and I’ll repeat it. Take time to counter feelings of guilt, self-blame, low self-worth, etc. Most of us—depression or no depression—have a hyper-critical internal mirror. We don’t see the best version of ourselves; we may not even see a fair version of ourselves. With depression, it’s too easy to see through cat-poo-colored lenses. I’ll also assert that most of us don’t have an unbiased internal reference guide that says no, here’s the real, fair version of you. So what can we do? Be a mirror for the way you see someone. Show love, care, respect, admiration, or whatever it is the person inspires in you. Make it clear that being a part of their life is a joy and a blessing, not a burden or a curse. Say it with words and mean it. But also say it with your actions and with your body language.

I’m guessing the say it with words part is pretty clear, but I’d be happy to write more about that in another post—maybe I will! The say it with your actions and body language part is probably a lot harder to do. And it’s especially important with depression, because us clever depressed types are usually really good at empathy. If you’re sad because I’m sad, it’s probably making me even more sad. Did I say “sad” enough in that echo chamber? If that sounds like just a silly kitten-fart anecdote, here’s an article from the American Psychological Association: Empathy and depression: The moral system on overdrive.

So how do we mirror joy to someone who’s depressed without being condescending or patronizing? We do it earnestly and honestly. And importantly, we do it without sympathy. That may sound insensitive or cruel. Many of us respond to depression with sympathy because it seems like the kind, caring thing to do. But when we say something like “I’m so sorry you’re feeling sad” we’re confirming and enabling the negative, poo-colored lens stuff. From that little phrase, it’s too easy to hear “I’m so sorry. You really are a worthless failure and I can’t or won’t help you with that.” Congratulations, by trying to show someone you care you’ve made them feel worse.

Let’s talk about hugging for a moment. (I know, we’re in a pandemic. Who hugs these days?) I’d like you to visualize two scenarios where you might hug someone:

Hugging Scenario One:

You’re at a funeral reception. Someone you care about has lost a loved one. You go in for a hug, and with every ounce of your strength you give a hug that says I’m so saddened by all of this but I’m here with you.

Hugging Scenario Two:

You’re at home, and you hear a knock at your door. You open up to find a friend with your favorite ice cream in hand. It’s exactly what you wanted and you didn’t even ask for it! Within seconds, you throw your arms around your friend, thinking “I’m so glad this person is part of my life!” And even if you don’t say those words, it’s clear you mean it with the most robust, vibrant hug you’ve given all day.

Why am I talking about hugging scenarios? Because we spend too much time responding to depression with the sentiment of scenario one, and not enough time with the sentiment of the ice cream hug. Let’s say this is check-in concept number four:

Be clear about the intent of your check-in.

Be vulnerable.

Use language that prompts narrative, not judgement.

Mirror love. Mirror Joy.

I’d love to say that this will always work. It won’t. I’d like to say this will sometimes help. It might. Or you might find that it feels like nothing helps. Now we have to get to the last part of this post title. Don’t give up. If you’re not getting through, try other things, or have a conversation about how you can best be supportive. Alternatively, you might be helpful and/or appreciated and you’re just not getting affirmation/feedback. I’m being short on advice here because this topic deserves its own book. I may not write the book, but I will spend more time on this part in the future! In any case, keep trying for as long as you’re willing, or at least for as long as someone will let you in. Your presence, love, and joy are meaningful and important whether or not you see it.

So what’s next? At some point I’ll need to do some difficult contemplation on what we can possibly do when someone won’t let us in. For now, I’d like to spend more time on the stuff that doesn’t feel impossible. I’m not sure where that’ll bring me next, but I’m sure it’ll come to me like a kitten fart in the wind. In the meantime, please enjoy a presentation by Dr. Brené Brown on sympathy and empathy. I discovered this a few years ago, and it’s still important today in shaping my understanding of the power of empathy.

I've taken sertraline years ago for a shorter amount of time and remember going cold turkey (because I'm dumb lol). But had no withdrawal effects except one night I had a few brain zaps which was scary as hell. However I remember that the symptoms I got this time for first taking sertraline was much worse in comparison to when I did it years ago. So I was wondering if your symptoms at the beginning are bad, is that a clue that the withdrawal symptoms coming off them with also be bad? 

Also do you think my plan coming off them is a good idea (with taking the 25mg first)?"

weirdsomethingyey,depression,1620427289.0,Both living with depression and on antidepressants are bad compromises. Only thing that I can say for tonight.,"I cry once or twice a day, always. I think I got worse from taking lexapro some months ago,i feel I'll never have back my normality. I keep trying meds but there is nothing that works as I would like, are really SSRI working for someone? Yes they make me not able to be depressed but there is no life there at all, god.         I am struggling with percieving and feeling things, i think I became socially stupid(always been kinda of animal party), i feel I lost everything and, despite my efforts, i 'll never have anything back. How do we heal from this? Am I gonna live my life as a compromise forever? Sometimes I wish I had never been good at socializing or at loving, I wouldn' t miss it so much now. I can't feel the pleasure of a windy say, I can't want pizza because it doesn't give me anything, the only way in wich I can love now is brought by obsession, it is not loving, i percieve everything from the worst side.
I cannot see any recovery from this, only adjustment and habit. I do not see myself coming back even if I know there are many ways and most of people overcome this, what are all those way? I only see worse compromises.
I don' know the purpose of this post, I probably only want hope and succesful stories."

sadcatmommy3,depression,1620600042.0,Hopeless,"I think the title sums it up. I’ve had dysthymia for probable twenty years at this point (diagnosed ten years ago). I go through the motions of life, even received a graduate degree while still functionally depressed. But life isn’t very pleasant.

I’m not going to commit suicide but if I caught a terminal disease I’d likely shrug. Life just seems harder for me than the people around me. I have to psyche myself every morning to get out of bed, but I rarely miss work. I get on a good role for a few days or a week then my mood flatlines. And it’s back to square one.

My doctor put in a referral to see a psychiatrist more than a year ago. They offered me a few counselling sessions and then covid happened. I’ve been privately paying for a Counsellor for six months now. I have been seeing Counsellors on and off for fifteen years and haven’t made much improvement. But I get up and go to work most every day. I want to see a psychiatrist rather than another Counsellor, but I can’t make anyone take me seriously.

I have no hope that life will get better. I haven’t had enough energy to date in fifteen years. I don’t own a home of my one because I’ve had interruptions on my employment due to bad years and I’m a single mom to a nearly adult/live in an expensive place.

Basically I’ve reached my forties without hitting most life goals. And I have had a hedonic for decades which makes life itself a chore.

Thanks for listening to my whine."
enderfighter5000,depression,1620586891.0,Is it normal to feel more depressed and anxious during the late spring and summer?,"I have no clue why this happens, but whenever it's like late spring and summer and the evening comes, I just feel an overwhelming sensation of dread. I don't know why. It just makes me anxious and depressed to the point where I can't function anymore. Just really odd. Just heard the ice cream car drive by and for some reason that triggers it even more. It's weird becausw the summer tends to trigger it more than say cold, dark winter days.

She's throwing a party and I had to cut the front and back. When I offered to pony up the cash for someone to do all that herself she snapped on me. So when I asked her to rake a few of the leaves while I took a rest she made an attempt but grew frustrated and said she's moving the party to the front. She's disabled too but she keeps doing things that goes against that and keeps saying if she can work through it so can I.

Another thing she does is call my name every five minutes for things any modern adult should know like sending emails or logging in her FB. Apparently she can't memorize her gmail and password despite me writing them on paper and saving them on her phone.

She also  expects me to be her therapists because she has bad friends who constantly stab her in the back. As well as my dad who she's separated with but keeps hanging out with yet disrespect her all the time.

I'm 27 and I would move out but I'm on ssi and I have nowhere else to go. I pay my portion of the rent, I pay most of the cable bill, I buy my own food & clean after myself but she still wont leave me be!

Bit_Cop,depression,1620595766.0,Today was the closest I've come to ending it.,"Never thought I'd make a second post here, but oh well.

20[M], and earlier this day was the closest I've come to actually going through with killing myself. I'll be honest and say it was a weird feeling; as there wasn't anything that really brought in on.

Sure I saw that my friends were out together again without me which is always a bummer, but I've been seeing that for months, among other shitty things during this whole pandemic. Yet today of all days as I sat on my bed and scrolled through my phone, I just decided:

""Yeah, I suppose that's it."" Got the knife, got the note I've already wrote out put beside me and kinda just sat down ready to do it. Obviously since I'm typing this, I didn't go through with it - a mixture of not wanting my mom to come back home to a dead kid, and just generally me being a bitch, meant in the end I just put everything away.

But knowing how close I was, it's a strange feeling. Even now I just kinda feel . . . Empty? I thought I'd be scared, fuck even anger would be justified, but this hollow feeling is what I'm drifting off to tonight.

So yeah, that's my story. Don't know the exact purpose of this post, to be honest I might delete it - but my therapist said typing things down could help."

mmkzero3,depression,1620582919.0,"A lot of shit happens to us, we should not be too hard to ourselves.","Today was a day of reminiscing aboutold times and how fucked up life is and how fucked up my own life in this world is. I do not want to get into detail because we all have our problems we have to face on a daily basis. I just came to 2 conclusions today, which do not make sense when comparing them, but it shows how versatile depression can be and why non-depressed people never get a grasp of what depression really is:


1. You can hate yourself up to the point where this self hatred actually makes you happy. Just think about it. If you confront yourself in the worst possible way it can either lead to this hate being converted to happiness or it gets deeper into your flesh. Telling yourself that you are shit is different from just thinking about it.


2. Life is made out of sub-categories every human wants to fulfill, and we do not care how we will achieve them. Also, a drug itself is not harmful as long as it does not replace anything in your life. A criminal will point his gun to your head, because this is the moment where he actually gets the most attention from a person. It is the feeling we crave, not the actual tool we make use of to reach that goal.

I had many more thoughts built up for today , but I guess this is enough."

I asked if he was ok, he said he was. I know he was lying so I said « hmm.. are you sure? » and he literally told me « can you stop asking questions »...  

Last time he said that he had tears in his eyes and he started to try and make me laugh just so we could change topics.  

Idk what to say/do. I am exhausted... He broke up with me after 5 years together because of his diagnosis. He has been pretty depressed as well. I started going to the diabetic center to talk to my dad’s friend (who’s an endocrinologist) and he has been so helpful. I even started reading lots of books and well, pretty much educate myself since my dude has never wanted to fully share what was up. He says it’s to protect me because « he knows he could ruin my life one way or another ». We agreed to stay friends since we love each other way too much to just let go.

Lately we’ve been communicating a little bit. He initiated flirting and sexting and well.. it’s been a roller coaster with him and I’m fine. I mean when everything gets shitty you gotta support those you love, right ? But today idk, his « can you stop asking questions » made me feel rejected and pushed away to the point where I don’t know if I’m allowed to be in his life anymore. You might think I am being dramatic but I am simply tired of not being able to see him (thanks covid) and just being pushed away as if I was a stranger..

Frequent-Size994,depression,1620538017.0,Taking a Chance is Bringing Light Back Into my Life,"I was born into trauma. For the first six years of my life I had a difficult to diagnose medical condition that caused pain to radiate through my entire body, movements, body position or even loud noise would amplify this greatly.

I was molested when I was a child on numerous occasions by more than one person.

I was the target of bullies in school.

My mother was psychologically abusive to me as a child and still has her moments.

As an early teenager, the bullying mostly stopped as I grew to be larger than most. However, my happiness was quickly crushed when my mother told me that her and my father were getting divorced and that it was my fault. The psychological abuse became significantly worse without my father there to control any of her output. 

I was told the following things and many more during that time:

""You need to lie about who you are if you want any girl to like you, it'll be hard for you to keep it up.""

I moved in with my dad when I was around 18. Things improved drastically. When I would go to see my mother she would tell me that my mental health was declining rapidly and that she was strongly considering having me made a ward of the state. She would tell me that I should move back in with her, I certainly wasn't falling for that.

I did well in college and graduated with a degree in software development. Shortly after this I met a woman who was just like my mother but I couldn't see it. We got married in less than 6 months and she became horribly abusive after that. I couldn't force myself to leave. I was so busy working a job I had when I was in college plus another job that I had no time to pursue a job as a software dev. Once she managed to drain all of my money, she got in with the wrong crowd and began working as an escort. I had zero idea she was doing that. Fast forward, I finally get the courage to break things off with her and kick her out. I decide my best course of action to get over her was to find a woman to sleep with on Tinder. There I found  her profile, selling herself. Initially, I thought this was done to scorn me in some way and not the truth. I check other sites known for women doing that and found her posting. I contacted a friend that she had a falling out with and the friend directs me to far more media where she's advertising. 

This left me absolutely devastated. The weight of everything before that and then that rendered me unable to give a fuck about much of anything. Shortly there after I went through bankruptcy and divorce in the same month. That made things even worse. The period when I was just living with my mother was dark but I was able to overcome it. This has left me in a deep state of depression for quite a while. 

I've been trying for a few years to get over my past or at least build my skills and portfolio as a software dev to get a job I don't absolutely hate. The job I'm working at now makes me absolutely miserable. I've got some money saved up and have decided to quit that job at the end of this month. I can't take any more of it. The decision to do that has brought some happiness back to my life. I'm starting to feel a bit like myself during college. Enthusiasm and passion are starting to make small appearances. I hate to take the leap but, I feel that if I don't things are only going to keep getting worse. It's been getting easier to get out of bed since I've made the decision."
watchingTheStormGoBy,depression,1620590557.0,Mother's Day without my mom,"I lost my mom to cancer a few years ago.  She was incredibly close to me, my wife, and kids.  I still observe the holiday for the sake of my wife and kids but it's so damn hard to get into it, or plan for it, or make the day extra special for my wife.  We still got her a card, flowers, and a thoughtful gift.  We cooked her favorite brunch, and don't expect her to do anything she doesn't want to.   She said it was more than enough, but it's not nearly the celebration we used to have.  I feel really depressed today.  My mom was way too young to die (62). I kinda want to go to the cemetery but I hate cemeteries.   Also it's cold and rainy where I live.  I also don't like to cry.  I wish I could get on with my day and do the things I have to do, but I feel glued to my chair.  For anyone else suffering this mother's day because your mom is gone, or far away, or an asshole, please know I feel for you.  This is a rough day."

luckyinlondon,depression,1620423086.0,I really don’t like me.,"I’ve known this for quite some time but I have to remind myself more often than not. I have no family, no friends, no one to love because heck why lower your standards to be with me? I’ve been bullied most of my life by my family, ‘friends’. I’ve always been the punchline of everyone’s joke at the dinner table and at the school canteen. I was molested by my cousin, punched by my male neighbour, had a heavy dictionary thrown at me. Been choked by my sister, sat on by my other sister. I’ve been spat on by my mum twice, threatened by my older brothers. Been told many times that I don’t matter, that I’m not normal; no one has ever defended me. And I really believe them, I really don’t like me. I hate me. I ask God why did you make me? What a waste of a human life, I will gladly give my soul to a miscarried baby or someone’s sweet grandma who passed away. If I could, I’ll let them live instead of me. I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to exist, I want to fade away. 11th of February 1998 should mean nothing to everybody. I’m really sorry that you had to read this, as I’m crying but my whole life, I’ve either been neglected or abused. No one in my family seems to think so, that’s okay why should they even care about a non-person like myself.

I didn’t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore.

They’ve been my only support system through years of hardship and depression. But lately, that’s been less of a good thing; I don’t think I have any other reason to be alive anymore. Most days, I spend a lot of energy wondering if they hate me, if I’m a burden to them, etc. We used to hang out every day or go on Discord every night, but life has made us all too busy for that. I’m unable to distract myself from the void that’s been left behind.

Without going too into detail, I’ve gone through a lot of things I struggle to move on from. Things like old best friends committing suicide, being falsely accused of rape, being raped myself. I grew to live by the philosophy of “there’s no such thing as a bad reason to live”. I hung onto the words of those four: sometimes, the wisdom they gave, and sometimes just the warmth of their company. I wouldn’t say their words were ever useless, because they did make me a stronger person. But when life gets unbearable, I depend on them a lot.

I can’t focus on anything but these thoughts right now. I should be happy for my friends living fulfilling lives, but my loneliness is too distracting. I want to be better for all of our sake, but the days are long. I have no idea how to live for myself; even when I do something simple like read a book, my brain is filled with thoughts of “you’re only doing this because nobody wants you”. I feel like I’m pushing them away, which is driving me crazy, even though I should be at peace even if they all hated me.

I'm depressed because if I take an extra semester again, it means paying for another semester. If I want to get a degree, I would have to pay all of the college tuition before I can get my degree. But because of Covid and my dad's diabetes getting severe, the financial situation of my family is not good. If I dropped out of college, it will waste all the money that goes to my college's tuition. 

I was lazy and now I have to face the consequences of my actions. If took an extra semester, my dad would have to pay for another semester eventhough our financial situation isn't good.

Once again I caught myself looking at the local list of psychologists.  It reminded me of a conversation I had with a guy I game with where he said, ""I noticed that I didn't feel like my normal self.""  That got me to thinking what my ""normal self"" actually is.  It's been so many years now; I just don't know.  I don't remember what it felt like to just be happy for a whole week or even just a whole day.  I realized all I have are blips of happiness, maybe longer lasting contentment, then the morose nothingness of indifference.  

It's hard to consider therapy at this point I feel.  I imagine I'd just be wasting time a doctor could spend helping someone actually seeking to get better.  It would be neat to be a clinical study maybe.  I feel I might make an interesting patient to the inquisitive mind.  Narcissistic, I know...  Still.  We all want to think of ourselves as unique and special.    


I am just so tired of suffering.  It's been so long since I didn't hurt.  I enjoy nothing anymore.  Everything is just routine; no passion.  I see myself watching years go by wondering what the point of it is anymore.

boldbenji,depression,1620507881.0,1.5 years of therapy and nothing has changed.,"I (f28) have been in therapy for almost one and a half year now. My therapist is going to move away in July so I only have a few sessions left (I see him once a week). I had problems opening up to him the whole time even though I like him and we get along well, I'm just not good at expressing my feelings and talking about myself. Last week he told me that he has the feeling that ever since he told me he's leaving in summer I'm getting more distant and that's probably true because what's the point of still going there anyway? I don't feel better at all since starting therapy. Nothing has changed. I still don't enjoy living my life and I feel like I don't make progress at all. I still think about suicide a lot and in the beginning I hoped that at least that would change. If therapy does not work for me then what will? 

I'm suffering from depression for over 10 years now. I did therapy, I was in mental institutions multiple times. Still fighting this battle after all this time makes no sense at all if I'm not going to feel better anyways. Maybe someone feels similar about therapy or want to share their experience about getting better after years of therapy? 

This all sounds more hopeless than I intended it to be. What keeps me going is taking care of my chocolate lab. He's my best friend and I have no idea what I would do without him.

However, although she’s still cordial when I reach out, she never makes the first move anymore, and I feel like she’s ignoring me on social media where we used to exchange likes and support for the other’s work often.  I worry that if I ask her if we’re cool, then she’ll think I’m some kind of emotionally unstable co-dependant whose confidence in a relationship needs to be reaffirmed constantly (I guess that’s true tho).

chewybacbacca,depression,1620630108.0,Tired of people saying that gen z is fake depressed and that we’ve made it trendy.,"All one has to do is look at the rising suicide rates over the years(I know it’s been on the rise for years in the US) and the fact that social media has caused our generation to be more lonely, detached, and anxious than ever before. 

I guess what made me write this is that I’ve read countless “unpopular opinions” about how Billie Eilish is overrated because she writes depressing music to be trendy and that she’s only “fake depressed”. Little do they know, she’s talked about how she used to self harm in bathrooms and has had suicidal thoughts. 

I do think it’s become fairly popular nowadays to “gate-keep” depression. Now you have to prove you’re actually depressed in order for people to initiate you into this depression club they’ve formed. If you smile a few times with your friends or take social pics for Instagram, those gatekeepers think it’s impossible for you to be depressed. You make one dark-humored joke about having depression, they’ll say you’re only doing it because it’s trendy; not because you’re actually depressed. 

Gate-keeping depression is weird. ANYONE can be depressed and even suicidal. Rich or poor. Conventionally attractive or not. In a committed relationship or not. That person you see who’s bubbly in person could be putting up a facade so you can’t see just how broken, damaged, and helpless they feel internally.

Gate-keeping depression does way more harm than good(if there’s any good at all) because what if that person who’s in serious need of help decides to attempt suicide—not to actually die but solely to be taken serious and to avoid people saying they’re seeking attention."

my dad came into my room a few days ago, asking if we can talk.. he said i might get some of this mental ilness from him, because he also feels far away from reality, and his mother was also a bit ‘cookoo’ (they lived in communism so getting professional help wasn’t an option). From what i understood, he is depressed. he also told me he’s had some suicidal thoughts and ideas, but that too many people rely on him, or something along those lines, basically that he would do it if so many people wouldn’t suffer if he did it. then he said he hopes i won’t hurt myself, because he wouldn’t be able to live with it. he also told me he might want to go see my psychiatrist, so maybe ‘she can give him something to make him feel better’. this whole conversation absolutely blew my mind because he’s such an introvert, he doesn’t talk much, especially when it comes to his emotions. We’ve had a pretty close relationship, and we get along really well, although the lack of communication can be felt. 

what the hell do i do now? he’s away with my mom for the weekend at the sea, so he said to not talk to my psychiatrist yet, because maybe he’ll feel better after the sea, but i doubt it, since he’s been like this for a long time. he doesn’t leave his desk (since he works from home, he has his own company). and he hasn’t been smiling much lately. i genuinely don’t know what to do.

i’m trying to be there for him, to support him, to see how his day went and offer comfort. but what if he’s thoughts don’t go away? what if i lose him? what then?

how can i help him? 

PS: my grandma told me (without his consent) that he’s attempted suicide once before, when he was in his 20s... we always took his silent personality as simple introversion, but i’m thinking it’s much much more.

Commercial_Speaker_4,depression,1620563508.0,How to overcome low self-esteem?,"Hi all,

I just wanted to ask has anyone ever overcome quite severely low self esteem? 

I have always tended towards low self esteem but it is ruining my life now. 

I am very lucky as I have a very supportive partner but it has been a struggle!

I am currently taking anti depressants and going through counselling and although my physical symptoms of depression have improved I still feel like human trash 4 months down the line.

I have tried taking up new hobbies, writing down positive things, I exercise every day but I cant help but feel like all that I (and multiple health professionals) are doing is trying to inject some kind of false importance in to my life ? 

I have had a fair share of trauma which I think unfortunately has ruined my life ? Eight years ago something very unplesant and traumatic happened to me, causing me to have a psychotic episode and subsequently develop PTSD. I had to move universities and completely rebuild my life which I still feel like I am recovering from in a way. 

I am currently off work with stress. A few months ago I was misdiagnosed at the medical centre I work at which has lead to long term health issues. I have tried to relocate workplaces but was told this would be impossible. Subsequently, I did not put in a complaint about my care as I felt if I had to deal with this too, I would no longer be able to function. Before this, I suspect I was burnt out which did not help- I was often coming in an hour early and leaving 2-3 hours late with no lunch during the pandemic. Understandably, morale was low which caused me to get in to heated conversations with colleagues when I would usually be able to keep my head (someone calling me a ""silly woman"" ""irish and therefore stupid"" etc) so I now feel ashamed of that as well and like it is impossible to go back!! 

I have tried looking at another job to do which would be less intense, but I dont feel confident to undergo an interview process etc. As I am a human dumspter fire.

Even when I meet with friends I feel I cant look them in the eye as I just feel so ashamed at what a disappointment I am. 

I have no peace or rest and I can't hide it from my partner any more. Even though in the past I have felt negatively, I would often try to speak positively and spin a positive narrative but it hasn't changed my thinking. I just hate myself so much and I don't know who I am trying to fool at this stage.

I know I am lucky and have more than most,  but I feel as though I am like some rescue dog who has to spend their life convalescing in a quiet place because their prior experience has ruined them. What has it all been for ?  Maybe I deserve to feel like pond sludge. 

Has anyone overcome something like this and felt they could just live their life/ do what they want rather than hide away?

So - cutting to the point here - ***how do I fix that?***

Some personal information and factors:

* I don't currently see a mental health specialist of any kind (trying to atm, but I've never been able to open up to them before)
* Even if I get to the point of doing something, I am so easily distracted by other things I can/need to do, even if it's far less important
* Adding onto that - when I am actually doing it, I can't focus on it completely. It's not even the distractions, it's like my brain can't process anything and I'm left with a bunch of words that I have to read over and over again before they even begin to make sense.
* In high school, so I have to study. I'm also trying to write stories (creative writing, which I'm genuinely good at), along with learning another language (or two...). I haven't even started the assessment task that was due over a week ago. I had a month to do it.
* It's gotten so bad (the motivation) that I don't practise any basic hygiene. I shower about once a week and brush my teeth only before I go to school. That's it.
* Also, I skip a lot of school, (80% attendance rate, not that bad, but not good either, scared it'll get worse)

&#x200B;

So the main things I want to focus on doing everyday are:

* Studying and doing homework
* Learning another language
* The creative writing
* Basic hygiene
* General willpower to do things because I want to or I need to (doesn't matter how much I want to do something, usually the choice of not moving surpasses it)

&#x200B;

*If any of you have any personal stories, tips, solutions, guidance, whatever! Please, please, please help a fellow depression-ridiculed person out! <3*"
DaddyDankMemes420,depression,1620626912.0,Why is it that life has a way of kicking you when you're already down?,"24 years old here and within the past 3 months, my depression has gotten to its darkest point in my life. These days, I feel a lot of self hate, numbness and jaded towards life in general and ""the way things are"". 

These feelings are hard to cope with, I find myself not wanting to go to work and just wanting to sleep. If I'm having a good day, I can convince myself to do something I enjoy. But that's about all I'm doing for that day. Once I'm finished, I'm done with everything else for the day.

Anyway, all of these feelings are enough to deal with on their own, but when things seem to be at their worst, life always comes in to kick me while I'm already down.
Just this past week, I overdrafted in the bank, 2 tires went bad on my car. One has a leak and the other a broken belt. I'm nearly out of gas and still have to get to work, I owe money to a cash advance place, I only got 14 hours scheduled at work this past week so I'll have like no money to money to pay for all this out of my next check. As if this all wasn't enough, my fiance texts me today that our microwave broke. All of this came at the worst possible time. We're trying to save for a wedding. My fiance has bad anxiety when it comes to money and I just feel like a failure and a burden.

I can't even pay to keep my car running or the household finances in check, let alone pay for a wedding or support a family. All of this with my depression just solidifies my insecurities of being a failure at life. For a good half hour today, I felt like I was really going to kill myself over a microwave.

I don't know, life just feels like too much anymore. My depression has gotten too severe for me to deal with and the universe just doesn't seem to have me in its favor. I don't know what to do for myself or what's going to make me feel like I used to."
a24chadduog-,depression,1620552435.0,End Of The Road,"
I'm 39 and I've always dealt with massive depression. My coping mechanism was always exercise and I'm to broke to own a car so I'd bike commute everywhere. Unfortunately five years ago I was in a bike accident the result of which made sex impossible. At the time I was in love and in a new relationship but that was cut short. I dealt with the deep depression and suicidal ideation from that and just barley resigned myself to a life alone without relationships.the loneliness was sometimes unbearable but I kept myself busy with other things tried to find other focuses in life. I unfortunately have no college degree and a just slightly above minimum wage job so my career is non-existent. 

A month ago I injured myself lifting an I now have a hiatal hernia that's reduced my already low quality of life to zero. The hiatal hernia pushes the stomach through the esophagus and I'm basically spewing acid all day long. It's bad enough that they want to perform surgery but the operation is a nightmare and everywhere I look the outcomes are not great. Life limiting in either direction. High probability of permanent constipation. I have to sleep propped up on a special pillow or else I'm in severe pain all night. Food was one of few joys for me and now I can't eat anything but the most bland foods at very specific times. Even the prescription antacids I'm on don't help. I've decided this is no way to live. Even if by some miracle the surgery isn't botched, I'm severely limited to what I can do in life. I suppose I'm a coward in some way, but I can't bear it any longer. If anything this has just forced something I've thought of many times before. In the past, suicidal ideation could be somewhat of a comfort during hard times, but it feels very different now that it's real for me. Now that I can't even lay down on my back without excruciating pain and internal damage.

I've spent long hours researching the best least painful options for me, most feel very gruesome. Obviously. I thought about hanging myself several times but I don't think I could do it without messing up. Instead I've decided I'm going to take a bunch of mushrooms, go down to the ocean early in the morning while it's still cold, wade out with a life jacket so I can drift off and let hypothermia take me without the panic of drowning. If it was still winter I'd go up into the mountains and do the same. I have nothing and no one and rather this than squeaking out an even more painful physical existence for next decade or so."

TheKATinthehat_,depression,1620428545.0,An overdose of uncomfortable,"
I feel bound by an inevitable state of uncomfortability. The feeling of an unknown that is eating me up and I can’t stand it. 
This feeling is a lot like being forced to sit in the dark when you are deathly afraid of both- it and all that is imagined to lurk among it. 
Or like being forced to co-exist with the spider you saw in your room because you’ve lost sight of it even though you are physically and mentally itching to leave every second you are stuck there. 
For me, that is the feeling of being awake. I am constantly itching, every second, to escape my body. My reality. I can’t sleep.  I can’t eat. I can’t breathe. I can’t sit still.  No good movie, walk, talk, or song is able to keep me from feeling that need to escape me. I am constantly restless with nothing to distract me because the distractions are merely just that. Distractions. Something to keep me occupied for a few seconds or minutes while the uncomfortability peeps over my shoulder, never leaving. As If we are attached at the hip. So what do I do when  I can’t sit still, but I can’t do enough to keep me busy?  I can’t be awake but my body won’t let me sleep and nothing I do to keep busy is able to distract me for long enough to feel something other than uncomfortable."

But at the same time, I know other people get tired of me constantly writing them. I know they get tired of always hearing me complain. They’re not my therapists and I have to realize that. I’ll just deal with it alone the best way I can. I’ve shutdown completely. I’m not answering anyone because I’m obviously not worth anyone’s time. Just leave me alone please."
spicydevilchicken,depression,1620581012.0,I don’t like where I am in life and my mum admitted she's unhappy and lonely.,"Throughout my childhood I thought by the time I'm 27, I would have moved out of home, have a boyfriend, have a job and have some sort of life. Then when my depression got worse I didn't see myself living past 30 years old. 
I am not happy where I am in life, I am 27 and I still live at home, I can't get a job even when I've applied to so many places. I am overweight and can't seem to lose it and I have a boyfriend who I amazing but I can't stop putting doubts in my mind. 

I just don't really want to live like this anymore or live at all. I don't want to die because I am leaving behind too many responsibilities like my dog and my birds. 

I am sick of being sick!!! Why can't I just have a normal brain instead of one that doesn't want to live? 

I haven't talked to my dad in 3 weeks and today on mothers day, my mum cried and said she's lonely. My dad is being a dick to her and she can't talk to my brother or sister and she talks to me. But she said that I sometimes don't want to listen and then she has no one to talk to. I told her it's not fair that she's putting it all on me. She needs to talk to my dad about his behaviour or talk to a therapist. She doesn't want to listen to that. She said she's lonely and unhappy.
I don't know what to do about this. I already feel guilty that I will leave her if I do ever move out. 

But I can't stay here, my dad made my depression worse when we had our fight to the point of me cutting myself. 
I haven't self harmed in years too. I just couldn't stop my thoughts and I wanted to hurt myself.

Gosh, I can't gather my thoughts and I fricken hate life."
throwawaysb3,depression,1620539050.0,Alive against my will.,Im ready to be dead. I'm not a medical professionals so i can't trust my self to end it. Basically No one actually cares so the basic human right to die has been banned everywhere. No one cares everyone just wants to tell me how I'm wrong how life's worth living. No it's  not.  Its not for me. I'm on meds I'm seeing a therapist. I know what I want and i want to die. This isn't just some passing feeling i have had 0 will to live for years now. Hopefully somewhere will finally care and life the ban so i can finally end my suffering.
InformalCommittee323,depression,1620532456.0,Am I Actually Though?,"Sometimes when I'm going through a depressive episode, I start to wonder if I really am depressed, or if I'm just pouting. Like I know that every diagnostic test I take has me as moderate to severe on depressed, but I still think of it just as a personality flaw. So, it leaves me frustrated with myself. Does anyone else feel this way?"
PrinceHal9000,depression,1620486935.0,Primer,"My best attempt to describe it is: An anhedonic state brought about by a feeling that all potential actions are hopeless and futile. Maybe that sounds like *hopelessness*, but *hopelessness* evokes an image of a haunted person shaking with despair. That is not me. I am still. 

I am a human body lying on a mass-produced, cheap imitation of a midcentury couch. I am a human body staring at the tenth generation of a smartphone. I am a human body updating the New York Times newsfeed for the 57th time in a day. I am a human body refreshing a YouTube feed even though all the interesting videos have already been watched. I am a human body checking Instagram even though nothing of interest is happening.  I am a human body feeling that time is slipping away, unable to summon the will to do something productive. 

The cycle repeats: NYTimes, YouTube, Instagram.

Mindlessly, nothing changes. 

When I first bought that couch, I absolutely loved it.

Is my experience specific to this period of human existence (early 2020s America emerging from what we are calling “the pandemic”), or is it something more fundamentally human, experienced by others in every period? Is it brought on by having too much time to think, not enough distraction by work? Is it a response to a world that I am experiencing through the wildly distorted lenses of the various media I frequent, media that seems insidiously designed to make me feel disturbed enough to click on the headline/advertisement? Is it masking the frustration I feel at my incompetence to attack the greatest challenges of my life which are always lurking, ready to spring to conscious thought at any moment? 

I check the NYTimes again.

I am distracted. The red robin in the green spring through my window is also growing weary of the chainsaw gut renovation taking place at the neighbor’s house. 

I have a lovely home. I built a business. I am more successful than I could have ever imagined. The NYTimes hates me. I am a member of the category to blame for everything.

How do I get off this couch? What quantum fluctuation within the endlessly-exstensible systems of my brain will result in a state-change to run the DoThis(string action) method? It will come. It always does. No one stays on the couch forever.

I bought a book: The Oxford Handbook of Human Motivation. I have not read it.

I put down the phone. I meditate.

A light.

A wave.

A voice.

A realization.

I am no one. Who I was is gone. I threw him into the volcano years ago when I started building the business. It was the only way to survive the 120 hour work weeks. It was the only way to survive the endless, brutal negotiations. It was the only way to separate myself from the misplaced dreams of my youth. It was the only way to handle the grief of a failed marriage that was entirely my fault. Be the character: The Leader. Sacrifice the self for the good of the whole. Steer the ship through turbulent waters while the disease (or whatever) eats you from the inside out. Have a drink. Never let go of the wheel.

I stare at my phone. The NYTimes tells me I haven’t paid my fair share.

It’s long past time to buy a new phone.

So what now?

The Leader has served me well. He did his job. He will continue to do so. I can’t kill him. I need him. The mortgage must be paid. Hundreds of people depend on him to keep things rolling along so they can buy their houses, get married, have kids, and keep the whole cycle going. The Leader can’t go anywhere.

But (wait one minute). 

What if there is a way?

Transparency through anonymity.

Truth through obfuscation of the self.

Escape the Human Zoo.

Continue the cycle of reality by creating its propagator.

Jesus Christ, it’s going to be a lot of work.

I have a mission. I have hope. I know what I must build. I know how to do it.

I can see each of the steps perfectly laid out before me. They have always been there. I thought I saw them in the past, but I could only make it a few steps before I stepped out into space and missed completely, expecting to feel that awful feeling of transitioning to an unanticipated freefalling state, but instead feeling nothing at all and simply landing flat on a cheap imitation of a midcentury couch.

I should buy a new couch.

But not now.

Take the first step.

Get off the couch.

Look behind you.

There is a circuitous road that is well-worn from the steps I have taken, leading to this point of my approaching-middle-age life at the dawn of post-pandemic America."

Lost a long term relationship tryna put myself out there again but things just ain’t the same. Feel useless, unhappy, and worthless. Friends seem to come and go. Family has their own issues. What to do at this point? I keep reading books I think will somehow give me an epiphany but let’s me real that whole crap about “only you can help yourself” is too true and I’ve clearly given up. I don’t know anymore. My therapist says I’ve been neglected my whole life and that’s true. And now the only person who made me feel cared for left. It hurts so much for that reason. That they knew I struggled with this and they still decided they were too good for me and I deserve to be left to rot on my own. They chose to give me pain. How can someone just do that? I don’t know anymore. I don’t know where this is going. I want to say I want to continue for my family but I’d be lying. I have no one to talk to no one to listen.

Bai_Ruoyan,depression,1620466920.0,Bottling up,"I think I've been bottling up my feelings for too long. Everything started back in March. At that time, I was excited to finish my college assignment which requires cooperation of some people (which requires their pictures) but I was let down by them and before I knew it, the deadline passed. When my friends asked me about my work, I dodged them because of course I never managed to finish it. Then everything went downhill starting from there. Maybe because that day affected me very much but every assignments I did started becoming harder and harder to finish and before I knew it, there's four of my courses that I didn't manage to hand in. There was group assignments too and at first, I was working happily with them; conversing in discord and all but slowly, I feel repressed. Before I knew it, I started isolating my friends altogether. Over the course of these two weeks, I've only texted one friend who doesn't have any relation with my college. Even so, I never tell her anything about this. My family started to worry but its ironic because they're one of the bad stressor that happened; and it's also ironic because I would rather be at home than at college. Not long ago, my cat died but I feel nothing. I feel like an empty husk. I lost all motivation to draw let alone writing some stories. I also feel like my health started dwindling because the last time I got exposed to the sun, I feel like fainting but managed to hold on. My mind started feeling negative and I started waking up late on daily basis. My escape currently was probably watching vtubers from nijisanji along with listening to some songs from utaites but even then, maybe because I haven't talked for too long, I decided to vent here. Thank you for reading this. I've been feeling even more useless lately so I'm typing this since there's no one I can talk to about this. I've been reading that confiding with someone you barely know can be helpful so I sought for that solace."
YourLostChapstick,depression,1620465522.0,"Just been spilling my mind, could use some help","Desperately in need of help and guidance

Posting this in a couple subreddits but I really would love to here all of your advice. Yes 
This is very long but it’ll help understand where I am currently at with everything. Please help me.

I guess I can start off by saying I am a 21M senior in college about to get kicked out of my program for going below gpa requirement.

If I’m being honest I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore. I stop every now and then and think to myself how have I even made it here. If I’m being honest I feel like I’ve just been cruising by trying to enjoy life way too much because being younger I realized that I have a lot of freedom right now with little responsibility. Which typing out is such a terrible mindset. 

To make a short story long I am diagnosed ADHD, General Anxiety and clinical depression. I’ve been taking medication (20mg adderall IR 3x a day for ADHD and 40mg Prozac once) for a while now but honestly I’m not even sure if it really helps. I saw a therapist for a bit and was told they wanted to try psychotherapy for my disassociating then came out of contact with me. 
I had a lot of issues growing up which all play some part maybe in why I am the way I am. Sometimes I feel like I’m lying to myself about how depressed or anxious I am. I guess mostly because I’m not the typical lay in bed all day everyday depressed or socially anxiety ridden diagnoses that will have a panic attack that will happen anywhere and everywhere. Pretty much my whole life was the type that you would look at me and say that I have literally no reason to think this way or feel this way and act that way. I’ve always been I guess what you could call a social butterfly. Sometimes I tell myself that I am the most extroverted invert you could ever meet. And no I’m not here to toot my own horn or anything but I’ve never had a probably with my social life. I’ve always been an athletic kid, outgoing and funny in the friend groups and, finding out a little more recently due to just basic observation and hearing it consistently, considered very attractive so it’s mostly easygoing with girls for me. All these are reasons on why I question why me? Why am I still a overthinking, inattentive sad boy that can’t handle life? I’ve felt like this for so long that I almost couldn’t imagine life without being so tired of living it. I’ve always hated blaming anything on my mental health issues, and all my childhood trauma because it just seems like an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated and nobody wants to hear that. But I guess that’s what happens when you are raised how I was always being told these things. 

So what I’m trying to say is college has really made me realize I wasn’t ready to go right into it out of highschool. Honestly I never really believed school was for me. The only plans that I ever really had past school was to become a professional athlete and if that didn’t work they wanted me to go to the military because my grades always pretty much lacked in school. I can tell you almost the exact point on when I started giving up and it was around age 12. I was already becoming so exhausted with everything. Life has always been so forced on me and what I wanted to do, I never really got a chance to really sit and think or talk to someone about what I really wanted to do because people always knew what was best for me. It got to the point where whenever people ask what I wanna do I never even know so I always come up with some lie to sound good or like I have some goals or aspirations and I’m going to seem like this great kid who’s got everything figured out.  Yea right...

I’m tired of being afraid and shackled down. I just want to atleast get my degree so after that I can finally have some real freedom. But since I’m about to get kicked out I have no idea what to do. I don’t even know if I liked my major. I’ve changed it twice and it’s because I know they both had potential to make a lot of money. The other problem is I really hate being home. Any chance I get I try to stay away from being back home. I don’t wanna get stuck because then I know I’ll become everything I’ve always tried to avoid and been afraid of becoming. I just don’t know what to do though. I could really just use some help in figuring out what my options are and my potential paths to take. I don’t hate learning. I just hate school."
Nerdcatwizard,depression,1620424990.0,Falling back into depression,"I just had one of my longest and hardest bouts of depression, it was like having a mental breakdown for 4 days straight, and I was almost certain I was going to kill myself, (just to be clear I’m not considering it anymore) and it was really hard.

It was terrifying, I couldn’t go back to how I was, numb, unhappy, scared, nothing bringing me joy, and just being confused. Once I realized that I was starting to slip back into depression, I got my worst panic attack to date, just last night, and I was super scared and just sad. It hurt again, and I just can’t go back to that, I haven’t told my parents or what few friends I have any of this, but the happiness is gone and I just feel numb again. I don’t know what to do and I’m just so scared, I can’t even cry, like I haven’t cried in over a year, Martin Luther King’s 2020 to be exact.

Don´t care if someone no responses. 

Well, to sum up I have rheumatoid arthritis (oh, and I studied music (guitar), so you can imagine). I also have a lot of keloids in my chest, some kind of weird stains on arms, chronic prostatitis with some kind of burning feeling inside my penis that I feel almost the whole day, I don´t have nipples (kind of weird), I have pimple marks on the face and neck (acne), cavities, huge stretch marks on my buttocks, varicocele, a very low grade of Peroyne desease in the right side of my penis, crooked jaw, crooked teeth, some awful furrows in my forehead, black spots on my nose. 

Obviously I don´t have the symptoms at the same time for example, prostatitis with varicocele and arthritis, but there they are. Btw I am not even a good looking man and I have never had sex with a woman because all the insecurities that generate me some of these conditions. Now I am in psichological therapy, taking antidepressants and some other medicines for my arthritis, varicocele, etc, but this continues depressed me.

Ive literally tried to ""treat women like people"" which ive always done and they use me for money, and TOLD IM THE BAD GUY FOR IT? there was this one girl i had a huge crush on, and she was the first girl I ever asked out in my life, she rejected me and was real nice about it, and even added me on social media cause ""i seem like a good guy"" but not long after, she started asking me for money, not a lot or anything, but it started with 15 bucks here and there, then 20 bucks here and there, and it was her birthday and she asked for more money, and i have no idea why this happens but she eventually just blocked me, I didnt do anything, respected that she said no, but when she asked for money, I just liked her a lot, and idk, I didnt expect anything in return except friendship at LEAST? but no, men are there for money ig.

Ive made friends with girls i used to go to high school with, omg the quickness in which they ask for money is insane, Ill ask to hang out, and i swear they set up a day to hang out, not even a date, just as friends, and on the day of, they go to hang out with some boy, AND ASK ME TO SEND MONEY! wtf.

One girl i ended up liking, and i told her i liked her, and she said, we can only be friends, and i shit you not, the next week, she asks me to pay her fucking rent for her, or else we arent talking anymore.

Im not seen as a human being who wants connection, im seen as a walking ATM, I refused as well. But still i get told its somehow my fault that women try to use me over, and over.

I get told constantly that im simply not allowed to date for some fucking reason, then i see this sub has 2.7 million people talking about dating, and i just scratch my head, and wonder why women hate me so much.

They think just cause i havent had sex, that im some subhuman and deserve to be alone.

idek what to do, seeing everyone have families, and hook ups is making me so mad.

I want to have a dead bedroom, I want to have a wife and just never have sex, the thought of sex just disgusts me tbh, makes me angry.

ive been thinking of suicide a lot lately im so fucking lonely.

I had a bad dream wich resulted in an anxious depressive reaction and i've started taking St John wort tea since 1 may.

I started for the first 3 days with 1 coup in morning and after i started to take 1 more in the evening wich helped me sleep better but i have some side effects that make me worry.

Since i drink the tea i am much more anxious, worried / agitated , mental fog / confusion, headache sometimes, dry mouth etc, i have pretty much all the sides effects.

I plan to take this tea for 3 months as the doctor recommended but with all these sides effects i feel worried, are they disappearing in time and start to feel better or they will remain all the time when i drink this tea ? 

Is there any chance to make the things worst for me ? Can you guys tell me your experiences with this herbal ?

I am at the day 8 since i drink this tea but i feel weird, does this go away with time ? Is this normal as an ""activation"" symptoms so my body can adjust to it or should i stop taking it ? 

Any opinion is welcome, thank you so much !"

I never thought my life would come to this as I was always the person to always say follow ur dreams... never give up ETC. But in the end it’s all a lie. I have no friends what’s so ever I never really have had any friends. I don’t even feel close to anyone in my family anymore. I’m sick and tired of feeling like this. I’m pretty sure everyone thinks I’m now just a looser. I can’t even think what people would miss about me if I was gone after a couple of weeks. Even if I was to get a girlfriend (don’t even know how I would) they would leave me and I’d feel bad for a girl being with me as I have just given up now and don’t see the point in carrying on 

I used to pray every single day that god would show me a sign on some guidance as I don’t know what I can even do anymore but no luck. Maybe the lord ignores me or Dosent exist

Horse_Around,depression,1620477112.0,that's it,"that's it -- after a short \~ 1-2 month remission i am back at the bottom. during this period i saw and FELT that life can be not only less bland and awful but also actually enjoyable. i experienced how does it feel to have dreams, goals and even plans to achieve them. i tasted the pleasure of having the energy to have a daily routine, to stick to a schedule, to be organised, to have passion in life and to find joy in it. i also was horrified as i was stroke by realisation that i spent my entire conscious life as far as i remember myself in this unbearable state of numbness and having only one desire -- to disappear. it was truly scary -- to realise how hopeless and bland your whole life was when you've felt how actually good life can be. i honestly don't know what happened which caused me to feel so good but i could never recreate this feeling again. now some time has already passed since i had any desire to achieve any long term goal and had any hope for better future and my mental state was becoming only worse and worse each day. now i can't sleep without crying again, i am constantly exhausted, i started cutting again. each single thing which i practiced everyday during this short period of remission has gone and the only thing i do regularly is wasting my time on useless youtube videos. some time prior to this period of remission i used to have the desire to accomplish certain things but didn't had any energy. now everything lost any point, i not only have no energy to do anything, i also have no any motivation. i absolutely don't want anything except to disappear. know even though some things are turning out for me literally better than any time before i'm still sinking deeper and deeper back into the hole in which i spent all my previous life. i actually had a luck to get to chat to some of my uni classmates on topics other than exchanging necessary info about studying. yes, it was just some whatsapp messages but damn -- i've actually talked to someone in a way that friends usually do for the first time in 3 years. they texted me myself bc of some of my jokes in general group chat and it is probably the only way i could receive some social interaction because i don't go out anywhere and i am too anxious and awkward cowardish useless piece of shit to have balls to start a conversation with someone even through social media or a messenger. it seems almost like a miracle but the only thing that it makes me feel is being paranoid that it's some kind of conspiracy that someone like my parent asked them to talk to me because i am unable to talk to someone myself. even talking to someone in a friendly manner for the first time in 3 fucking years left me absolutely bland with a bit of anxiety after some momentary surprise and positive emotions. i cant make myself get up from the bed and, most importantly, i cant see any point in it. i just want to disappear. or i dont want even that. i am just tired, so so so tired. i feel it, i feel that there is no hope in the future.

ibstudent1072,depression,1620513317.0,"I'm Not An Antinatalist, But...","I'm not an antinatalist, but I feel like many parents have the wrong reasons for having children.   


Today I was deeply hurt when my parents told me why they had me. They responded with, ""Why not?"" and, ""Imagine how boring it would be without you"". They also told me that they really wanted grandchildren from as well because it would be *nice* and it would pass on the family line*.* That word ""*nice*"" really struck me. Is this really why they had a child? Because it would be *nice?*  


I don't consider myself an antinatalist because of my Christian values, but I was so pained to find out that my parents didn't really have a valid reason for having a child other than that it would be *nice*. This is the kind of reasoning that you would use before buying a pet, not before having a child. All of this pain and suffering I am experiencing just because my parents thought it would be *nice* to have me. I really don't want to hate them, but a part of me truly does. A child should never be created out of selfish reasons, but out of a will to improve the world for the better. If I ever had a child (if I even lasted that long in the first place), I would have it in the hopes of making a positive impact to the world.  


I feel really guilty as well because my parents are really nice people and I've seen many reddit posts about abusive parents. I feel guilty for my emotions because my parents have never abused me and I am aware that there are many children out there who have it so much worse than me. I can't believe that I was so deeply hurt by this conversation with my parents today when there are literally children being physically and mentally abused everyday. My situation is such a first world problem, I'm a spoilt brat, I know. Yet I can't help but feel frustrated as to their reasoning for having a child. My mom has never abused me, but I can't remember the last time she said anything good about me. I know she loves me, but... sorry I can't put my thoughts into words. I just wish I had never been born in the first place..."

Jason5Lee,depression,1620466022.0,I hate my society and I don't want to live in it.,"When I was young I was educated that our society was wonderful. If you worked hard you would get what you want. (It's not America, it may be even worse). But when I start growing up I realize my society is far from perfect (pretty bad actually). Unfair evaluation, discrimination, exploiting workers, and many other things else.  
The problem is that it's a faith collapsed for me. Others just don't believe those words in the first place and think ""well, this society is bad, but what do you expect?"". But I believed them. I thought my society was fair and justice. After the reality showed me that these were lies, I started hating them. I started feeling depressed whenever I had an unfair situation in society. I don't want to live in it if it is just full of injustice that I have to tolerate.

I've thought about leaving it, but I don't know how. Suicide? I do not dare to do this plus it would make my parents really sad. Leaving and living somewhere far away? I wonder how can I support myself and my family at that place."

And still it's disgusting.

My mom keeps lecturing me about having piles of clothing and Easter bags and etc. and it makes me feel even worse. I feel like a hypocrite since I'm always fastidiously neat at my job and can't keep my own room clean. Everyone thinks I'm so great, but I'm not. I hate who I am as a person.

I just wish there was an easy way to be okay, not ""die now and hurt the people close to you"" or ""postpone suicide to stop the people close to you from suffering"". If I could die, and my family somehow wouldn't be hurt, I'd take it in a second. I don't want to be in pain anymore."
WraithofPickles,depression,1620525235.0,Reacting to depression diagnosis. What was yours like?,"It's been a trying year for me. I finally and gladly started seeing a therapist a few months ago and this week she told that she thinks it's highly likely that I have depression and recommended I start on a low dose of antidepressants. Since hearing this, I feel like all my depressive symptoms and thoughts have escalated dramatically over the last few days (I have not been/will not be taking anything until I consult with my family doctor this week). 

I honestly can't tell if all of a sudden I'm just beginning to notice ""my normal"" and how horrible I've been feeling, or if I'm having an overwhelming reaction to this news, or if I'm just in a real slum right now... I am just trying to gauge if anyone else has had a similar experience. 

I am grateful to hear this in a sense, and it seems to all add up. I just can't wait to take the steps to start feeling better, but I am consumed with the thought that I might not. 

After reading so many of these posts tonight, I am feeling really sad. Please take care of yourselves as best you can. You are not alone. <3"
lippidude,depression,1620623619.0,"Anxiety, depression, brainfog (i could use some help, i just feel like my head is less me and more something foreign)","I guess today has been a particularly rough day compared to others. I cant not obsess over brainfog and the lack of mental clarity that I have. its pretty bad and invasive when it comes to carrying out my day to day. I start to blur the lines of what is really happening and what feels familiar but instead is a false memory or something misremembered. i cant think of a specific example right now, but its like I'm gravitating towards maddening patterns of thought. everyday is a loop, like I'm a goldfish forgetting every trip around the bowl. Sometimes I'll see something and as a result, remember something and get completely floored that I couldnt remember that thing earlier and it took something unrelated to prompt a thought several days after the fact. 

my depression (which haunted me extremely) has sort of subsided. I think because life feels like this anxious half forgotten haze that the depression has no space to exist with how foggy and on edge I always am. but id rather be regular old depressed me and be able to think than feel like life is just occurring around me and I have no say. 

&#x200B;

on the anxiety front, i wake up at night very confused. sometimes a dream prompts the confusion and i feel like i need to do something, though i don't know what. sometimes i am just waking up with high anxiety and panic. either way the brain fog is taking me further and further away from recognizing the reality i have woken up in. like i get so lost in the extreme emotions of panic and anxiety that the fog makes it difficult to think my way into a rational frame of mind. 

it literally feels like mass in my head taking up space and reducing the room for me to think clearly. a year ago it wasnt so bad, i lived with a manageable amount of fog. now its disrupting the way i think, so much so, that ill want to believe these super imaginative scenarios where I'm really just in the simulation, and once I'm dead everything will be ok, ill wake up and think clearly again.  and that line of thinking starts to make me anxious like I am starting to become delusional. 

&#x200B;

idk what i am getting at by relaying this all to you. but i just need help. I started dieting last week to remove some irritable bowel syndrome irritants from my intake. i got my first covid shot so I can go back to the gym and see if that will have an impact. but I feel like I'm just spiraling out of control and that something much more devastating is lurking around the corner with how worn down and on the fringe of my own reality I am starting to feel. 

please suggest something (and not smoking a bowl, I'm 29 and have no more desires to get high or use drugs as an escape). i just want to experience life again and feel motivated to live."

Most of my hobbies I've dropped, maybe picked up later and have dropped again. Also I take up multiple hobbies like playing guitar, drawing, animating, writing, etc. cause my hobbies like I said before get boring. Relationship wise is as you'd expect, kind of crap. School wise I'd say is normal like most people until I get stressed then things drop. Medically along with being diagnosed with ADHD, ADD, OCD, Insomnia, Compulsive Sexual Disorder I'm also diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. My blood pressure and anxiety is another thing, my anxiety is off the charts especially at my age (24) cause I'd be more considered an inside person than an outside person who nearly breaks down just thinking about starting conversations with new people, especially girls and conversation wise I'm the worst unless I am friends with them. Nothing I think pill wise has worked for me and therapy to me is something I don't really want nor can pay for. How would you try to help yourselves if you were/are in this situation? My feelings of my depression have always been something I hate bringing up cause I feel mentally and emotionally I'm something I wouldn't want to lay out to someone, even my family, cause they probably don't have that time so people on here that pass by on here can choose whether or not they want to invest some brain in this.

I've decided to do it today though because I wanted to share my small victory that I experienced tonight.

I read a book. It was political, it was dry as fuck, I have no idea why out of all the fantastic fiction books i bought for a bit of escapism, the dry as fuck non-fiction political book was the one that kept my attention, but it is what it is. 

The reason this is such a victory is because I haven't been able to hold my focus for long enough to read a whole book in YEARS, and it's been especially hard to concentrate on anything since being on prozac. The past few months especially, everything has just been a blur, my head has been too foggy to do anything significant. But a tiny bit of clarity managed to stick around long enough for me to read a book. 

I love reading, and for the first time in years, I kept reading and reading until I reached the end of the book and I actually processed everything that I read. I honestly feel so elated right now."

deltorarox,depression,1620514017.0,"How to tell someone you want to kill yourself without saying you ""want to kill yourself""","I've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for more than 5 years. Lately, I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to the edge. I want help desperately. 
The problem is that every time I've tried to reach out to a therapist or teacher or professor for help (family isn't an option) and even vaguely expressed that I had suicidal ideation (not even that I was going to kill myself) they have immediately committed me to either PHP or, most recently, an actual psych ward. This, of course involves pulling me out of school and work. As someone with a severe adjustment disorder, this just exacerbates my suicidal thoughts and I've made that very clear, but my autonomy is stripped from me nonetheless. 
At the same time, I desperately need my therapist and professors to know how depressed and suicidal I am so that they can make the necessary accommodations.  I feel like the guarded way I've taught myself to speak makes it so that the people around me don't take my depression seriously and just think I'm slacking. It's not that I'm lazy or busy, I just spend 50% of the time high because I can't deal wirh being sober and the other 50% of the time trying to stab myself with a letter opener because my friend had to take all of the sharp stuff out of my apartment. But I can't tell that to my professors or they'll report me and the school will force me to go to the mental hospital again. Then I won't be able to transfer and I'll literally kill myself.  I just want to be taken seriously and get the accommodations I need, but I can't because I have to constantly toe the line of being honest and lying to avoid the US's fucked up mental health system and high risk ""prevention""."

I have had this back injury for months and I have had to stop exercising, I can do any sports and I feel as if All my work is going to waste. Its not going away and I had an MRI and found I may have to deal with this pain for life. All of the solutions they have tried have failed and I am scared I will never be able to do activities I enjoy again.

It only gets worse from their, my dream college waitlisted me and I stunned as so many people who didn’t deserve to get in got in. I had no backup plan as I was very confident I would get in, I did apply to other colleges but had no interest in attending them.  To add on to it, the girl I was talking to suddenly ghosted and then blocked me . I don’t know why I said nothing and I just feel ashamed like I did something wrong. To add on to all of this is my grandma who has gotten very sick and her condition is worsening. I have struggled to concentrate in school and have lost all motivation and my parents are mad That my grades are falling. My parents get angry that I am overreacting.

I have seen a doctor, but he suggested I take my adhd pills, but I hate relying on them and they make me feel super tired. I feel like everything is just getting worse everyday and nothing gets better. Nothing has gotten better and I don’t see anything getting better. I have stopped seeing my friends as often and I spend alot more time alone. 

I just want to get away from everything. Sometimes I just get the urge to just drive away somewhere and escape from all these problems. I just can’t take this anymore. I feel so alone and I just want to cry. I don’t know what to anymore."

Dubov2446,depression,1620632661.0,Life in college after HS,"Idk what it is, but I just cannot for the life of me move on. I had soooo many friends in hs but now I have absolutely zero, not even fake friends, I basically live in isolation at the point. With college being online the only reason I leave my room is to go to work. I haven’t even replaced my burnt out headlight from 4 days ago. Can’t sum up the energy to put on clothes and go to the store during the day time with the sun out. I met two people last year on campus but then moved away too, so that was fun. All my old friends seem to be doing good, I see them posting pics/post about marriage, babies, houses, travels, and careers and I have none of those. You know how people get seasonal depression cause the winter so dark and gloomy? That’s what summer feels like to me now. The thought of sun, light, heat, and vibrant colors make me so sad. I just want to move to Alaska and open a small shop and living in a cabin in the woods. Cold, dark, and filled with snow. Maybe one day. I did meet this girl online about three weeks ago and we’ve been taking on snap and stuff. She does make my day better but it’s not the same as having someone in person. But I’m too scared to do anything about it lol so pretty much a lost cause. Idk if this is okay but would anyone be down for a chat? It’s late at night and I don’t want to drink/cry myself to sleep tonight, a distraction would be nice. Sorry for long post, thanks for reading if you’re this far."

He has dealt with depression for several years and is in treatment and doing quite well although at times he does have bad days (as he calls them). When he does this he does not want to be around me and doesn't want me to see that side of him. He said he thinks it would ruin our relationship. He hasn't had to cancel plans with me except a couple of times. When he does I have a hard time knowing how to deal with it. I can't help being sad and disappointed and I'm not good at hiding how I feel so he usually knows. Then I feel like I'm not being understanding enough because I'm so disappointed and upset. The thing is I don't know how to not feel like that. Also when this happens it makes me want to pull back my feelings a bit. To protect myself from that disappointment. I don't know how to explain it. I want to be supportive to him, but I don't know how to and I have my own emotions I'm dealing with when this happens so then I want to protect myself. How can I deal with this and support him in a way that is healthy for us both?"

I’ve had depression(tho not clinically diagnosed due to underdeveloped medical care and mental awareness in my country)for over a decade now. Attempt suicide and hospitalization twice. 
I’ve had toxic parents who were the main causes that led me to this state b it they are what’s called “tricky family” and their narcissism doesn’t show in public, making it extremely difficult for me to receive by understanding or empathy from others.

I mean I am a generally anxious and sad person but I'm on summer break so I'm free and I have like no responsibilities to be weighing me down at the moment. So I feel like I shouldn't be feeling like this. Obviously feeling like this is never fun and great but at least I usually know why I'm sad. I guess I just got a wave of anxiety and sadness come over me and now I can't sleep and I don't know what to do.

 I definitely need a therapist and I hope to get one through my college soon (definitely by fall, maybe even in summer if I gather the courage to contact the wellness center). But until then I don't know how to cope. I usually just ignore it mostly because I don't feel like I have the time to address it with all my homework in the school year, and because I tell myself I'm just sad because of school and that's normal because everyone in my generation (gen Z) is at least a little bit depressed because of school, but now I'm feeling the same in summer and I'm realizing life might just be depressing.

I would’ve helped him in anyway possible and loved and supported him until the end of my days. Even if he couldn’t give back to me. 

He said I made him feel safe and loved and happier than anyone else. How can I make sense of this? I ask that you help me understand the perspective of a depressed person on this. It’s hard for me to understand why he would give up a source of comfort and love.

I love him so much and hate to think of him alone and in misery. And then I start to hate myself because I wonder if I was a better girlfriend  that I could have helped him and he would not leave me. The logical part of me says that I did everything I could but my heart doesn’t feel that way.  At the same time I loved him so much and he knew it. Any insight would be appreciated."

ausername-,depression,1620536675.0,All I have is love nobody ever wanted.,"I'm a really kind and sweet and affectionate person, but I don't really show it all that often. For a lot of reasons. A lot of it has to due with my social anxiety and other social shortcomings, and a lot of it has to do with my abusive childhood. I tend to withdraw often.

But even when I manage to find people I'm capable of opening up to, no one really wants to be very close to me for very long. All I want is to love, and to be loved, but nobody wants any of my love, and certainly nobody wants to love me.

It's so sad and defeating. Small, simple things mean so much to me. Being able to hug someone. To hold them. I've been touch starved for so long. In my early 20s I actually went over a year without ever touching another person - not even bumping into somebody in line at the grocery store, or brushing a cashier's hand accidentally. And for most of the other years, and the last couple of my teenage years, I didn't get touched very much more than that. It would be more common than not to have not touched anybody at all for weeks at a time. Or months. I think about how that might've affected me, sometimes.

Even growing up I was pretty touch starved - and certainly affection starved. Both toward me, but also in regards of expressing my own. I was so affectionate as a young child but when my family split up and after all those years of trauma, neglect and abuse, it left me without anybody to express those feelings toward and an inability to kind of find anybody else to serve as a surrogate.

I dunno. I'm in a relationship with someone - it's long distance - who isn't very affectionate, and sometimes I feel like my constant expressions of affection is just annoying to her. She doesn't reciprocate often, and she gets put off with my enthusiasm and excitement when she tepidly does. It's hard.

I dunno why I'm even writing all this out. I'm just laying in bed, kind of morose, and it's on my mind. Life is hard. I wish it was easier to be happy."

G-Double-D,depression,1620518746.0,Getting tired…,"Lately I’ve been feeling detached from myself. I’m coming up on my year and a half anniversary of being sober and HIV+. It’s been a lot to take in and deal with. If there ever was a time to drink it would be after that diagnosis. 
Backstory, I’ll keep it short because what I’m about to write is the reason I’m tired. Last year I had a psychotic break, fell and bashed my head on the concrete and got a concussion. At the hospital I found out I had pneumonia and encephalitis. And oh yeah, by the way, your HIV+. I spent a month in the ICU, which I don’t remember. I don’t remember 99% of that month and still don’t. Encephalitis and concussions cause memory loss and I got’em both at the same time. My short term memory is still terrible. My long term is super spotty. Things I know I should remember but can’t. My mom and little brother came to see me and I don’t remember that, and that makes me sad still. I missed Thanksgiving and Christmas. My best friend of 27 years came to see me everyday. Love him to no end. He said the nurse said I was close to death and they weren’t sure how well I’d recover cognitively. So. There’s no drinking in the ICU so that was my rehab. When I got out I had no impulse to drink. It was gone. Poof. One guy on here said I was a “spontaneous remitter” and that’s rare. I walked out sober, vegan (that happened in there too) and positive with a shitty memory. I’m tired of telling this story. Yes I know I’m a survivor. And I’m doing great. One day at a time! People with HIV live long, good lives. Blah blah blah. Coming up on this anniversary is just making me think about the last year and a half and I don’t think I’ve fully dealt with it. I realized the other day that I’d been talking  for granted that I’m alive. I almost died. I mean what do you do with that? I’m in trying to overcome that. 
So that’s why I’m tired. Could be worse. I know, but I don’t know anyone I can relate to with all this. So it just sits on my brain. I’m sure in time this anniversary and it’s impact will lessen. But the thing is, I’m impatient. =]"

chunkylubber54,depression,1620443231.0,I'm starting to think therapy is a waste of money,"I've been going to therapy on and off for years now but I think I've gotten out of it everything I can get.

My problem is emotional, but therapy can't change emotions. It only changes behavior. At my core I'm a used up former gifted kid haunted by they days when I used to feel the rush of ideas and passions through my head, and what I want more than anything else is to feel that sensation again.

But I can't.

I don't know how to get back what I lost, and it's becoming abundantly clear that nobody – not me, not my therapist, not anyone I've talked to on the internet – has any idea how to do this or even if its possible. I invest my trust in a therapist because I know I can't rely on myself, but ultimately investing that trust in someone else is equally unhealthy. It means I convince myself that they have answers when they don't, and because I fail to get the answers I'm looking for I get frustrated at the world, lash out at the people I think are withholding happiness from me, when the simple fact is there's no happiness to be had

I can't make myself happier, but I'm sure as hell making myself more miserable by continuing"

How do you smile that smile?

So convincingly coaxing

With your charm, all the while,

Driving me to the brink with your finger stroking.

Strumming me like the finest Strat

We harmonized beautifully … heavenly … blissfully…

Then, little by little, it all went flat.

According to you everything so hastily

Turned acrid and putrid... just like that!

Then from where I cannot tell you

You blasted a dagger razor sharp and true.

So head-over-heels and trusting, I was completely blindsided,

Before I could grasp the reality of one,

A second hit me, as I hit my knees so misguided,

And then a third struck, and I was done.

Who are you?

I hear you talking.

It sounds like you.

But my love wouldn’t leave me choking,

Trying to breathe through all the tears.

Who ARE you?

You look like my man.

But my love would take me in his arms

And hold me as close as he can.

That’s what he’d do, that’s what he’d do,

That’s what HE'D DO!"

thegreatsoyaman,depression,1620561097.0,I disappeared yesterday and no one even noticed.,"Yesterday morning I packed my things and drove 1500 kms with full intention of never returning. I was going to keep driving and driving until I couldn't anymore and then end it. My mother was the only one who actually noticed my absence and after the 4th voicemail my conscience got the better of me and I turned around. I didn't peace out for attention but I think it's funny how not a single friend of mine even realize how close they came to losing me. Not a single message from anyone in the 16 hours of driving I did. I'd wager a week could go by and still no one would know or even care. It's absolutely pathetic.

I'm struggling to rationalize any reason not to just leave again. I'm in my 30s and it's always been this way ever since I was a kid. It's no one's fault, no outer forces making my life like this; it's me. And as long as I'm stuck having to live in my own skin my life will always be full of heartbreak and loneliness. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. This world is so much more Darwinian than anyone ever wants to admit and unfortunately I'm one of the rejects. I'll never be good enough for anyone. I've been trying to improve my life with hard work but it's futile because as long I am fundamentally me no one will ever want me. There's nothing to live for; nothing to work for and persevere for. I'm worth nothing and that's the truth. That's reality."

fckmymil,depression,1620465067.0,Lying to my therapist,"I've been depressed most of my life. Honestly I don't think I can remember a time when I wasn't depressed, although I'm sure I was a fairly happy kid. I've been in therapy on and off for the past few years, but only started going regularly after losing my brother and nephew to a car accident last year. 

Thing is I lie to her every session. Tell her I'm doing better than I am. Accomplishing goals when I'm not. I know this defeats the purpose of therapy but I don't think it's any of her business. I only go so I can get the prescription for antidepressants that at least make sure I'm functioning and can take care of my kids.

I've always felt ambivalent about being alive. Now that my brother is gone I know I can't do anything to cause my parents further pain. To deprive my husband and kids. But dammit I'm pissed that I can't just shut it all off. I just realized that I can't even remember the last time I brushed my teeth. I only shower every day because with two kids it's the only alone time and peace I get. It's a crap shoot whether I actually wash or just sit in the water. 

I dont want to die because of the pain it would cause my family, but I am just so fucking tired. All of the time. And I just want the pain to stop."

And whenever I don't talk about depression he thinks that I don't have it anymore and that I'm cured if I laugh or some dumb bullshit like that. We hanged out a few weeks ago and he told me ""you don't seem depressed to me"" and IT MADE ME SO MAD. Yesterday, I told him I hated the world and that I want to die.

A little background about me I am a 24F and my relationship with my dad is not the best. For all of my life my dad has been working so when I was younger I didn’t see him much because he would say he was always working. Sometimes he would tell me he would see me on the weekends but never show up. When I did see him it was only for a few hours then he would leave. I don’t know much about his side of the family I don’t know where he lives I don’t know his mom or dad. A lot of information I’m missing and it’s like the half of me is missing. This also is causing issues when it comes to me dating or having men in my life. Most of them are just like him in some ways. But I’ve told my therapist about how I don’t know much about him like his family where he lives where he is from etc.. my therapist always tells me I should reach out to him and ask him these things. I was supposed to do that today but I just could t bring myself to asking him. I don’t even know how to do it. I know this is weird but I don’t really know him so it gives me anxiety whenever I have to talk to him. It’s taking me a very long time to go forth with having this conversation with him it’s not easy and I’m just so overwhelmed with this. It’s frustrating. My next session with my therapist is Monday and I’m afraid to tell my therapist I still can’t bring myself to ask him. It’s kind of embarrassing for me too because I’m older now and I still struggle with this."
Kraymur,depression,1620533639.0,I'm so fucking tired.,"I don't even really know how to start this off, I haven't been happy in what seems like a decade. It started when me and my HS girlfriend broke up (my fault.) and honestly I thought i'd recover but it seems to just weigh me down. This isn't the reason for my writing, it's just one of the earliest times I could think back to before I stopped being the person I was. I had friends, I was quick witted and well read, I didn't really have a problem with talking to people (atleast compared to what I am now.) I ended up homeless for a little while when my moms landlord kicked us out, the landlady had alot of issues, needless to say we ended up in tents at a campground for a year until we were about to move to a small town after my mom got a car loan. This new town is horrible, I don't drive so work is extremely limited, everyone here is the complete opposite of me (farmers, meth heads, low-tier gangmembers.) I've been unemployed for 2 months at this point and the only available jobs are Warehousing and Manufacturing - jobs i've worked for years that have burnt me out but even those aren't calling me back with my years of experience. I just, I DON'T want to work myself out of this. I'm done trying to pull myself up and just get down again. I started off poor as shit, my mom met a good duy after my father left and she cheated on him because she has issues regarding ""bad boys"" being her type. Ruined my fucking life for a dalliance with a gang banger, we lived good with my new dad, he was amazing, cared about us, provided a good living, he left when I was 13 after my mom had us move in with her and her piece of shit boyfriend. My whole life has been highs and lows, it's never been constant. I have crippling social anxiety from a mixture of being bullied, generally overbearing and controlling parent (mom) and what not. My social skills are completely drained at this point because I just... didn't want to BE AROUND other people after my girlfriend and I had broken up so I just shut myself in.   


I know what I need to do to get better, but I have no want or willpower to do it, I would be content to stop existing at this very moment. I don't want empathy, I know people go through what I do on a daily basis, I don't want opinions on how to fix my situation - i've known for awhile. I just don't want any of this anymore. I don't want money, I dont want a family, I dont want nice things, I don't want to work some bullshit job anymore just so I can barely afford rent and basic things and I sure as shit don't want to spend years and get myself into debt for the offchance of finding a good job with some bullshit degree. Why is this so fucking hard, I feel like people are swimming by me and i'm just barely able to keep my head above water, stuck in the same fucking spot just barely keeping from drowning. And the response to this? ""swim harder"" ""just try a little harder"" Ive been trying my entire fucking life, telling myself ""this doesn't define me"" ""I can make myself better"" ""I can undo what's been done by just being better"" It. hasn't. worked. I have no friends, and I don't blame them. I can't converse with people anymore, my mind just goes blank and reverts to small talk bullshit that noone likes. I don't follow up with people because I noticed if I don't message them first they'll just not talk to me anymore.   


At this point my mom is the only thing keeping me going, but she's fucked in the head worse than I am, thinking she's psychic and shit and everything to do with her just drags me down even more. I can't do this anymore as much as I want to. I have no want to do good things anymore, I have no desire to be a better person or make myself into who I thought i'd be. I want to die."
idontexist1300,depression,1620442392.0,I’m going crazy and I can’t tell anyone,"These last few months have been the best and worst months I’ve experienced in my life. I (20M) have decided I’m going to quit my college sport because I don’t have a passion for it anymore. Ive done sports my entire life and I’m truly tired and have nothing more to give in that part of life. The issue is my father won’t give me a break. I told him I’m going to quit a few months ago but he keeps trying to manipulate me into playing “one more season”. That’s what he says every time. But every time I tell him no he tries to make it like I’m doing him a disservice by making a decision that’s best for me. I’m really tired of being manipulated by my parents because they’ve even gone as far as hinting that they’d no longer support me financially if I choose to make my own decisions for my life. The mind games and manipulations have always been there and I’m seeing it now more than ever. On top of that I have no control over my money. I have a pretty nice chunk of money saved up from working but my parents have access to my bank account and don’t let me see a penny unless they see fit. They literally have full control over everything I do. I eat away at my money sometimes but a lot of times I want to invest it for something that will benefit my career but I have to get their approval first and 9/10 times I get a “no” or “later” from them.
Another major issue is that my closest friend and confidant (my girlfriend) is pushing me away from her. She recently told me “I doubt you’d be a committed father”. That stung because how can you even draw that conclusion let alone say it out loud to me. I’ve given her no reason to doubt my commitment. I’ve told her I’m not ready for kids but the fact that she thinks I’m incapable of being committed to them if I had them is heartbreaking. I think she uses the fact that I don’t like being tasked with babysitting kids that aren’t mine as a reason that I wouldn’t be there for MY kids and I don’t see the correlation at all. What really pisses me off is that she has a plethora of her own issues that I’d never use against her especially when it comes to her ability to commit even though SHE’S the one with commitment issues so who does she think she is to judge my character in that way? Ive been the poster boyfriend for her, she and her family have pointed it out several times but lately it’s rare that I feel like she’s there for me. She’s been very dismissive about how I feel when she says certain stuff. And I never here good job from her anymore. She’s always critiquing what I do and say. I know I can do things better in my life in terms of effort and I try but it’s not like I’m behind the curve or on pace to be a bum. I’m lazy at times but it doesn’t hinder my progress in life in any way. What’s crazy is know matter how much she screws up I always uplift her but when I mess up she makes me feel like I lack common sense.

This is all overwhelming because whether it’s my family or my girlfriend it feels like any move I make is never the right one. Im supposed to be able to talk to both about my feelings but I can’t talk to either. I’m always being criticized and manipulated and when I want to make a decision that’s best for me no one wants to support it. I feel like I’ve never had control over my life and I want it so bad but everyone seems to ignore my feelings. I cried for the first time in a while today because I can’t talk to anyone about how I feel without them invalidating my emotions. I’m tired and it’s making me lose my motivation to move my life forward. I just want everyone to disappear until I can get my own life together. I don’t feel loved or appreciated right now. It feels like im paying a debt to everyone when in actuality I owe no one nothing"

field-of-daisies,depression,1620531899.0,kind of exhausted with life,"**don't worry, not gonna off myself**

sounds like the beginning of a popular teen novel, but don't worry folks: my life, although boring, isn't as repetitive and bland as said popular teen novel (there are some exceptions but i am not here to talk about that today, though i'm always interested in chatting about novels), and it's more repetitive in the high school bell schedule type of way. i do the same things every day but sometimes in one of the tasks i do (here is where i insert that high school bell schedule analogy: sometimes in one of the classes) something inconvenient happens, like i forget to brush my teeth for a week (or a fight breaks out at 7 am, seriously what was up with high school)----and at first its annoying but as the week(s) progress you get used to it type of repetitive, and you sit with that disgusting taste in your mouth and wonder why life is so........like this. why life is so tiring and boring and grey.

sometimes i wonder if i've always been this way, because whenever i feel like i am happy again, it feels almost fake. like i made up the feeling in my head, and now i'm back to normal, this dysthymic, indifferent mood on the outside and chaos inside. i find myself overthinking things too much with my relationship (i also have bpd, so that's pretty much always going on in my head) which drive me into long nights staring at the ceiling wondering if i will push him away farther than i have because i'm so... like this. i find myself wondering if i could ever amount to anything, like if i could ever go back to college after dropping out last october (because i was psychotically depressed), and if i could ever actually earn my bachelors, hell-----could i ever really earn a masters? 

i'm just kind of at the exhausted plate of life right now. where i don't really know what to do, i kinda just put this nice face on for everyone (at home, at work, generally just in public) but i'm suffering, intensely. i hate speaking about things out loud so here i am speaking about them on the internet. i am so tired. i don't even feel sad, to be honest with you----i am so calm but not. i am so tired. that's really it.

I am so totally out of sync with the average person, that I really think that there is no coming back at this point.  Life has been a series of defeats and the only control that I feel that I could wrest from my life is upon ending it.  I want to make the people around me proud, but then life beats me into submission.  I am getting more fucked up by the day.  I will drink myself to death soon, at least, I hope.  My liver or gallbladder or something hurts every day, but I will probably drink again tomorrow.  I am sad that I couldn't make those that care about me proud, but at this point that probably isn't even possible, and death would be preferable.  I have struggled with this menace for 15 years, and nothing has changed.  It is probably my own fault, but even knowing that, it doesn't make it any better.  Nothing feels possible.  Nothing feels pleasurable.  This world is decayed and corrupted, and there are only closed doors.  That is what it looks like to me at least.  How can people be happy with the status quo?  I can't stand it.  I ask myself if I can stand another year, or 5, or 10.  And the answer is - ""No"".  I cannot.  That seems like an impossible challenge."

hiddenboi6,depression,1620569284.0,"Thinking of bettering my life at times, then it just fades away.","In short, i’ve been living my life on repeat essentially for the past two years. Ever since I’ve graduated highschool I’ve had... no plans for anything. I’m a NEET, basically.

I’ve had my own share of troubles and conflict. Sometimes I really like to imagine myself fixing my issues, mending hurt relationships with friends, and actually finding motivation. But once I snap back to reality it’s hard to even start on anything. I have so many things I would like to say or do to make things better but it’s just difficult for me to even get started.

I feel like a burden to everyone else around me. I’ve provided nothing. I can’t drive, never had a job, not even in college, no experience whatsoever. I still feel like a child despite being an adult. My own parents even treat me like a child, I’ve heard them crack “jokes” and gossip about me to other family members at times. I feel like i’m not appreciated anywhere. 

My parents aren’t abusive, they do care for me. But in short I’m also afraid of them. I feel like I have to constantly wear a mask around my family, and try to minimize any interactions with them often. I often feel like I’m a disappoint and they know it. I used to be a straight A, honor roll student until sometime in High school where I just burnt out and fell into a downwards spiral. I never really recovered since.

I often feel like i’m putting up a facade. I find myself lying to make others hear what they want to hear, to make myself appear socially acceptable. I’m so sick and tired of feeling fake but I’m tired of embarassing myself.

Kirbinder,depression,1620574060.0,Apparently you can avoid having periods!,"For those who don't want a period, my doc told me I can get nexplanon (birth control inserted into your arm) or take birth control pills 💊 and skip the placebo week to never have periods again. Doc also said it is okay to not have periods, will not harm you to not have periods. 

Why have I never herd of this before? I have PMDD, do you know how much pain and depression I could have avoided if I started doing this 10 or 15 years ago."
Just_Long_3438,depression,1620511570.0,Can anybody explain this feeling?,"I had a dream last night about a concert I went to, which the two year anniversary for is in a couple days. And I woke up feeling extremely sad. Like my heart actually feels like there’s a brick sitting on it and I want to cry. Why do I feel like this? I mean, yeah I’ve gotten sad looking back on that day because I consider it one of the happiest days of my life, and I’m confident I’ll never be that happy again. Especially since there were friends I had then that are no longer my friends now. And in general I was on such a euphoric high that when it was over I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. I was planning on going to another concert for the same band last year, but that didn’t happen for obvious reasons. Still, why am I just so utterly miserable? I haven’t felt this truly hopeless and sad I think ever. It’s like somebody’s taken a part of my heart and crushed it. With me never to get it back. Does anybody know what this feeling is or what’s causing it? I do have depression and anxiety but this is on another level. I was even sad in the dream because I knew the end was inevitable and it made me miserable to the point that when I woke up, I was sad and wanting to cry. I’m actually crying now as I type. What is going on??"

My family knows I'm depressed. I told my mom and she told everyone else just like she always tells everyone everything, even if it's something private.In my family nobody talks about their feelings. When I told my mom about my depression I literally said 'oh btw my therapist said I'm depressed lol' and when tried to tell her might be depressed years ago she literally laughed at me. Anyways- To this day I have been masking it for other people so well that it looks like I am completely fine. It really takes it toll on me it costs a lot of energy and when I get back home I break down. It's just that I don't know how much longer I can keep it up. I don't know what to do because I literally want to die but I just don't know how to tell anyone that I can't come visit them because it's too much. I also don't want to cut them off entirely because they mean well. Does anyone have any experience with this or any advice? Thanks in advance :)"
focusrunner79,depression,1620587430.0,I'm starting to view life differently,"I'm curious to see if anyone else is experiencing this. I've struggled with severe anxiety and moderate depression for years. Within the past year, I developed a condition called parosmia because of COVID. Basically, it makes it so almost anything with a scent and flavor smells and tastes like trash.

Now, I've been a huge foodie my entire life, and food has been a primary source of happiness for a majority of my life. And now, I enjoy food 50%. Sometimes I have a meal and wash it down just so I don't have to suffer through the taste and smell of it.

Now I can't tell myself ""It will get better."" These past couple years, my goal has been to find a good paying job so I can afford all the food I want. And right when I get that job, paying $17/hr + commission, I get this condition.

I'm at the point where I feel like I'm living life through a television screen. I've emotionally detached from almost everything. It feels like everything I see, hear, feel, I'm experiencing it second hand. I don't feel the emotions I used to. Knowing that I'm depressed and one of my only sources of happiness is gone, I just don't feel connected to life.

The only benefit to this condition and my severe anxiety is I don't fear death anymore. I love falling asleep, and hate waking up most days."

i feel like calling someone to check on her would just make this situation worse because if she gets hospitalized or something i know she’ll be extremely mad at me, and i dont feel comfortable telling any of our other friends because either they don’t know or if i tell them im worried they’ll then tell her what i said and then she’ll get mad at me and do something irrational because she has said multiple times she doesn’t want to see a therapist or anything even though thays probably the best option at this point. 

i just can’t handle not being sure if i’m going to wake up and she’s going to be gone anymore and i don’t know what to do."

VokkLuka,depression,1620452835.0,I am a huge coward and a complete failure,"  

This is probably the first time ever that I opened up my depression to someone else. It’s probably gonna be really long, so someone might not finish this. And English is not my first language you see, so there would be a lot of mistake and my choice of words and sentences might be not really good.

I just feel so tired right now. So I’m from South-East Asia and in here, parents’ words are very important and it is just the tradition here. It is almost impossible to change now for me. So during Covid-19 I come home to live with my parents because I’m 22, don’t have a job, still in college with not very good grade. I keep trying u know help around the house, housework. But for all things you do, they will all down fall to just one mistake. Then here come “These day, you are doing nothing. All you is eat. Not helping around…” much more. I did tried talk back a few things only to worsen the mood. I just don’t what to do to please them.

When I was in middle school, my parents have to become worker in South-Korea to make money to support family. During that time, kids grow very slowly. I didn’t feel much at first. Without knowing, I start to feel distant from everyone. I start to be by myself more and more. I can’t focus on my study. And when I fail one test with was quite important but won’t affect my final grade, it was a hard fall. I just can’t get up. 

In college, it just got worsen. My memory start failing my choice of subject is completely off. Interior design for one year was a no because it is expensive and not my type of thing to do. IT third now, my mind is now just tired. I can’t focus. I should have choose Foreign Language. But now I’m scared cause I’m using my parents’ money for college payment. And it is third year now. I feel like a complete failure and really afraid to talk to my parents about it.  What to do?

Idk why but I’m really scared of getting a job even a part time. I can hardly breathe when thinking about moving forward to try new things. And I’m not close to my friend as before as I start to get depression.

I’m gay but I never open up about it. No one know I am one except for one of my friend but he was really rich and hanging out with him just feel so awkward. I only had one crush in high school which I confessed him when I’m in college which was failure. And I haven’t speak to him since. So I never really been in relationship. Maybe I can find one?? Nahhh I’m not a good looking guy, too tall to be a bottom, too skiny ( I have been in the same 48 kg for 5 years now never gain any weight). Gym? I just don’t have time and feel really embarrassed about going. I am too afraid to be in a real relationship.

I’m a very boring person. I’m bored of things really fast even game. I can’t chat for long. I start feel bored and run out of topic to talk about really fast which make me afraid of chatting with someone else cause I’m afraid I might upset them.

So this is it. Thank you guys for reading this. There are a lot more but these are things that are mainly really not in good way right now. Also I’m feel much better while writing this which make me really sleepy. I did think of suicide a couple time but never get to do it. Thank guys!!"

But then the night comes and there’s that 3 hours before bed when the wheels in my mind start to turn and the saddens and pain and despair and emptiness comes back. There’s no reason for it, I’m not sick, no one in my family is dying, I have great friends and school and in the day I feel ok. But I’m realizing that my sadness is just their because I won’t acknowledge past trauma and past experiences. I won’t acknowledge the pain I’ve gone through because I don’t know what to do with it. And I need help but I can’t afford it so I’m stuck in a viscous cycle where everyday I want to die when I wake up so I distract myself till I’m so exhausted I’ll pass out and my pain and emotions get ignored until they burst out. And I can’t stop, I know what I need but I don’t want help, I don’t want change because my pain has been by my side my whole life. Is there even anything else? Do I even deserve happiness?

Funky_Goggles,depression,1620432184.0,My teeth and dental work have sent me into my worst depression and at this point I just don't want teeth anymore,"Not sure if this belongs here or in a different sub or of it even belongs in a sub at all...if anyone has suggestions on where else to put this mess of a post let me know and I'll take it down.

I recently went to the dentist after 3 years. I was never great at taking care of my teeth (mostly due to mental health reasons), and I avoided going to the dentist because of anxiety. Well, turns out I need a lot of dental work done. I have multiple cavities (more than 10), need two crowns, had a root canal and possibly might need another root canal for a different tooth. I decided to start all this work because I wanted to be more confident in my self and in my smile, but it's having the opposite effect.

Three weeks ago I had fillings done on 3/4ths of my mouth. Ever since then my bite has just been off. Everytime I close my mouth to chew something they feel like they knock into each other. I've gone to my dentist at least 4 times to get them adjusted but he never adjusts them right. I tell him while I'm in the chair that they are still off and he basically tells me to deal with it. Last week I went in everyday to get them adjusted and I'm still stuck with pain and the inability to chew or close my mouth.

One of my teeth had an infection for nine months. I was dealing with it, but needed a root canal. A few days ago my dentist thought that the pain I was having from the bad adjustments on the fillings was due to the pain of the infected tooth, so he scheduled me an emergency root canal. I'm now in pain from that, plus I'm still in pain from the badly adjusted fillings. 

I still need the two crowns (one being on the tooth with the root canal I just had done) and the last 1/4th of my cavities done. I might also need another root canal for a different tooth.

I haven't eaten solid food in 3 weeks. I've broken down in tears and had panic attacks every other, and sometimes every day, from the pain of my teeth and the frustration of not being able to eat real food. My boyfriend asks me if I want to get pizza or some other solid food and I have to say no even though I want that food so bad. I know the minute I start chewing and those fillings hit each other, I know I'll be in intense pain so therefore I can't eat solid food. I'm so sick of applesauce, yogurt, pudding, mashed potatoes and ice cream. It's been three weeks and I just want to eat some real food. I've lost 10 pounds because I'm not getting the proper nutrients for my body no matter how much food I eat. 

Let's add in the financial stress too. I'm 23 and on state insurance so basically nothing is covered and I'm paying for this out of pocket. My parents refuse to help and I just graduated college last year. With COVID, I'm unable to get a job in my field so I'm stuck working a minimum wage job that I don't even want to go to anymore because I'm so depressed and in pain from my teeth.

I also work night shift and my dentist is only open 9-5, which is when I sleep. So, I've been getting very little sleep in an attempt to try and make my teeth better and to not be in pain. The fact that I have to keep going to the dentist daily is making me lose sleep and lose my mind.

I'm also ruining my relationship with my boyfriend because all I do is complain to him about my teeth or that my teeth hurt. Even when I don't mean to. He knows something is wrong and everytime intell him it's my teeth he does a big sigh and I can tell he's sick of me telling him. When I have mental breakdowns because of it, I know he is just comforting me because he has no other choice. I feel so bad because I'm being a horrible girlfriend who just wants to cry and complain about my teeth. I haven't been intimate or spent any time with him because of the mental state I'm in and because of the pain I'm in. It's only a matter of time before he breaks up with me over this.

I'm so sick of my teeth, I honestly sometimes wish that they would just be knocked out of my face so I didn't have to deal with them and the stress they are causing me. They have caused me more harm than good. They hurt, they're causing me not to be able to eat properly, they're ruining my sleep schedule, they're ruining my finances, they're ruining my relationship with my boyfriend and they're ruining my mental health. I'm mentally drained and I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up crying because of all the harm they've done to my life in the past few months. Like during my breakdowns I have suicidal thoughts over this stress of my teeth. (Want to disclose that I'm not feeling suicidal right now, but in the past have been suicidal over my teeth and got help for it). I wish I never would have gone to the dentist to find out what work I needed done. All it did was put me in a worse place."
Skullmaggot,depression,1620632645.0,Deadlines and what may have been the source of my stress.,"I think deadlines have been causing me undue stress, but I suppose the easiest way to rethink them is to just be comfortable getting things done past their deadline. That way, your output is more accommodating to your energy and mood, and your health is prioritized over arbitrary due dates. Being okay with getting things done after the due date relieves some stress about getting it done, which allows you to work more efficiently, which paradoxically gives you a greater chance of getting it done before the deadline anyway!

Hope this is of some help.

Anyways about two years ago he was dying . My birth mother told me  but I didn't believe her because she's been fucked up to my birth siblings and I was so focused on work back then.

It makes me so sad to think about. I didn't even go to his funeral because of social anxiety and not being able to drive but thats really not an excuse. I havent thought about this in so long because i hate thinking about it.

Like my anxiety
And personal hang ups just kept me from being there and i hate myself for it. 

I really wish i knew him. My birth mother just wanted to put me on her section 8 and dangle a living space over my head(she did this to my sister who literally had nowhere else to go)

Last week we.msde.plans for him to come over today, I don't get weekends off and I work sometimes up to 10 days in a row with only one day off and specifically requested Sunday off to see my friend.

Neither of us realized at the time that today was mother's day and I'm assuming he cancelled because he hasn't shown up or called yet.

GhosKatt,depression,1620625841.0,I made my mom cry on Mother's Day,"It's not that my mom is the worst but I do blame her for being part of the reason why I suffer from depression and violent tendencies. I don't even know if I love her anymore, I think I used to before, but now I'm just numb. All I feel towards her is just hate, she destroyed my every bit of love for her.

Others might call me ungrateful, heck, I even think of myself as ungrateful but I just can't forgive the things she did to me, and it outweighs all the good things she'd done for me. She told me that I never thought of her as a mother and she's right, I can't respect her as a mother because she never acted like a mother towards me. Even if she guilt trips me by saying how she carried me in her belly for 9 months and cared for me when I was a baby, how am I able to remember all that? All I remember are the bad things and how I always regretted ever being born. And when I tell her about her mistakes, she doesn't even admit to it but blames me for everything instead. I can't even show my sadness, anger, frustrations towards her because she would just get mad at it. She tells me that I make her feel like she failed as a parent, the fact that I get jealous of other people's mothers already shows how much she failed at it.

I told her I never asked to be born, I was her mistake, she should've just aborted me, she should have just killed me, and yes I did try to attempt it on Mother's Day but I chickened out the last minute. She feeds me, gave me clothes and shelter? Isn't that because she'll face child abuse and neglect if she didn't do all that? And it's not her that did any of that stuff, it's only my dad that is working hard just to provide me those things, and it's only my dad who places any effort towards me. My dad tells me to apologize to her for making her cry the whole night on mother's day, but I can't bring myself to do it.  I don't even know if she loves me or not, she never made me feel loved but she tells me everything I said makes her feel heartbroken. She probably loves me but just someone who is full of flaws, but it doesn't excuse her abuse towards me. Tell me, am I such a bad person to make their mother cry on mother's day?

Aylalito,depression,1620588314.0,i think i just realized how depressed i actually am and im sad,"i just had my boyfriend over for 2 days, first time i’ve had him over in weeks. and he just went home again. and right before he was going to go i started crying so bad. i broke. and after he went home i let it all out fully and i’ve been crying intensely for the past 30 minutes. cuz well i love him a lot and get sad everytime he has to go home. but that’s not my point here, it all made me realize how depressed i’ve been. because now i know im gonna go right back to that very depressed, partly numb place where i just wish i didn’t exist. i’ve been trying to get better but have actually been getting worse the past weeks. and i think i just realized how bad it ‘s been because my boyfriend being here made me feel so much more again. everyday i dont really care that im so depressed, probably because i am depressed. so now that i’ve had him over , taking me more out of that depressed state, i realize how down bad i really am and i don’t wanna be. its awful. its painful. but when im in it its also kinda comfortable. but rn i just see how bad it really is. but i dont know what to do about it. and im sad that im probably gonna watch myself fall back into it any moment. i also realize how messed up my mind is everyday and tbh it’s frightening. it’s frightening how that is usually my normal state. i feel so lost tbh. i thought i didn’t anymore, but now i realize i do.
i also feel guilty for being so depressed when i have such an amazing person so close to me in my life. the depression isnt fully gone when he is here. and it makes me feel horrible because i love him so much and he is the best thing to ever happen to me yet i am depressed.
it also made me realize how alone i am. how little people have love for me. i mean i knew, it just hit differently now. i cut off my toxic family. i currently dont really have friends. probably my fault. i used to have friends. i dont know what friendships are anymore. i changed and want friendships differently that before. these things dont bother me at all usually. but idk it just hits me because my boyfriend has friends and and his family. don’t get me wrong im very very grateful for him. so grateful. but i kinda also feel like a failure and useless and like nobody, non worthy or lovable etc.
please someone say something, i haven’t poured my heart out like this in a very long time."

I know covid has made it hard for everyone. We struggled to pay rent and keep food on the table. I used all my savings and stimulus for food and rent. I started to experience health issues during covid but i had lost my health insurance because I couldn't pay it after losing my job, due to covid. I knew I couldn't see a doctor I couldn't afford it. Then it got to the point where I just had to talk to a doctor, there were no in person meetings only telephone call. Every call charged me 450$ but luckily there was some financial assitance so I only owed 180$ after every call. But those phone calls just had me going around in circles, taking the same tests never finding anything and still experiencing symptoms. My doctor told me to go Urgent care if my symptoms got worse. About 2 months later they did, I asked my girlfriend to take me to the hospital so I can go into the urgent care to get checked out. This was my only option, because there is no in person doctor appointments. As I was walking in I vomited all over myself, and nearly loss consciousness. I was helped inside by a nurse and they drew blood. In my already weakened state the blood draw had me passing out, I couldn't breathe. This was the first time I ever experienced when drawing blood. They put me in the ER and did all these tests I already did. They couldn't find anything. Now I'm stuck with a nearly  $10k medical bill when I just want to know whats wrong and I still don't know.

Rolls_,depression,1620458002.0,Losing hope,"This is kinda a long story but imma try to keep it short. Basically tho, I'm quickly losing hope and don't see a point. Don't feel like I'm really meant for this world.

&#x200B;

About 6yrs ago, I told myself I would end it in 5 years if I didn't improve my life. I succeeded. Got rid of social anxiety and normal anxiety, made friends, improved my grade to a 3.9 gpa in Uni and am now graduating. Didn't fix the depression and now I just have more stuff to get depressed over.

Recently, got rejected from a program that would have me work over seas. I asked my best friend out a couple months ago, got rejected. Became much better friends after that though. later, found out she has a thing for an old hs friend that lives out of state, and a vacation we planned together was in large part so she can hook up with this friend. So, I'm no longer going to do that trip.

I have a lot of other stuff going on, but those are some things I had hope for recently. This year I gave myself a hard deadline for when I would finally end it, created a plan, everything. Decided to do it after graduation, so a couple weeks from now. Unfortunately tho, my friend convinced me to stick around for a while (I opened up to her about my depression after we started getting really close. Asshole thing to do, I know). Now I can't even connect to that suicidal part of me. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Planned on ending things, finally gave myself a hard deadline. So many things I was looking forward to turned out bad. Worst part is my friend convinced me to not kms. Now I just have to live with this shit until I get that feeling back. No longer see the point."

goddamn__goddamn,depression,1620499754.0,Worried abt meds making me feel numb when I already do...?,"I'm unsure of where to turn, but I think I've been depressed my whole life and just never realized? Most of my friends who are depressed are suicidal or experience very deep lows, and since I have none of that I never thought I could be depressed.

I just have a steady lack of desire to do anything, plus insomnia, plus an almost nonexistent sex drive the past few years. No interest in cooking or feeding myself (but I really do like food). I haven't had extreme emotions one way or the other in  a long, long time, I feel pretty steady, it's just a steady....apathy. Like things can still make me laugh, but I rarely cry or feel anything too deeply. I've lost a few friends over the past two years and I might cry for a minute or two when I find out but then I'm almost over it already? I've even sat with a friends body for 2 days during a home funeral and I was the only one not crying.

I also have ADHD and want to try meds finally (I'm 31) but I worry about all the stories I hear of folks feeling numb. And I know some ppl like that cause it feels like the fog of doom has lifted for them, but I don't need that. I need motivation. To do anything, literally I'd settle for motivation to shower more or cook breakfast.

TryingMyBest69420,depression,1620432974.0,Psych told me I have depression but I don't feel depressed?,"So, first thing to note: I have been diagnosed with depression before and am on meds to manage it and OCD, but I only really had one major depressive episode years ago. I went on meds immediately afterwards and I haven't felt that depression related level of misery and sadness since. I had a really major OCD episode years ago that also resulted in me feeling that miserable, but that was due to the intrusive thoughts I was having so it wasn't necessarily a depression thing.

So, I've been on meds for depression and OCD for years now and I've always felt that it was well managed and the depression/OCD was basically gone? I almost always feel neutral/calm and often experience happiness at points during the day a lot of days and when I'm with family/friends. Sometimes I'll have passive suicidal thoughts, but that's only in reaction to stressful situations (often concerning my future and academics) and I've never thought of it as a big deal.

For a while (years) now, I've noticed myself struggling with a lot of things though. I easily get distracted when doing chores and work, forget things way more than other people, have a lot of trouble even initiating important everyday tasks (like eating consistently, hygiene, getting out of bed), feel tired ALL the time, etc. Completing large projects and tasks is especially difficult for me, even when I understand the content it is based on, and feels like too much brainpower and I get distracted with other things even when I WANT to complete it. This all got so severe that I had to withdraw from the semester b/c I just couldn't DO anything, couldn't do any work or eat consistently or get out of bed consistently or anything bc it just felt like too much effort or I couldn't focus on it for long. But through it all I never felt the level of misery/sadness/hopelessness I had known to be from depression.

So I searched it up, thought I might have inattentive adhd b/c I wasn't experiencing any feelings of being depressed and my inability to function was severe, saw a psych to get tested only to be told I actually show high markers for depression and OCD, which I had thought was so well managed by my meds that it was basically nonexistent. I'm so frustrated bc how can I still be displaying depression when I don't even feel depressed? I even asked my mom, who I live with bc my college is online for the semester, if I've seemed depressed and she said no. Shouldn't my depression meds have helped with my executive dysfunction if it is depression related? I'm just frustrated and confused right now."
-justkeepsmiling-,depression,1620446908.0,Boyfriend wants to breakup because i’m always sad,"TW: rape


Backstory:
About 2.5 months ago, I was raped by a guy I met at a party. Me and my boyfriend were broken up at the time for a few weeks and had just started talking as friends again that week. After it happened, I was broken and suicidal and stayed with him most of the time while dealing with the initial shock of it all. During that time, I realized I still had romantic feelings for him and we began dating again after a little. 

The current situation:
Yesterday my boyfriend and I had a talk where he was really close to breaking up with me. I’ve been dealing with an investigation into the rape which has made me fall back into a depressive hole. He said that since I’m sad all the time, it’s affecting him negatively and stressing him out. He said he thinks I’m ok with being upset and he feels like a caregiver to me. It takes so much effort for me to even get out of bed and go about my day but I don’t know how to fix this. He’s been my biggest support through this and I don’t want to lose him. I’m seeing a therapist and trying my best to heal and be happy but it’s felt almost impossible lately. I don’t want him to be stressed and sad because of me, but I don’t want to break up with him.

Any advice or anything would be helpful because I feel completely lost on what the right thing to do is at this point."

I was always struggling with anxiety. I was quiet. The weird kid. I realise now it was anxiety. Later I gained depression as well.

In 2000 my Nan died. I was very young. Just nine years old. She died of cancer. She was misdiagnosed and they thought it was gall stones. Nope. Cancer. She died in her 60's. I loved her to bits. I still do, actually. I miss her.

That was the first loss I had.

Growing up I was bullied a lot. I'm skinny, so naturally was a target for bullies. I was slapped. Punched. Called names like ""anorexic"", ""gollum"" ... I'd accidentally brush past people in the school corridors and they'd say ""ew it touched you!"". School sucked. I had a best friend who would bully me and steal my food.

When I was in high-school my bedroom caught fire. My brother and I had been arguing about something - at the time our relationship wasn't the best - and I stormed outside. It was a good job I did, because not long after my brother came running outside saying there was a fire. I lost most of my teddies, clothes, bed, belongings, and my little pet hamster. 

I got a boyfriend. And then that boyfriend decided to assault someone with a hammer and then reveal he was on the run from the police. Excellent.

I left school with shredded self-esteem and no self-confidence.

We were in trouble as a family with bailiffs. My dad borrowed money off someone who may or may not have been a loan shark just to make ends meet. Eventually he fell behind payments. We had people coming into the house taking down the value of all of our items in case my dad couldn't pay and they had to repossess things. I found letters growing up - accidentally while looking for other things - that were summoning my dad to court for rent arrears.

My mum was an emotional wreck. She had terrifying tempers and threatened us with violence. She'd smash things. Throw things. Shout at us. Blame my dad that everything went wrong. Take off her wedding ring and throw it across the room.

When I went into Uni things were OK-ish. I graduated with a BSc.

I went on a date with another ex from school. He wanted sex. He tried to do ""things"" with me, but couldn't get turned on. He broke up with me afterwards.

After Uni I didn't get the job I wanted. Signed on JobSeekers. My brother moved away to Scotland to live with his then-girlfriend. My dad worked late nights. My mum was absorbed with her computer. I was essentially alone. I was on minimum wage and couldn't move out because I couldn't afford it.

My granddad died, which was a horrible experience for several reasons. For the obvious, and also because he hated my dad. And in turn most of the family on my mum's side hated us too. We were made to feel like we weren't welcome at the funeral. While all my cousins rode behind the hearse, we were stuck in a hire car trying to find somewhere to park. By the time we got to the church the service was over.

I still didn't find a job I really wanted. And when I was stuck in a call-centre job, I came home one night and my mum told me we were moving. We'd been evicted.

I remember one night my dad went out to get drunk. He came home and broke down entirely, crying onto my shoulder. I remember he also reached out for my mum - she pushed him away. I was left to comfort him. He'd done all he could to stop our family being evicted. He'd worked so damn hard. And it happened. My mum didn't comfort him because he was drunk. But I know he was just lost. I just comforted him. And I admit I broke down too.

We didn't have long to clear the house, so as a result a lot of our childhood memories were left behind. That last night was so surreal when we went there for the last time to leave the keys.

We moved into a place run by a dodgy landlord. It had been an illegal HMO - house of multiple occupancy - which meant it previously had a lot of families living there. They all moved out before we got there, so we were the only family living there. But the landlord was a family friend who saved us from being homeless.

It was a shithole. Cigarette butts everywhere. Chewing gum stuck to walls. A cellar still full of all their old junk. The roof leaked when it rained.

I went to the doctors and was put on anti-depressants for the first time, but they made me feel so ill I just stopped taking them.

I moved on from the call centre job. But honestly, I was so miserable at that point, that I spent way too much time drinking. I'd isolate myself in my room. My mum would joke she never saw anything of me. And it was true. I gave up trying to socialise with her when all she did was stare at her computer all night. So I just stayed alone.

Eventually my brother got a new girlfriend. He actually asked me to move in with him - in Scotland - just to see if I could settle and get a job etc. So I agreed. It was great. We'd hang out, laugh, sometimes drink a little too much, but it was good. We're good friends so it was nice to finally have some release.

After several months I got a job and enough money to make my own way. I was finally able to bring my dog up from down South to live with me. Which was awesome. Of course, things went wrong again.

I was in a job where I now realise my manager wanted rid of me but didn't have any real reason to sack me. So, he palmed me off with a store transfer, promising me more hours and a solid schedule. Of course, the manager at the other store had no idea about the full-time hours and set rota. He was furious at my old manager.

I went for a walk with my dog one night and was just so overwhelmed. I stood by a sea wall considering jumping. I was making a plan for how best to ensure my dog got to safety. He jumped up, put his front paws on the wall, and gave me a look which said: ""Don't you dare, human"". I sat down on a bench and cried into his neck-fluff.

I quit and got a job at the same shop my brother worked at (Same company but different location), but when they sacked my brother over bogus claims I too eventually quit (I got on well with the people, but it felt wrong working under someone who had sacked my brother over something that was BS). And anyway. I wanted a better paying job.

My niece was born. I drove my sister-in-law to the hospital while she was in labour. But this was at the start of the first lockdown - I was unable to see her properly. It felt like I was so involved and then suddenly very isolated as I was unable to visit my brother. Unable to see my niece. I had no friends. No other family. No-one but my dog.

I ended up being completely useless at the new job and got sacked. I was unemployed for about 3 months and living off benefits. I hit rock-bottom. I spent too much drinking. I slept for days at a time without eating. I even went on a random 1am walk with my dog for about 8 miles and came home with bloodied, blistered feet. I spent Christmas not even being able to buy a first present for my niece. I felt like a useless aunt.

I eventually got another job in a factory working at an agency, and my hours got cut down to just 2 days a week which wasn't enough to pay rent. I was stressed out

I got a new job, which is where I am now. It's a factory again. My co-workers are toxic. The work is repetitive. Every day feels like same.

I got signed off work for two weeks. Diagnosed with anxiety along with depression. Put on new medication.

letsgetitstartedinha,depression,1620630996.0,What do you do when your usual coping mechanisms stop working?,"TW: eating disorders

I was feeling happy for so long, but  I'd occasionally get anxiety because being happy for a long period of time seems suspicious after so many years of going through depression. Pretty much just always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I know it's a barrier so it won't be as devastating after the next bad thing happens so you can always be prepared. I finally, **FINALLY** talked myself out of it at one point to where I stopped always waiting for something terrible to happen and just let it all go and have a more positive outlook. 

Then, of course, not too long after I was *extremely* caught off guard by my bestfriend/ ex saying something my previous ex would always say which is saying that they regret meeting me and wouldn't have wasted their time if they knew about my past early on. It's made me think back to every fight, disagreement, or difficult time that I had with them and it won't stop replaying in my head.

I keep going back and forth between anger and sadness. Anger at people begging me to open up to them just so they can judge me for it and also angry at myself for being vulnerable. 

Ive struggled with bulimia on and off since 2009 when I was in highschool. I haven't binged and purged in 3 ½ years now, but I'm really struggling with trying not to start again. I have GERD from doing it for so long so I've taken medication for it every day since 2018. For the past week, I really haven't eaten much and I have had the worst heartburn so I feel like my body is subconsciously telling me not to b/p because, if I do, it'll make it 100x worse. My heart is hurting in both the physical and emotional sense. I've avoided eating all day because I feel like I am just going to relapse if I do. For those who don't know, bulimia has a lot to do with control issues.

Ive cried more times in the past few weeks than I have in probably the last year. It has been so long since I've felt like this and my usual coping mechanisms are not helping and I can't make the thoughts or the crying stop. My insomnia is back because of it.

abb3yr0ad,depression,1620577531.0,Just venting,"I (25F) don’t want to resent my (18F) sister but I just keep messing up with her. I want to get out of this negative mindset and documenting my thoughts somehow may help. I can’t let her words get to me. I’m just so exhausted. So exhausted of the mental gymnastics I have to do with her. She says that I’m a terrible bitch and don’t deserve anything good in this life. I know words are just words but I feel like she’s starting to believe it. I don’t want to go on living like this. 

I don’t want to resent my parents but they’re checked out with taking care of her. So now I have to be the sister AND the parent. I can’t ever just be the sister because if I was, I’d probably be a better support system. Over time, it’s become hard for me to empathize with her because I always feel like I am on the other side of the situation, rather than on her side. Lately it’s been hard for us to get along because I always seem to infuriate her over something small. She says that I’m basically overthinking the wrong things - that if I had just done this or that, etc. everything would’ve been fine or she wouldn’t be as mad. My parents created this person. They enabled these behaviors and now I have to bear the brunt of it. I don’t want to feel any more sorry for myself than I already do because it’ll just make me spiral and I’ll keep thinking negatively. She always says not to focus on her insults but instead use it as motivation to change, but she doesn’t understand my depression. My depression seemingly now has been a huge burden on everyone because they’re just waiting on me to change. I’m tired. I’m mentally and physically exhausted. 

My aunt gave me a way out which is to stay with her for a few days each week to keep her and my grandma company. I know this is my anxiety talking but I just know my sister will be mad that I get this reprieve and she doesn’t. More and more, I can feel how much she resents me but I have to be the one to fix the wrongs and I’m TIRED man.

Now I think about taking myself out of the equation completely but I know it’s just ideation. I need to get out of this mindset because it’s preventing me from doing the things I need to do. I know I have to take it day by day but right now I’m literally just trying to make it to the end of each day. I always thought doing that was enough but now it isn’t because everyone is waiting on me to change. 

Sorry my thoughts are everywhere, I’m pretty much just venting. I’ve never really posted my thoughts on a public platform before so if you’ve read up to here, thank you."

I remember specific times when I was 13 years old but I'm sure I knew something was wrong before then.  My family was a mess.  My father, though he lived with us was a total stranger. I don't even know what he did for a living. I honestly can't tell you why my parents wanted children.  It seemed they hated all of us. I got married at 30 to someone I didn't love because I was getting old and wanted kids. I had three children and I thought though I knew I wasn't happy, at least I was content. I talked to people but they were mostly parents of my kids and my husband's friends. It all caught up with me at about 40. I realized I was unhappy and didn't love my husband. I tried to kill myself, was locked up and that was the end of the life as I knew it. I lost all my friends, my husband, and my children think of me as an embarrassment. My therapist dropped me and I never could trust another person. The truth is, I really don't care. I don't understand why any of us want to live in this world anyway. I sometimes think everyone else who ISN'T depressed is just deluding themselves anyway. With all the suffering and hate that goes around, why on earth would anyone want to live? Yes, I know.  I must have some hope.  I'm writing this right? I don't know. It's either this or lose my mind.  But what kind of life is this, anyway?

I don’t mean pleasure in a moment here or a moment there. Those moments are attainable, but real existential happiness is not. My issues run deep, to early early childhood. I’ve never known anything but this. And now I have been diagnosed with borderline. It’s just unrealistic to think that I can ever be free of these things. That’s not how life works. The issues that you face don’t just magically disappear, they must be solved, and with mental health, YOU are the only one who can solve them. I’ve tried, for over a decade and a half now to solve them, and it just hasn’t happened. 

I can’t throw in the towel and just kill myself though. That would not be fair to my mom and dad. They really really love me, and I owe it to them to at least live. So I am stuck living a life that I can never be happy in. What do I do? Well, there are still people who I care about, so what if I work for their happiness? My goose is cooked. Theirs is not. There are things that I can help them with and battles that I can help them fight. Will this bring me real happiness? No, not really.

I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and had reached a teetering point.  Without unpacking to much, I've been terrible at making decisions for myself often just being pushed into a choice or indecision takes the opportunity away.  I have gotten most of an associate's horticulture and spent the last 5 years being a yesman and working my way up to be terminated last June for ""covid"" reasons.  I'm doing everything I can think of to find employment with equal or greater pay outside landscaping.  
6 months before that I had to leave the home I was staying in so the landlords kid and grandkids had a place to stay, I don't blame them I would have done the same thing for my kid. Now me ,my SO and child live in the basement of a family members house and they have been a blessing.

I have a family that I want to take care of and a special needs child that has made tremendous improvements since I lost my job.  I've been hyper focused on them and have developed a love for being a homemaker of sorts.  This only adds to my avoidance of gainful employment.
My head begins to physically hurt when I try to sort my thoughts.  Another huge issue I have is that we are above poverty from an income stand point however life happens and my debt to income ratio for the last ten years has made it impossible for me to get ahead. Often times having to put off a bill to pay a more important one or even buy groceries.  

I'm lost and can't see a direction that will pull me out of my hurdles.  I don't know how to bring in money while working with my childs development and my own roadblocks.

 Another moment to think thoughts for myself.
 Fatigue kills, and confusion is here.  But I'm in my bed thinking.

 And I knew how to think, decipher and understand.  But today and now it's like a heavy fog with no horizon.  It's hard for me to see beyond, it's hard for me to think deeply.  I feel superficial.

 It's like a sea of ​​information with surging waves, and she comes closer and understands and the love grows.  But I am in confusion, from a moment of fear to love.  And I sink into thought.

 Hot here, feeling dry, as if like such smoke blocking the field of vision.  It's hard to live here, well, I know that.  But the main thing is at least I type my thoughts?

 But I'm not in focus, diligence ceases, I feel dead slowly and the direction runs out.  I was flooded with a sea of ​​information, which everyone accepts.  But my muscles have stopped working.

 I was inundated with advertisements, varied opinions, and the bundled troubles that await in every corner.  And it's hard here to understand, it's hard to absorb at all, there's no reason in the world to think, and no less.

 I feel emptiness, but such real, empty of purpose but like something narrow, like empty music, like out-of-love love, and like environmental loneliness.

 My self is extinct, and it feels lost to me.  How can I live in such a miserable world.  My inner self dominated, it was always there, hobby, after hobby.  And here I am lying alone like a liquid on floors, a small mistake of something that was broken into pieces.  And without displacement.

 I knew, but I'm tired of knowing again.  My mind thought, and thoughts like nothing.

 Now it remains to be calm, rested and rested, to pass another day that comes suddenly, and to live in an obscure reality.  And the main thing is to understand or learn, the factory will continue to work.
 I will live in it.  I will study it, and the main thing is to finish.

I wanted to work in the animation industry or the cinema, burned myself really bad; (Working from 8am to 8am of the next day with 24h sleep in between) so now I have to learn how to appreciate what I dedicated my life to again.

Absolutely love space, stupid as a wall when it comes to math.

It may sound absolutely dramatic since I’m only 20, but everything moves SO FAST and I can’t keep up. I see people going forward in life, being happy in their craft, being hella talented, and I’ve just been a depressed fuck for the last 10 years. 
A year ago I was still considered/treated like a child, and now I have to make decisions that are out of my reach. Do I find a random job for food money and closet appartement ? Do I pursue in art/cinema, but then what if I burn myself again and for good ? Couldn’t live with that. What if I’m not good enough ? (I’m not) Should I start over in an other country ? Should I go back in school ? (I emotionally and financially can’t) I could marry rich but you gotta be good looking for that lol. 

I hardly have any energy to get out of bed, even less to get any work done. (I have 2 short films to yet work on) 

Masking is EXHAUSTING.
Just feel really useless. 

I just feel like I already blew all my chances of a comfortable future lol
When I see young people being able to buy their parents their dream cars/house/trips it makes me really sad because I know I probably will never be able to. 

If it was for me, I’d have no business being still alive, I don’t see the point of a lifetime of labour tbh. 


I want them to be proud,but there’s nothing for them to be. And it breaks my heart for them because they are the absolute best, they supported me through EVERYTHING and they deserve better. 

I don’t know what to do."

nonbinarynobody420,depression,1620521005.0,I'm really lonely.,"I just moved to a new city where I have no friends and know barely anyone. In March the love of my life broke up with me and I fell apart. I tried to kill myself and spent 10 days in a psych ward. I still miss them.

I didn't think I'd magically be happy by moving out here. But I thought some combination of changing the material circumstances of my life might help. I've been trying to take good care of myself. I'm going for long walks every single day. I'm taking my antidepressants and mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications. I'm eating good food. I have a new, well-paying job. I'm trying to stay in touch with the few friends I have back in my ""old home."" I'm still really sad.

Obviously we're still in the middle of a pandemic and it's not an ideal time to make such a significant life change. But I'm having trouble even connecting with people on dating apps. I don't think I'm extremely unattractive. But I'm finding that there aren't as many people like me in this city as I thought there would be. And I still miss my ex so fucking much. I loved them. I still love them. We talked about moving here together. I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with them.

I really want to be happy. But I hate myself so much. I want to be proud of myself for surviving and trying and ""learning"" and ""growing."" I don't know.

Saile_858,depression,1620623596.0,I feel like I'm at the top bottom of my life and don't have no one to ask for help,"I finally reached my limit. My life is a total failiure and not even my family knows or cares about it. 

I grew up in something that started like a normal 4-people family but rapidly turned into a mess. When I was 15-yo my mom was diagnosed with stage IV medular cancer, six months later she passed away. Instantly after my mom's dead, everything was going to fuck from bad to worse. 

My father has always been very strict non-talkative dad, there's no dad jokes, there's no dad-son moments since I was 16, a few months after my mom's funeral. My relationship with my dad was never close, but it grew up on distance even more trough the years. Nowadays we barely salute each other.

My mom died in Jan-2013, 8 years ago. Since that moment I had to learn everything about life quickly and alone. Despite my dad didn't abandon me, his figure has been quite absent in my path trough life, like I said before. As a mid-teenager I had to learn alone about cooking, cleanning, house shopping and personal finance, all along my studies and university admissions results ahead.

I feel I did well those first months, I made up a seat for study electrical engineering on college, later found my first gf and made a new life going to church. But 2 years later, in 2015, everything fucked up again. I had to drop college for 2 semesters, lost my first gf, lost all my friends, no money, disfunctional family. My motivation for life was starting to fall. During the 2 semesters I was out from college, I tried to find some certifications in terms of looking for a good revenue job like CCNA or AutoCAD. I was able to finish CCNA but I couldn't afford certification exam at the moment. I didn't care much about it because I was starting uni a few weeks later.

In 2016 I started uni for second time. I was still studying EE and had to retake some subjects to catch up my pensum. I feel like I was doing great, those 2 semesters I was able to recover and find love for what I was studying. Later, in 2017 I met my 2nd gf and instantly my life was taking it's first steps for a second more-deeper sinking.

My dad never agreed with my choices, but never gave me wisdom either at least. We always had fights  for everyting I made or didn't made and rapidly had to become used to be called 'a total failiure' by him. But in the other hand he is totaly pleasant and lacks of discipline with my sister, wich is 2 years younger than me. When I started my second relationship while I was on my 20's, my fights with my dad turned less frequent because my gf's family were friends of him from church when they were teens. I thought this would be helpful but the more the time passed, the more that dream became a nightmare.

2017 and 2018 were the most detestable years of my life. 2017 is caracterized by all the shitty political situation that hit harder Venezuela in that year due the fall of oil prices, and 2018 is remembered by me for all the humilliations that I recieved from the shitty people of my ex gf family. I was failling on college, had no money, had little or no food at all, problems with my dad, problems with my gf and her family, suffered from bully made by her parents (they were used to tell me that my dad was right calling me a failiure, even were used to compare me with other son-on-law of them). I was willing to die. Meanwhile, my gf's parents recover touch with a friend of theirs who knew my dad by those same years. She was a 50yo divorced woman who was close to them and quickly added to the group. In december of 2018 she and my dad maried making everything worse.

In May 2019 I found my first job. It wasn't my dream job but was a dreamed-first-job. I started as an junior consultant on a little IT company, was a half-time schedule that allowed me to take some college subjets on mornings and going to office on noons. Payment wasn't glory but was a gamechanger for me. I was very happy and thanking God for such an opportunity despite was something that I don't like at all wich is programming but, as is known, 'beggars can't be choosers'. No one agreed nor celebrated me. My dad said that I should had focused more on college, my gf and her family said that it would be problematic since I was reducing the time I spent with their daugther and many other shit. A few months later my dad and his wife decided to move appart, leaving me and my sister living by ourselves. That didn't surprised me, and I tried to take it as a booster. A couple months later, my gf and I broke up... Sincerely was the most painful relationship in my life. I was submited into sadness because I was all alone, felt like was totally abandoned. I was failling at uni, living with a disfunctional family, leaving a painful toxic long term relationship, with no friends and very little money.

I tried to overcome the end of that relationship trying to focus even more on college, working harder and looking for met some new people. It worked for about 4 months until coivd hit and pandemic started. Instantly everything went down, I stopped college (again but this time wasn't my fault and this feels the most frustrating), I stopped meeting new people (since everyone new I met was in college and church, this is a correlated from last one), I lost all contact with the few acquaintances I had (my terrible social skills and lack of close friends along my grow made me take the wrong decision of doing a social shutdown and stoped talking with some people I was used to), work became heavier from home and all my stress and frustration doesn't motivate me at all. I'm willing to quit but I don't wanna do it yet. I became lazier because I don't left home as I was used to, before pandemics I walked about 10 km by day because I liked to walk from college to work and after from work to home. 

Now, I'm here feeling like a total failiure. I'm 24 and I'm thinking about drop shcool but this time definetely and changing for a totally new career like economics, I'm about to quit my job because I don't like it at all, I dropped church, social media, hobbies, meaning of life, I dropped every effort of doing something life-valuable. I stopped enjoying life so much long ago that I dream with a new fresh start. I'm scared. I'm totally unmotivated. I'm frustrated with me, with my life, with my freacking hell-maker bad choices looking how the people that graduated with me from high school is now living their lifes while I'm here being miserable because of my own fault. I wish I had seen all the red flags trough my life.

I wrote all this because I needed to steam off. I know this won't finish my missery but I have no one else to tell how I feel. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to quit my job, I'm scared of how they can react. I'm scared of making another terrible choice... I have finally collapsed"

GeekyReindeer,depression,1620507707.0,Do Professional Therapists use any scheduling service/app to make appointments with clients/patients?,"Hello everyone, I'm new here so please be gentle :)

I want to make a SAAS app for  mental health professionals to help them schedule sessions/appointments with patients/clients. It would have the following features :

1. Easy of use, Simple Cloud-based booking/scheduling of time-slots
2. Automatic Zoom/Google Meet link generation (will be sent to both client and doctor)
3. Automatic Reminders to both client and doctor
4. Ability for the client to reschedule by choosing open slot from the doctor's timetable without discussing with doctor
5. A little AI that will help predict when slots might be open, and notify you to try and fill them

The pain-point I'm trying to address and possibly solve is that a lot of time goes wasted in deciding a time, setting up the meeting and sending the link across. All of these could be easily automated.

Would professionals be willing to use a service like this? (Say for 10$ a month?)

Do you already use a service like this? Can you point me in the right direction?

Thanks for your help!"
These-Yogurtcloset85,depression,1620479450.0,Entrepreneur boyfriend (29M) who I suspect is chronically depressed thinks he wants to break up with me (29F) after 4 years - is it just the depression talking or do I let him go?,"I know this is an extremely long read but I would really appreciate any advice fellow people with experience dating depressed entrepreneurs might have.

My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 4 years, of which the last 1.5 years has been on and off long distance (I went away to grad school). The first 3 years of our relationship was amazing, happy, and healthy. One thing that always loomed over our relationship though was that my boyfriend was just starting a business and he was struggling immensely with the burden, pressure, and slow success of it. I was a big support system for him during this struggle but he would get so depressed at times that he would admit to having contemplated suicide. It was very difficult to support him during this time and I eventually convinced him to speak to someone routinely, although he ended up going with a life coach rather than a therapist.

After I left to grad school 1.5 years ago, and things were fine for the first 6 months or so but I could tell some resentment was building because - even though he was incredibly supportive about my decision to go - my boyfriend felt abandoned and alone and was going through the same daily grind every day. We were still in the same time zone though and talked every day and I still did my utmost to support him and we were luckily still about to see each other every 6-8 weeks for the first 9 months or so. When COVID hit though, I ended up moving back with him for 6 months. This is when I think things began to be more strained because the built up resentment and fear of abandonment had started to create walls between us. I could tell things were not the same between us anymore - he was fearful of the future, he lashed out and was more irritable, nothing excited him anymore, it was a struggle to ever get him to do anything fun or adventurous, he never took initiative, and he became more self-centred. I attributed it to his depression and tried to be available to support him but the change in his behaviour towards me was hurtful and so we also fought more than we used to, and not as well as we used to. Although in the past I used to be able to help him through his depression, he started to stonewall me more now. We had a few conversations about our struggles but nothing that really translated into a change in behaviour. During one of these conversations, he explicitly expressed that he was feeling pressure and not ready for marriage or kids which I had said I was okay with (and was and still am). We spent 6 months in this somewhat rocky situation but I left again when we were on good terms.

My second year of grad school was in London and I moved there September 2020. The time difference between London and back home is 5 hours which made it more difficult to have substantial conversations this time around while I was gone. Despite not being in the best place in our relationship, my boyfriend adamantly insisted I go to London (London is my favourite city and it had been a dream of mine to live there). During my first semester as I spent more time in London, I started to really fall in love with living there and was very openly conflicted with my boyfriend about it because - despite having conversations about the possibility- when it came down to it, he was not willing to move there himself. My dilemma was that I would lose my right to live there in the future if I moved back (I needed to stay in the country for 5 years to get a PR) and so I oscillated on staying there or moving back many times. The conversations were very hard on my boyfriend but I didn't really realize this in the moment because I think if I'm being honest, I really wanted him to change his mind and move out there with me but he just wasn't able to handle the prospect of such a big change. The conversations culminated in my boyfriend initiating a break with me for a few days to think things through because he was really hurt by my indecision. This was extremely painful for me because up until then, I had always felt that he was the one reliable and trustworthy person in my life. It really made us both reflect on the relationship and made me realize where my priorities were/are.

He reached out to me to end the ""break"" after 4 days. We had a long conversation about what had happened - he was very afraid that I would be unsatisfied in life and was worried about me moving back home without actually wanting to and resenting him for it. At this point though, I had worked through a lot of things independently and realized I was using London as an exit plan because I was scared about the walls that had built up in our relationship. In the end, I decided it was more important for me to make our relationship work than to stay in London and so I had resolved to move back home once I finished the program.

When I was home over Christmas break, we did MDMA together to try to heal our relationship. We also had many emotional discussions/fights about whether or not we should end our relationship based on how difficult things had been. Each time, we decided what we had was worth fighting for. During this period, my boyfriend had a bit of a mental breakdown and started suffering from intense anxiety. As I mentioned, he's prone to depression but he started to attribute these panic attacks to our relationship even though they were obviously about so much more than that (COVID, a lack of fulfillment and sense of purpose or accomplishment with his startup despite putting his entire soul and identity into it, etc.) which has been very damaging. We talked about it many times and he would agree he was being unfair by attributing his anxiety to our relationship (even his mom had to tell him this) but I believe he would always default back to it as a scapegoat rather than confront the truth about his unhappiness. My time home ended up extending to 3 months because COVID was very bad in London at the time but I finally flew back to London in March 2021. The night before I flew back, we had a very emotional discussion that felt like a breakthrough to tearing down the walls. My boyfriend mentioned how he did not feel the magic anymore and he wanted it back so desperately and we vowed to take time to work on things independently and ""build back better"" once we were reunited.

Flash forward to now, I've been in London for 2 months and things have deteriorated over the past week. I was anxious and miserable basically from the moment I arrived - likely out of fear for what would happen to our relationship- but it manifested in different physical conditions that got so bad it drove me to the ER one night. I more or less have stopped sleeping. Within a few weeks of me arriving back in London, it felt like the walls between my boyfriend and I were back up which I believe triggered my intense anxiety. My boyfriend and I had kept up consistent conversation but it's been difficult to have meaningful conversations with the time difference. He was pretty supportive during these 2 months and although maybe not as loving as he had been in the past (which I still attributed to his fear that I was going to choose London over him and general depression), still very available and attentive. Something changed this past week though, kind of out of the blue.

My boyfriend is prone to apathy but this past week, I especially noticed he was pulling back. Finally a few days ago, I confronted him about it and asked if he wanted to break up. He admitted he didn't feel the magic anymore and wasn't excited about a future with me and that worried him and he wasn't sure if he wanted to break up. He said it 'didn't feel right anymore in his soul' and that he'd been 'fighting' it for a long time because he didn't want to believe it. He also said he still loved and cared about me very much but felt indifference towards me sometimes. I asked him if he felt he would regret breaking up with me and he said he thought there was a high probability that he would, but a higher probability that he wouldn't. Obviously all of this was shattering to me. We had made plans for the future together, we had agreed to stick it out through thick and thin because what we shared was so rare and neither of us had ever felt anything close to it before. I could not believe the words that were coming from his mouth. It didn't feel real. It didn't feel possible for him to be saying those things to me, especially over the phone only 2 months after we had agreed to take time to ourselves and try again when we were reunited. I did put him on the spot that night though by confronting him about whether he wanted to break up and he did say he was feeling those things in the moment but still wasn't sure how he really felt or if the feelings would endure. He said he regretted having the conversation over the phone and only did so because I asked and he said I deserved to be told the truth but that he didn't know whether those feelings would stick and needed more time to think and sort through everything.

Somehow throughout the conversation, I remained extremely calm but he alternated between crying and apologizing. I could tell he was genuinely very conflicted. It turns out, he had another panic attack/nightmare earlier this week and although there were no triggers from our relationship standpoint, somehow he still thought it had to do with our relationship because he had been ""thinking about it"" around that time. I spoke to his mom at length about it afterwards (they are very close and he tells her everything and she reached out to make sure I was okay afterwards) and she thought it was ridiculous that he would blame our relationship for his anxiety when his anxieties were far more complex than that. He's also had an especially rough few weeks with investors losing faith in him and pulling out $100K from the business, feeling extremely unexcited about startup and what he did on the day-to-day, having an employee he had high hopes for randomly quit and ghost him, and having the place where he lives enter a really restrictive COVID lockdown.

I still love my boyfriend very much although I agree the past year with COVID and long distance have been immensely stressful and difficult and we have lost the ""magic"", but to be totally fair, we hadn't really worked on things too much. We basically kept telling each other this struggle was temporary and we would be able to go back to normal once we were together again but now as the time for us to reunite is nearing (I was going to move back in July), it seems like he's giving up before we reach the finish line. I do think that once we are back to living together and the fear of abandonment is gone though, that we can gain the magic of our relationship back. We just allowed too many walls to build to protect ourselves from the uncertainty and insecurities that sprung up during long distance. 

I'm also concerned that my boyfriend is depressed and is blaming our relationship for his pain because he's feeling both overwhelmed and underwhelmed with life. I have spoken to his mom extensively about it and she says that she believes he does still really love me but he's very confused and doesn't know what he wants. She agrees that he's likely depressed and needs help and is unfairly blaming our relationship because it's easier than confronting the root causes of his unhappiness. What I'm wondering is whether to let him go or fight for our relationship? Is there any coming back from all the things he said to me? Has anyone else dealing with an entrepreneur boyfriend with depression had something similar happen? 

We have worked SO hard to stick it out and it just feels like he's in a bad place and thinks not having the responsibility of a relationship will make things better. Obviously the long distance doesn't help either as I think it has enabling him to disassociate from me. I don't think he would have came to the same conclusions if we were not long distance and we were having this conversation in person. How do I make him see this though? Right now, we're on a bit of a break while he sorts out his feelings and I'm not sure what to do from here. If he decides he wants to end things, do I fly out to see him and fight for what we have, or do I let him go? I genuinely don't believe we will find what we had with anyone else - we have said this to each other many times - and I'm not sure we gave ourselves a fighting chance by ending things right when they were about to get better (from a distance standpoint).

Adding to all this stress is that I'm now in the middle of job interviews for jobs back home. He's feeling this pressure because he's worried I'm only moving back for him (which is only partially true as I am actually very excited about some of the jobs I'm interviewing for) and keeps saying he's trying to ""force himself"" to make a decision or feel what he used to. He says he still loves me very much and I'm trying to figure out if he's just suffering through a bad bout of depression and feeling numb to everything. His life coach also told him that losing the magic in a relationship is a bad sign which didn't help the situation but from everything I've read online, it's totally normal to happen without putting effort into getting it back and especially if someone is depressed. Am I missing something?

Any advice from others who have experienced this would be so, so appreciated!   


Tl;dr - Depressed entrepreneur boyfriend of 4 years (the last 1.5 of which has been on and off long distance) has been struggling immensely with his mental health but rather than walking away from the startup that is killing him, he's shifted the blame to our relationship and believes he wants to end things"

Looking at me, no one would ever know

I am the free spirited child. The ray of sunshine. 
I am the loving girlfriend. The friendly coworker.
I am always consistent. I am always there. 

Part of me wishes I wasn’t. It’s growing. 

I’m steady. I am crumbling inside. 

I smile and nod. I am screaming at someone to see. 
Just once. 

I sing Maggie Rogers while driving. I imagine wrapping the car around a tree. 

Would they ever see it coming? I am invisible. 

 Even writing this, I feel the need to sound right. The “right” kind of suicidal. Fucked? Yeah, I know. 

I think about dying so I don’t have to perform for everyone anymore and here I am. 

Still performing. 

Still hoping that if I can just get it right. If I can just be a better friend. A better child. A better girlfriend. Coworker. Better everything. A better me. 

They will love me. And they will see me for who I am. 

Maybe one day, someone will see.

Then I became one. I’m exhausted."

melnwater,depression,1620573045.0,I regret not seeking help before.,"I'm a 21(F) and I've always kept to myself so I don't know where to start or if I'm rambling too much. 

I grew up with pretty strict parents. Whenever I cried in front of them they got annoyed with me and told me that they were going through worse things, so I felt so ashamed and guilty when I cried. I still feel guilty being sad because I know there are people who have it way worse than me. In middle school my parents pushed me to get perfect grades and my friends were smart and mean and I felt so dumb. I wasn't allowed to hang out afterschool or stroll around town, and I felt like I didn't have a real friend that I could talk to. I felt lonely, and I was sad when my mom yelled at me for ""doing nothing"" and never making friends. I found it hard to make too many friends as I had to come home straight after school, but I hated myself for that anyways. My dad would always remind me how much money he was spending on me. He expects me to live based on his happiness because without him, I wouldn't be alive on this Earth right now. I never asked to be born lol. On top of that my dad would drink most times of the week and force me to be with him while he drank, which really drained me. His drunkenness would come with toxicity and sometimes he would say some mean things I wish I never heard. It was no surprise he would hit us more often when he was drunk because he would hit us even when sober. I couldn't say anything I wanted to say and I told him ""I love you"" whenever I was scared. I was so scared, and I hated myself for that.

When I went to the doctor during this time she asked me several questions and she seemed concerned and told me she thought I was showing signs of depression. I was scared because my mom was in the room with me and I was all teary-eyed because the doctor seemed like she really cared about what I thought, and I wasn't used to that. On the ride home my mom told me that it made no sense that I may be depressed and she was clearly upset at me. She told me she was doing so much for me and I had no right to be feeling like this. I told her that the doctor thought wrong and that I was perfectly fine, and immediately my mom stopped being mad. I hated it when she was upset with me. All I ever wanted was to make her proud. So I started living as if nothing was wrong, through years of constant anxiety attacks and isolating myself whenever I felt anything other than happiness. I had thoughts of ending my life but brushed them off as just random thoughts.

Now I'm an adult proud to have made it without any help, fighting my own demons thinking I have succeeded, only to realize it keeps coming back, and it hits back worse. Everyday as an adult I tell myself how worthless and ugly I am. I'm still living under my parents' roof and I feel like such a burden. I can't move out at the moment. Sometimes I think about how much better off they would be financially if I just disappeared from their life. I feel like everyone is just better off without my presence, and that feeling of uselessness always comes back to me. I just wish I went to therapy or something during middle or high school, but I always told myself that how I felt was normal and that there were people who have it far worse than me. I regret this and feel like it's too late for me, even though deep down I know that's not true. At this point it feels like I hate myself so much that I'm just punishing myself by not seeking any help. I feel so lonely and wish I could tell someone everything, but I am scared they'll see me as crazy or dramatic. I just want to stop feeling so lonely and useless and get up and fix myself, but I have no motivation for that anymore. I just want to make people I care about proud and happy, but I feel like I do the opposite of that so what's the point."
MarMarL2k19,depression,1620577887.0,I hate myself,"Today I woke up. I had breakfast. I had sweet dreams. I burshed ny teeth. Just my normal life. But then I remembered something me and my girlfriend talked about yesterday. That she will be apart of a dnd group every friday. I was a little hurt by it that she didn't at least talk about it with me. Anyway, as I was thinking about it, I realized something. I cling to people. I obsess over those who show me love and compassion. And I loathe myself for it. I loathe the fact that I rely on other people so much. I do activities like go on walks, runs, push-ups just to get my mind on myself. But then I find myself obsessing over the fact that things will never be like I want them to be. I hate the fact that people show me love but over time they cease to show that love.

I can't be happy for others if it doesn't benefit me. I'm selfish. For example, sometimes I play league with the boys, but when they go off because they ""don't feel like playing"" I feel empty. I feel empty once they leave the call. I feel so alone. And the same with my girlfriend.

The reason I am like this is because when ai was young, no one wanted to befriend me. Everyone I met bullied me. From kindergarden, to elementary... All the way up to 7th grade. I was pushed, insulted, told I was an inconcenience and an accident. Due to that, the people I met nowadays that show me love and compassion... I cling to them. I want to protect those people from harm and help them just like they help me.

And I loathe myself for it. I really have to seek out a therapist. I hate myself for everything I am..."

psyberfae,depression,1620621100.0,being depressed is causing me to neglect my pets emotionally.,"I have 2 kitties I love with all my heart and soul, they mean the world to me. I've been dealing with some pretty heavy depression these past 2-3 months. I've been isolating myself as much as I can, including from my loving pets. Of course I care for them still, clean up their litter, feed them, make sure they have clean water, try to give them both attention as much as I can every day. Sometimes they seem extra needy though and I really feel depleted emotionally and just want to curl up and be left alone, I feel so bad."
Yumepon,depression,1620615238.0,Narcissistic mother,"This is all things from the past(around 5-10 years ago), but I want to vent. Please give me a comment if you thought my mother was toxic or narcissistic, for I’m still not sure of it. 

I got into a veterinary school at 18, after a full year of doing nothing but studying, eating and sleeping. 
Mother resented this however, because she didn’t want her daughter to be better than her. Also she hated the fact her money(raised solely by father because she’s a housewife) was being taken away for my relatively high school costs. She became depressed and eventually threatened to kill herself if I kept going to school. At just 18 mother was everything to me, and I was in such a shock I couldn’t concentrate on my studies-every minute of every day the only thing I could think of was my mother lying dead at home-my grades fell and I dropped out of school. Apparently I too was depressed to the point I couldn’t think logically or reach out for help. Unfortunately father was a very cold hearted if not psychopathic and emotionally unavailable, he pretended as if mother’s depression did not exist and I was an ungrateful brat for quitting school. 

After quitting school I lost all purpose in life and a few years later attempted suicide. 
By then mother had found a new lover and filed a divorce to marry him. I moved in with her to his home and his children because i was still very dependent on her despite what she had done to me. 

I was hospitalized for attempted suicide and discharged three months later. I was returned home to my mother. The things she said to me there went something like : you’re a retard, you’re an embarrassment to the family, please don’t show yourself in front of my husband or his children, you’ll leave a bad impression for me. 

I was given a storage room to live in. The door had no lock, it was too small to even spread a mattress flat, and everyday and night I could hear mother and her husband having sex across the hallway in their bedroom. During those times I slept with a belt firmly grasped in my hand, and during daytime I would walk around the neighborhood counting the floors of apartments, finding peace whenever I came across accessible buildings that were tall enough for me to end my life whenever I wished. 

Sorry this is so long. I have a lot more to tell in between but I’ll keep it like this for now. Btw, for those who care to know, I’ve escaped both my parents five years ago, still dealing with heavy depression but I live away from those toxic people. Thank you for those who took their time to read this!"

Ta-veren-,depression,1620541503.0,Finally got a job but realized all I am worth in this world.,"I have always struggled with who I am, what I would be good at, what I should do for a job. To an extent that I avoided the question successfully for so long.  I finally lined up my first job and I was excited, I am way behind on the job front for my age and where I should be in life. That knowledge alone is pretty scary but I managed to land my first job, was kind of pumped and thrilled at the idea of earning money and being useful in some way.

Now, my dad meant it in a nice way, he really didn't understand the weight of his words or the way he said them but they depressed me to no end. ""Over the years I made a list of jobs I thought you'd be good at and ones you wouldn't be and the wouldn't be list had so much in it but this job I think you'll be really good at and I'm proud of you"" 

I don't know, the fact this is just your run of a mill, probably could have a robot doing it made me super depressed like that's all I am worth? Just a basic grunt? It's who I am and who I will probably be all my life and that's depressing.

No offense to other grunt workers but man it's got me. The only thing I have is the fact I did get to do great things and see wonders in my younger years but it's hard to look at my own future with any happiness. I'm hoping this will open doors to me and I will keep looking for others in hopes to find something I won't mind doing. I'm hoping I might finally get the answer to the question of what on earth I am supposed to do. 

Has anyone else struggled with what they want to do? How did you find your place? Sadly, my passions in life wouldn't create any careers for me."
zeron6789,depression,1620481013.0,The smallest things,"I know this sounds ridiculous and honestly i wasn't even expecting it today. But I was taking care of a wounded baby bird that fell out of his nest earlier this past week. (usually one per year) but they usually are able to fly off or fend for themselves after a day or two so i end up doing only minimal helping. (mainly just putting them in a box during the night time for safety) well. He died this morning. I had the suspicion that he was getting small amounts of food and i had the opportunity to go get meal worms at least yesterday but was too depressed and lazy to do so. (again i was trying to not involve myself too often so that i don't scare his parents and such which i have seen them nearby, along with his other siblings.) i decided that today as soon as the stores opened i would go and buy some and feed him, but that didn't happen. I know its just not normal, but immediately sunk back into that depression. That failure of not even being able to help another living creature due to my lack of drive to do anything. i just want to sleep and never wake up. and i can put on a façade of getting better but this idk. Maybe I'm just tired as i haven't been sleeping well, or perhaps I'm actually jealous and envious of the baby bird. Either way. just needed to vent this out.. I feel like if i could trade my life for a baby bird to have a chance at living i absolutely would. And it sucks that we humans get to live such long lives compared to other species. Why couldn't we trade, or just choose to end it all and a full proof way of doing it?"
retrostarlet,depression,1620595122.0,I can’t get out of bed,"I don’t know where to post this or what I want. Like, I want help but I don’t think anything anyone can say will help. I’ve struggled with MDD and GAD for years and it’s only gotten progressively worse with time. I’ve spent every single day for almost a year just laying in bed scrolling through my phone on Reddit and TikTok. There’s times that I’ve tried to force myself to go for walks or hangout with friends but it takes all of my energy and I’m always miserable. Those times are only like 10% of my time, the remaining 90% is spent in my bedroom on my phone. I have literally no desire to do anything else. I’ve read comments on similar posts where people say that you will get sick of doing nothing eventually but it’s been a year. I feel like I could spend eternity like this. I’ve tried so many medications for depression and they never help. I think I need a new psychiatrist because the other day when I said how hard everything is for me she said “I think that’s just being an adult.” Nevermind that my primary care doctor keeps giving me depression assessments and I get the worst score possible. I’ve gone to therapy once a week for 2 years and it’s been useless. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t afford ketamine and I don’t want to illegally buy shrooms.

pesymisticoctopus,depression,1620505859.0,"(TW: cussing, mentioning of self harm, alcoholism, violence, suicidal thoughts and slight homophobia) A post to let it all out because I have little to no people to talk to","So first of all I was never diagnosed with depression and never went to any specialist to even try to get diagnosed. I know I should but I'm scared of 1. getting sent to some sort of psych hospital and 2. my parent's reaction. I used to self harm but after my mother once saw my scars I stopped. At some point I told my mother about my feelings and suicidal tendencies. She reacted quite well and helped (well kind of) but she never took me to a psychologist and I'm pretty glad that she didn't because I'm almost certain it wouldn't help. Since then I got much better and for some time I was a completely happy and healthy teenager. But sometime ago it all went downhill again. My parents have some, well, ""issues"" to put it that way. A year ago or so I came out to them as pan and trans and I don't think they took it that well...? I mean, they didn't kick me out of the house or anything, but they were pretty weird about it ever since. I think my mother's understanding of lgbtq+ people changed for the better but not my father's. They use my preffered pronouns for most of the time and I'm really happy about it but my father still is REALLY weird about it. He thinks that I'm some kind of a punch bag for taking his anger out on when he's irritated because of the lgbtq+ folks in our country or when he's just angry at the garbage fire that are our politicians. He likes to just sit around and talk on and on about the stuff that bugs him and he gets pretty fucking angry when I dare to disagree. And about the ""issues"" - he is an alcoholic. Sometimes, when he drinks too much booze, he goes fucking insane and starts screaming at me and my mom relentlessly and he often gets violent. Today I got in a pretty heated argument with him. He accused me of holding a grudge against him because of what he did. He said that I'm living in the past and that I should already ""let go of my trauma"" and stop only seeing the bad that he did and not the good. When he finally left my room I just started crying silently because I was devastated. He is overall a pretty shitty person but to say ""just let go of your trauma""? The trauma caused BY HIM? On top of having a fucked up father I started noticing that I'm losing my friends that are one of my very few emotional outlets. When I talk to them I can forget about the sadness and disstress living in my head. And now I'm losing them. Online school doesn't help at all. At least once a day one of the teachers need to shout at us students for being lazy shits and tells us how the lockdown changed us. Yeah, no shit it changed us, go figure. And another thing about my friends - if losing half of them wasn't bad enough I see everyday how they live their best life, go out with people and overall have fun while I sit in my bedroom all day and if I do go out on a walk or smth I don't have enyone to bring but me. I'm happy for the people I know and that they are having fun in this trying times but it just hurts so fucking bad seeing other people do the things that I also want to do but can't. I'm also an introvert and a really awkward person irl so meeting new people and not making a fool out of myself is pretty damn hard. The one of few hobbys I have is gardening which is suprisingly really calming and is the one thing that still keeps me a little sane. After the whole thing with my father today I really started to think about just ending it all. It was pretty easy to figure out from his words that life without me would be just easier to him and my mother. Same with people I know. They seem so tired of me and my issues. I'm not suprised, they shouldn't have to be worried about me and my well-being on top of living their life. It's just so fucking hard having to struggle all by myself. I feel pathetic writing it all here and whining so much but i don't have anyone else to tell it to. I stay up all night because that's the only time I can finally ease up and don't have to worry about anything at all. I'm just messed up and I don't know for how long I can take it. If you read this whole long-ass post, thank you. Thank you for taking time out of your life to read it and let me feel heard."
Specific-Bug-8849,depression,1620512124.0,Just need to vent for a bit,"My mom moved to America about 4 years ago and I came here 2 years ago because I couldn't get my visa and passport until then. At first when I came here, everything was alright. But as I got to the middle of 6th grade, she started commenting on my body and saying that I was fat, ugly and how my chest looked too big for my age. I didn't really mind it at first because I thought she was joking but she kept saying it almost everyday. I became really self-concious but acted as if what she said didn't affect me. A few days ago when she started talking about how fat I looked when we were travelling in the car, and then she said oh sorry I shouldn't have said that. For the first time in 2 years she apologized to me.

I know she is working very hard as a single parent and has a lot of worries, but she yelled and screamed at me so many times, that I got to the point where I don't think excersing or anything I do would make me look better. So I didn't do anything and she yelled at me for not excersing to make me look thinner and prettier. She destroyed my self esteem and questions me why I couldn't be how I was when I first came here. I wear baggy clothes because I feel so uncomfortable and repulsed when I wear skin tight (sort of) clothes but my mom doesn't understand any of that and yells at me to wear the clothes she bought for me instead. I have to admit that I am pretty lazy and stubborn but she really didn't have to scold me 'to make me better' to the point where I wonder what's the point of me living anyway. Until now, I thought that what she did was ok since she works so hard to provide for us and has so many worries, but I can't take it anymore. I am truly grateful for what she did for me so far, and I wish I could help her, but I don't think I can just pretend that I'm alright every single day. I want to tell her but I don't want her to have any more worries than she already has. I have no idea what to do"

Will_It_Rain,depression,1620473488.0,"You make the words ""Thank you"" so difficult","When I first received news that you would soon come, I was hopeful. When you finally came and I greeted you, though ackward, though numb, I wanted to be happy, I wanted to smile and embrace you so that you felt welcomed. When we moved in together, though there were many things I had to do, though it was stressful and exhausting, I did everything thinking this was what I had to do. I knew a good life isn't easy, so as difficult as it was, I endured and pushed forward, because life would get better. That was what I had wished for. When you first came, I was grateful because I was saved from the hell hole I had to call home. Even though you'd slap me, you've never beaten me with sticks and metal rods, though my face would turn red and swell, the skin did not tear and bleed, nor were there any bruises and breaks. For all of that, I was grateful, because, you didn't hit me frequently. You'd hit me only when you were really angry. Before, I'd get beaten everyday, so this was nothing. I can understand. I was grateful that you were willing to do some of the chores and that the chores were no longer my responsibility alone. You didn't know how to cook, but that's alright because I can learn. I may have been 11, but I was tall enough and strong enough to get things done. I did everything to your liking. I filled out paperwork, made phone calls, scheduled appointments, read the mail, wrote the checks, applied for benefits, transferred schools, and many more. I practiced smiling in the mirror continuously for many years because you said I frowned too much and it was ugly. I studied hard and got all A's because you wanted to look good amongst the relatives and friends. You didn't like me leaving the house and playing with other kids so I didn't. When you were pregnant, I scheduled all of your check-ups and accompanied you to every single one. I translated for you, cared for you, did your paperwork, and I even named the baby that you gave birth to. After you gave birth, you were weak physically and emotionally, so I did everything for you. I cooked the meals, carried the baby when he cried, fed him, changed his diapers, bathed him, and taught him. He was my brother, so just like how I cared for my sister when I was 3, I took care and raised my baby brother when I was 12. I saw that you were lonely so I allowed you to treat me as your friend and confide in me, despite the fact that I also didn't have friends myself. I believe I've been a good sister and a good daughter. I tried my best and did everything so that you would give me your attention. But even though you didn't hit me much, you never held back on your words. You knew about my traumas and insecurities because I told you them, because I trusted you and thought you'd protect me. Never had I expected that you would one day use the meanest, cruelest, most hurtful words to condemn me, to coerce me, to break me. Your words that you carelessly spat out hammered upon my wounds like knives cutting into scars. You threatened to commit suicide if I ever defied you. I was 11 when you first said these words. You told me I was useless, ungrateful, and deserving of the abuse and neglect. You told me that I ruined your life, that had it not been for me, you would not have married my father, that had it not been for me, you would not have come to America, and that had it not been for me being ""needy"" and ""messed up"" in my mind, you wouldn't have to stay at home to take care of me. But honestly, who took care of who? You told me that I was cold blooded and that I didn't have a heart. You said I was selfish. You told me I was unlovable. You told me that I made it difficult for you to love me. Because I was just that unlovable. You threatened me that if I ever made you unable to love me, then no one else in this world would love me. You said all these things to me and even words much crueler than this. I was only 11 when things started with you and I had just left a place of physical, mental, and emotional abuse, as well as neglect. I was vulnerable and you knew that. You knew. You knew how I'd get beaten everyday regardless of blame or reason. You knew I was condemned, hated, ostracized, bullied, and neglected. Sometimes I would be starved and sometimes I would be forced to eat more than my fill of cold leftovers. When I was hungry, I have even eaten grass and weeds out of hunger. And when I was forced to eat more than my fill, I had to self-indulge myself to throw up halfway with the excuse to use the restroom before continuing and ultimately finishing the food, and yet it would still be too much, but its not like I can ask for the restroom twice in one sitting. All the while, they would hit me and scold me for eating too slowly. You knew that I was abused and that I didn't have proper clothes to wear and didn't even have a proper bed or blankets. You knew that even my dad left me to fend for myself. You knew everything, you knew how young and ""messed up"" I was. You said you loved me. You told me you would protect me. You told me I could trust you. You are my mother. Yet you emotionally abused me. You condemned me. You threatened me. You isolated me. You made me hate my father, hate my aunts and uncles, hate my cousins and relatives, and hate the church I attended. You made me hate everyone, distance from everyone, and then, I was alone, yet I still had a younger sister and brother to protect. But then, who would protect me? Do you remember how many days it took me begging you for you to take me to hospital for my broken hand? What about my knee? My spine? My concussion? Or and the time when I begged you to take me to the hospital because of an allergy attack? Remember how it took you nearly 10 hours before you and my father thought about taking me to the hospital. Remember how you guys still dragged your time and complained while reprimanding me while I was struggling to breathe? Remember how I basically had to check myself into the children's hospital ER? Or how I was in Crital Care for about 12 hours and then hospitalized for 4 days and has to use an oxygen tank to breathe up to the third? What about when I had nerve surgery on my right arm and you made me fill out my own paper work with my left hand because you didn't want to? Now that you know that my sister and I have depression, you say that I spread it to her. You said I brainwashed my sister to having fights with you and refusing you. You said that I am a baggage and burden for everyone around me and that I'm useless, dependant, and that I do nothing. In case you forgot, I pay for my car's maintenance. I pay for my college tuition myself. I bought my phone, ipad, and laptops. I even bought your phone and iPad. I'm only living with you because you wouldn't let me leave. Yet, I'm dependent? You say I don't do anything. Have you forgotten who manages the bills and doctor's appointments? Do you even know how you still have health insurance? Did you forget that when you called the police on my dad who slapped you, as reluctant as I was, I helped you translate and stood up as your witness to put my own father in jail? Did you forget how I had to go back and forth between the living room and kitchen to translate for the both of you so that you are both being represented properly before the law enforcers. Do you remember you telling me that you didn't want to put my dad in jail? That you just wanted to threaten him and scare him a little? Do you remember how, because of your ""punishment"" for my dad, because you realized he was the breadwinner of the house, because you didn't want to work, I had to rush downtown to the courthouse for the hearing after sending my brother onto his buss in just 15 minutes while trying to get a hold of you on the phone when you were supposed to be going to the court yourself by law. Do you remember how I almost died on my way because I didn't know the way, because I was in a hurry, and because I was dialing your phone and the prosector, all the while driving with my injured arms. I scraped my brand new car cuz I almost crashed into the bridge. Have you any idea how it feels to see your father in his jail uniform,, in that ugly and thin looking jumpsuit, when you're half the reason why he's there in the first place? My mom called the cops, but I said everything. Every word that condemned him was spoken through my own mouth. I placed him in jail. And yet the guilt i felt when I missed his first free call from inside the jail. The confusion and loss I could hear from the voice-mail. He didn't even know why they had him call someone, yet the first he thought of was my phone number and I didn't even answer. I charged 50 dollars into his name the moment I got the voice-mail because I felt guilty and afraid. He was skinny, scrawny infact, not to mention he was in jail because of domestic abuse, and he was chinese and didnt know english. I was afraid he'd get bullied because had he been bullied,, he was the foolish type to remain silent about it. When i finally got to the courthouse, I sat on the benches opposite the court, separated by a glass wall. After sitting through the whole 5 hour court hearing, I waited in the cold and dim county jail waiting room, on those hard metal benches from 12am to 11pm for my father's release. I didnt eat or drink anything for that whole day. There was no bathroom there. No power outlet for charging. No signal or wifi. After running across the street to make a phone call to my aunt where I had begged her to take my father in because he wasn't allowed to come home, I then had to run back and sit at metal benches by myself for the following hours, afraid to leave in case he gets released in between and doesn't know where I am. Unlike my mother who knows some English but pretends to not when its convenient, yet is able to flirt with guys online and call the cops just fine, my father doesn't speak English at all. I'm not saying my dad shouldn't have been punished for hitting my mother, but had your wife cheated on you and said she would continue, could you stand still? I protected my siblings in this whole incident. I had my sister and brother stay in the room so they wouldn't have to hear the things that was being said and wouldn't have to see our dad getting cuffed and taken away. I made sure both of my parents were represented. I only spoke the truth and didnt say anymore than that was asked of me when I could've said more like how you cheated. I was 19. I had just become of age. To this day, that whole experience was nothing but traumatizing. Then a year ago, my sister attempted suicide. So much happened, so much, yet how, how can you still tell me you love me. You abuse me and then act the victim.  How? How do you do this? What have I done wrong? What have I not done well enough? Was I not a good enough daughter? Was I not a good enough sister? Or was I simply not good enough because I'm me? Why do all of you treat me like this? Like I'm nothing? Am only a convience to you? Something you can use and toss away whenever. Was I born just to be used like a tool? Like how you got your immigrant status, how you got married, now how you're getting a divorce? I wish I could say thank you to you for giving birth to me and for coming to America, but I can't.  You didn't save me. She placed me in a place worse than Hell. I wish you never came here. I wish you had forgotten about me and remarried. I wish you had never married my dad. I wish you never gave birth to me. Before, though it was hell, I was numb and didn't have any hope, but when you came, you gave me hope and momentary care and attention, then you took it all away, tossed it about as you pleased, and stomped on it till it was nothing. I wish I didn't feel anything. I wish I never knew hope. I wish wasn't so smart. I wish I wasn't so useful. Had I truly been useless as you claim, perhaps you would've never given birth to me, then all of this I would not have to endure and experience. Had I never been born, I would be grateful to you. I wish I knew how to hate you."

Altruistic_Breakfast,depression,1620513066.0,A little bit angry that there are people who feel happy without meds and just by their own decision...,"Hi, I hope you are good. This is a rant. 

I'm jealous and angry rn bc some stupid bitch I know with loves to write stuff to show the world how happy and ecstatic she is in her life, wishing all the people happiness and peace and shit, and what bothers me the most is that deep down I am fully aware that's impossible and that the truth is you feel a sense of normal and peace in your life, but you cannot feel happy all the freaking time. 

I'm aware I'm being super jealous and judgemental,  thinking of the fact that I take antidepressants to feel okay every day, and I know I have way more reasons than this person to be happy, yet, I don't. I wouldn't trade my life with hers ever, I like the way I am, I just know that I clinically need the help of meds to be all right, but even without the meds, on the outside, I've always been the poster child of a good kid with good values and direction in life, which is all she's not. 

I KNOW I should be happy that they are happy, but it has cost me money, time and so much effort to be where I am right now for this stupid ass bitx to come and tell the world that she wishes everyone peace and happiness, like who gives her the right to do that?!

It's not that I don't wish others happiness and peace, of course, I do, but I don't feel entitled to say it like it's something that needs to be learned from ME, because I know it's a journey, and the NORMAL feeling to be in is a feeling of simply 'being', so I beg of everyone to understand that even if society is trying to tell us that we have to be HAPPY, it's not true, if anything you should feel peace within. 

I don't even know if I'm making any sense right now, I'm probably a horrible person, that's fine though. This is life, people go on trains and say random shit, others listen to Tony Robbins, and others listen to bitxes on facebook.

13547USERNAME,depression,1620514939.0,"We shouldn't tell people to ""stop caring what others think"". We need to teach people to stop judging others. Telling them stop caring what others think is like telling depressed people ""just cheer up"" or a blind person to ""just see"" or an anxious person ""stop being anxious"". That's NOT how it works.","Whenever a person says they are judged by others and don't wanna be judged by others, people will always say ""stop caring what others think who cares what they think"". This is terrible advice. A person doesn't just suddenly embrace being judged by others just because you told them to. In fact, it's exceptionally difficult to endure being judged let alone made fun of by others. Hypocritically, these same people don't give this kind of advice to gay people, transgender people, black people, promiscuous people, etc.

Before you say ""but LGBT people have been attacked or had their rights deprived of"" just keep in mind that if LGBT people didn't get attacked or killed and had all their rights but still got judged or teased by others, you'd STILL protest homophobia and transphobia. If you're gonna teach people to stop judging gay or trans people for example, then why when somebody gets made fun of for other kinds of characteristics they might have you instead just say ""stop caring what others think""?

Enduring stigma, judgment or even teasing by others is very difficult and damages a person's self-esteem and prevents people from being themselves. These people should be able to be themselves and feel high self-esteem without someone needing to ruin it all and judge them or ridicule them.

And many people who say they don't care what others think probably subconsciously do and don't realize it. But either way, just because YOU don't care what others think doesn't mean you have the audacity to expect others who get judged to feel the same way. We cannot just tolerate judgmental people and expect the stigmatized to endure the stigma. It's like telling a bullying victim ""just ignore"". It's like telling depressed people ""just cheer up"". It's like telling anxious people ""just stop being anxious"". It's like telling a homeless person ""just get a house"". That's not how humans work. We don't just stop caring what others think because you told us to.

We need to teach people to mind their own business and stop judging other people."

Wolf_er2020,depression,1620604765.0,The Reason I Don't Drink,"People are always weirded out by the fact I don't drink, do drugs, etc. The fact is I never tell anyone the main reason why I don't. I tell them it's for my health, but it's for more than just that. The other reason I don't is because I'm aware I might very likely become addicted due to my possible depression. Frankly, people who expect everyone to engage in stuff like that are just assholes to me. Insulting and belittling me for not wanting to drink nail polish smelling beverages (Seriously, the alcohol I smelled smelled like straight nail polish) shouldn't be a problem.

hazza987,depression,1620622107.0,Depression and OCD,"I've been depressed for over half my life now and I've always struggled in particular because I have OCD. This combination leads to the most horrendous intrusive thoughts. The worst isn't the vivid images of me mutilating myself, the worst are the ones that make me question my future and if there's any point in continuing. My dream is to become a film maker, specifically a director, and I've gone to university to study it. As I reach the end of my course I'm starting to realise that it's never going to happen and the thought of being stuck in a 9 to 5 job working for a corporation that barely knows I exist is soul crushing, I really don't think I could take it. I've worked jobs before rounding up shopping carts, being a kitchen porter, working as a bartender and I can't stand it. I just feel like the odds are stacked against me in every aspect. My depression and anxiety has really held me back socially to a point where I only just feeling like I'm starting to make friends at the end of the course and my final project, the first time I've been allowed to direct, fell through so I don't even have anything to show for my time at university. I'm leaving with nothing but debt, depression and a degree. I want to 'look on the bright side' but I don't see how anyone can in this world, a world where we claim to be fighting for equality but ignore the fact Muslims are being executed in concentration camps in China, a world where the environment is being destroyed by the greed of billion dollar companies that act like they give a fuck but then use children and slaves to build their empires, a world where even the people who swore to protect and serve the public are breaking into houses and executing people because of their own racist agenda.



I constantly have these thoughts swirling around in my brain which have made me start to question myself even more. I question myself on things I know are true. Things I've known are true for years I'm now unsure about because of how much I think about what I know and what knowing actually means. I've tried taking anti-depressants but they just make me feel empty and feel like they create a cloud in my brain that stops me from being able to think creatively.




I'm a broken shell of my former self and I'm at a point where I no longer feel like I'm living for myself, I'm only alive because other people want me to be. 

I'm sorry this turned into a rant I just don't know what to do anymore."

i went to a concert. i threw up, either becuase of bad sushi, or possibly because of nerves. I found myself in the venues bathroom. The bathroom was about 10 feet away from the stage through a wall. They played this song and hearing it through the wall helped bring me some comfort in a moment of need. Whenever I am laid low this song helps me.... 

🎶""It's okay to find the faith to saunter forward
With no fear of shadows spreading where you stand
And you'll breathe easier just knowing that the worst is all behind you
And the waves that tossed the raft all night have set you on dry land""🎶

FuzzKatty,depression,1620633365.0,I feel so numb I don't even feel sad anymore,"Sometimes I don't know if I'll ever feel an emotion again. I used to get chills at the end of a good movie. I used to feel so at peace daydreaming about living in the countryside, imagining the beauty of fields and trees and rivers and cabins in the woods. Just thinking about it put me in a sort of trance. When I read a book and the characters were hurting, I would feel horrible.

Sometimes I would wake up buzzing with happiness from a really good dream. The dream was perfect, it was beautiful, it was pure joy. I would spend the morning clinging to the feeling, as my memory of the dream faded away. It was the best feeling in the world. Then when I couldn't feel it anymore, I would be hit with this overwhelming feeling of emptiness. By comparison to that dream, my life was completely worthless and empty and dull. I would feel so hollow. Like I had been given a new perspective. If THAT was happiness, then what could I even call my real life? It was nothing in comparison. It was like I was being shown just how worthless and boring and meaningless and dull and useless and sad my existence really was. It was shattering. I had dreams like this maybe three or four times throughout my childhood. I can't remember a single thing about them except how great they were. And how real life was completely empty in comparison.

Through middle school, and freshman year of high school, I was the definition of stress and anxiety. My mental health hurt my grades, which hurt my mental health, which led to my mental situation near the end of my first year of high school. My brain was so fried, from years of stress, that we were doing conversions in class and I was completely out of it. I asked the guy next to me a clarifying question about the units. He laughed as he told me I had just tried to measure weight in inches. It sounds silly, but it shows just how burnt out I was. The brain fog was crazy.

Sometime in middle school I realized I felt numb. I cried myself to sleep wishing I could feel. That might sound silly too, crying because you can't feel as sad as you used to.

When I think about that now, I can logically recognize that I don't feel emotions that well, but that fact doesn't make me sad anymore. That's how numb I am.

I used to feel sad because I was so numb. But now all I feel is numb. Life really IS just that sad and meaningless thing I came back to after a wonderful dream. But I don't feel sad about it anymore. Because I can't. Logically, I can recognize that if my old self was watching my current self, he would probably be brought near tears of pity. And I envy him for it, though I can't feel the envy.

..

Also - just a question for whoever might see this: have you ever had one of those dreams I mentioned? It can't just be me, right?"

I've been struggling through the last few years with some bad times, bad life decisions, bad relationship for a few years... It was declining rapidly to the point of I couldn't stay calm unless I was drunk, dozed up or passed out. Today I'm trying to stay clear but I have also pulled myself away from any kind of expressing emotions and sharing my thoughts or anything for about the last 9 months. 

I know it's stupid but I always thought everyone is annoyed by me when I'm not ""funny me"". All my friends that I've expressed this feeling to before have assured me that's just in my head and they like me no matter what and I understand what they're saying but I just feel different. I feel that I'm tiring, boring, annoying and that's pretty much what drew me to stop talking to them about any of these. ( I also told them about that choice of mine with a mix of reactions...)

It wasn't an always easy time these last 9 month but I have to admit I had some periods in between when I just forgot about my thoughts and in general I was controlling it ok I guess.

Last month though I broke my leg, not an actual break more like I slightly cracked my ankle. So I stayed one month off work on my bed. But about halfway through I started feeling a bit weird again, like I was constantly bummed out but I chose to ignore it.

That feeling keeps on going since today but today it was my first panic attack after a long time. I was at a friend's house with two more guys and we were playing games together. While waiting for the next game to load I went to the toilet and I saw myself in the mirror while I was laughing about something and smiling. And like, I felt f***ed up. I was thinking like ""What are you smiling at? What's going on? Having fun? You're happy all of a sudden s***head?"" until I reached the point that I couldn't smile even if I tried. Started crying in the bathroom and lost control of my breathing. Until I snapped out of it washed my face and went back into the other room.

After writing all that, I realized that I don't know why I wrote that... I don't know if I ask for help or advice or anything to be honest. I just wanted to talk to someone about what happened. I don't know why. I just wanted to share it I guess and didn't want to be just the same old spam to my friends that I was beforehand.

Sorry for being too long I didn't want to waste anyone's time I just wrote what I thought."

I am still in the midst of the episode and am not doing very well at the moment. I just wanted to know if any of you experience physical pain alongside your depression. Have you spoken to a doctor about why this occurs if so? How do you deal with it? I hate painkillers but may have to take some because i'm so uncomfortable. I am starting to have migraines too which is rare for me. My body is so tense and I find it hard to relax."

WickedlyWilled,depression,1620617894.0,Does anyone else live in a state of constant existential dread?,"32 M here.  Just a figure among the broken.  Not sure what I seek to accomplish but another memoir to my anonymous audience.  

I’ve lived a solitary life, isolation is all I’ve ever known because I seem to lack the ability to relate to people or function in a social capacity.  For example I’ve never even made 1 friend.  Almost nobody knows anything at all about me.  There is no childhood adventure stories or college shenanigans.  It has always been me alone.  

The world is crushingly lonely and monotonous for me.  I hate my work routine but stick to it religiously out of the driving force of seeking security in life.  I spend weekends obsessing over how quickly time goes and accomplish little.

Long story short I’m a miserable human.  I am of no danger to anyone but myself I suppose.  I wake up and go to sleep wishing death or imagining suicide.  Just wish I could find more in life.  I hate the routine so bad but I’m too cowardly to leave it or kill myself.  My entire existence is trivial. 

I guess some part of me hopes that I’ll come across someone someday that presents some wisdom to me that enlightens a change in my outlook.  Otherwise don’t mind me I’ll just be here in my misery until I find my way to the hopefully sweet freedom release with death of conscious mind."

groovypidgeon,depression,1620635311.0,"I just don't care anymore, and I think that may prove to be my cure.","I really just don't care about life anymore. I've let go of hope and expectation, I feel like the only people I can dissapoint are others because I no longer feel the need to meet societies standards of success. I don't know if this makes me a nihilist, but it's like I realise that we are just animals. Every other species on the planet is content to survive...to eat, sleep, drink, fuck and socialise and that's it for them. But we humans have created a system which makes our lives so damn complicated and full of expectation.

I'm at university but have been failing all year due to depression and just feeling totally unmotivated and lost in my own head due to spending the best part of 2 years alone in my room. I'm no doubt going to fail this semester and lose my place, and yet...I'm okay with that. I realise that I'm not built to succeed, and to be honest the things I value and enjoy aren't the material things that we attribute to success. As long as I have my basic needs met, my health, the internet, movies, family and the odd luxury here and there then I think I can be perfectly content.

Maybe this is the release I need. I have been wallowing for so long in my sense of failure, that I'll never meet my own expectations, never have a good career, never have the perfect life. I feel like I could just get a not so bad job in a warehouse or store for 30 hours per week and be happy. 

Is this nihilism?"
Box-Just,depression,1620582886.0,I feel like there’s no point to anything in life.,"Hey guys, this is probably my first time positing about my mental health issue on a public forum. I’m not entirely sure what exact issues I face ( cuz they haven’t been diagnosed by a professional yet). But from my self diagnosis tests I may have a mild to mediocre depression + severe anxiety. I also have an OCD, body esteem issues & overthink.

I’ve been living in my thoughts for close to 5-6 years now. It started with a bad break up but it just spiralled down from there. The last 5-6 years have also been some of the best years of my life professionally.  I got selected, attended,  graduated from a Top tier business school, got a prestigious job, earn good money etc. I also dated a good guy after that but ended up breaking up with him cuz of distance.

These days I’m also dealing with issues about mediocrity, I feel like I’ve turned out average & will die unloved & unaccomplished . I’ve been abandoned by my friends many times , boyfriend so that’s another issue.

At this point, I’m so overwhelmed by thoughts that I definitely know that I need help. I just can’t get it at the moment ( I’m in a desi family so there are no boundaries for me to start taking virtual therapy). 

I don’t get self harm thoughts ( as yet?) but I do feel like everything is pointless. 

Like what’s the point of losing weight, it’s not like I’m a celeb, m just average nobody cares how I looks

What’s the point of money? What m I gonna buy with it? Car? Who cares? A beachside bungalow? Who cares? 

What’s the point of music? When I’m never gonna be famous for it? 

I know these are not normal thoughts & I do want to take action & get help. I’m just not sure where to start.

Would help if people can share their experiences & things that can help me atleast in the short term before I can start full time therapy & medications as recommended."

Truthfully, the pandemic was a bit of an excuse for me to avoid thinking about my future and my existence as a whole, but now that everything is starting to wind down and we’re returning to some sense of normalcy, I’m starting to feel shitty again. 

My brother got a job and he’s two years younger than me. It’s embarrassing, and I don’t have a lick of work experience except for volunteering maybe but it’s not the same. I got an eye exam the other day and one of the employees mentioned that she was the same age as me which was funny because she was already looking like a full-blown adult. Like I’m still relying on others for transportation for god’s sake because of my bad driving anxiety. Sure, I’ve applied to a few jobs and am waiting to hear back but what’s the point when I have very little skills and they probably won’t even consider me. They’ll have to be super desperate to want me. I do have an ideal job in mind that I want really badly but I’m terrified I’m going to be thrust into an environment I’m uncomfortable with and have to work with people that don’t care about me or my mental well-being. The dark stories I hear on social media don’t help my situation. 

It’s even worse because I don’t know what to do since I’m moving to a dorm in a few months for school and I wouldn’t be able to work for long before then. I’ve looked in to on-campus jobs but of course they’d be more competitive. Ugh. I’m just tired of feeling embarrassed for still depending on my mother for money.

The simple concept that you can get better here and now?

I'm fearing that my time's up once again. I've just found myself sliding back into terrible levels of apathy and agony, finding it harder to enjoy the simple things in life and near impossible to attend classes or take basic care for myself. I don't have the strength to kill myself or the strength to heal and move on; so here I am, just waiting and rotting. I dream sometimes, that I have a way out of this mess and can make my way in life. Sometimes I'm able to dip my toes in the water, feel it's not as cold as I thought, but it doesn't take long for me to remove them again. Music and sleep are my two only escapes now, minus here.

It just feels like I'm in purgatory, not dead but not alive either, just waiting to pass on. With how fucked my mental state is, it's not hard to think I never belonged here at all. Maybe to make some people happy but... dear god, nobody deserves to suffer like this."

It's been over a year since I've properly cut myself, but I had been cutting for about 2 years prior. It began on and off, but then I got addicted to the pain and cut every night for about a year and a half. One of my wounds got infected one night and I was scared that I had blood poisoning, and I freaked out and told my mum, who screamed and got my dad to look at my wrists too. They basically guilted me that night, saying how they ""thought they were raising a happy family"" and it just made me feel so much worse. My mum took me to A&E (essentially a walk in attached to a general hospital for anyone outside of the UK)? constantly saying how she didn't want me to get tested or diagnosed with anything because she doesn't want a child falling into that category(which essentially means that I can't get therapy or medication) after waiting about 2 hours, a nurse looked at my arms, asked me about 2 questions and said, ""well these cuts don't seem like you're suicidal"", and spent the next 20 minutes talking to my mum about covid. I havent talked to my parents about my mental health since because I know they'll just try and guilt me again, even talking to the school nurse didn't help because without a diagnosis they can't do anything.

For me, my mom was my grandmother, my Grammy. She passed away in at the end of January. I thought I would be okay by now. But I'm crying everyday. Blaming myself for not being there.

The last night I left the hospital I stood in the doorway for a long time. I stood in front of the elevator for a long time. I sat in my car. I didn't want to leave. The next day, I couldn't go back because someone in my house had Covid.

My Grammy had finally become more lucid. She was finally talking and called to ask when I'd be there. The next week she slipped away. She wouldn't answer the phone and the nurses were never available to put her on. Why didn't I call more? Why didn't I become more stubborn and wait until they were available??

I woke up crying on the 21st of January. I had a dream that she was gone. I got a call from a doctor less than an hour later and she was dying. They were reviving her, more than once. I managed to get ahold of my mother so she could be with her. But I was trapped. I wanted to be with my mom, but I was trapped.

I've been crying everyday since. Yesterday was the first time I had cried at work. All the Mothers' Day stuff. All the happiness. I was alone in the shop for a while and was sobbing between customers. I woke up today and was crying. I'm supposed to be at work in 30 minutes and I'm sobbing.

AMR929,depression,1620451215.0,Anyone else feel this way?!,"TL;DR: 
Does anyone else feel the same as I do?! 
I am a pretty laid back person and responsible person, but I feel as if I had to grow up too quickly! 

I feel that I had to grow up way too quickly for my age and I didn’t have a “teenage” years.. and now I’m trying to live them out in my 20’s and it’s very frowned upon. I want to go out and party and drink and experiment with different things.. and experience life! 

My dad passed away when I had just turned 15, and after that we had to grow up super quick. We went from a two income nuclear family to being a one income single parent household and it was hard. 
My brother and I all of a sudden became these two lost kids who had to take on adult responsibilities and worries when we were too young for that. 

My brother took our Dad’s death harder than I did, and he was ALWAYS in a bad mood and when he was in a bad mood, he put our mom in a bad mood. I tried not to ever show my emotion or be in a bad mood because I felt that our mom couldn’t handle two kids in bad moods.. so I suppressed A LOT of emotions from it and I’m still paying for it. 
So therefore at the end of the day, rather than having our mom worry about what a kid was doing, my brother and I were always home and never went out and did anything. I know we had the freedom to, but it was always that little guilt trip that our mom threw on us, so we didn’t go. 

I guess I’m kinda jealous of my friends because in high school they were doing high school things and going out but yet I was at home. I feel as if I was robbed of a normal teenage years and currently I am trying to live them out being 24, and it’s not feasible.. like I have to be a responsible adult because I have bills to pay. 

Kinda sucks.. but I guess it is what it is.. 

Anyways just seeing if anyone else feels this way about their childhood?! And if so, how do you cope with it or just accept being an adult?"

i’ve been struggling with my mental health since i was 13, and i’m 17 now. I got diagnosed with PTSD, and i have dissociation. i’ve been on antidepressants for 5 months now, and lately i’ve been having a hard time,, existing. 

my dad came into my room a few days ago, asking if we can talk.. he said i might get some of this mental ilness from him, because he also feels far away from reality, and his mother was also a bit ‘cookoo’ (they lived in communism so getting professional help wasn’t an option). From what i understood, he is depressed. he also told me he’s had some suicidal thoughts and ideas, but that too many people rely on him, or something along those lines, basically that he would do it if so many people wouldn’t suffer if he did it. then he said he hopes i won’t hurt myself, because he wouldn’t be able to live with it. he also told me he might want to go see my psychiatrist, so maybe ‘she can give him something to make him feel better’. this whole conversation absolutely blew my mind because he’s such an introvert, he doesn’t talk much, especially when it comes to his emotions. We’ve had a pretty close relationship, and we get along really well, although the lack of communication can be felt. 

what the hell do i do now? he’s away with my mom for the weekend at the sea, so he said to not talk to my psychiatrist yet, because maybe he’ll feel better after the sea, but i doubt it, since he’s been like this for a long time. he doesn’t leave his desk (since he works from home, he has his own company). and he hasn’t been smiling much lately. i genuinely don’t know what to do.

i’m trying to be there for him, to support him, to see how his day went and offer comfort. but what if he’s thoughts don’t go away? what if i lose him? what then?

how can i help him? 

PS: my grandma told me (without his consent) that he’s attempted suicide once before, when he was in his 20s... we always took his silent personality as simple introversion, but i’m thinking it’s much much more. 

let me know what you guys think; i can really use sole advice and support, i’m scared of losing him!"

Another-Response,depression,1620497952.0,Everyday I feel alone.,"Doesn't matter how many people I have in my life, I always feel alone. Can't shake the feeling and it's there 24/7.

Shift1228,depression,1620444616.0,Life is just a series of distractions?,"There are a lot of things I can do.

I can go play a video game or watch a show.

I can talk to friends.

I can work.

I can study

I can go out to eat

Any of these things might make you feel good for a minute. Then they end, and you return to your baseline feeling.

If that baseline feeling is self loathing, existential dread or boredom then what's the point?

Every possible activity is fleeting. I feel like life is a series of distractions, then I turn the monitor off or go sit on my bed and I realize I've felt the same way for a decade. I don't see any point in it anymore.

I could move or switch degrees or fix my addiction or try and meet people. At the end of the day I'd sit on my bed and feel the same. If its all just distracting yourself until you die, why do anything? Nothing lasts."
Minute-Limit-5249,depression,1620579057.0,Since no one commented the first time.... suicidal and feeling lost please help,"Hello Reddit. I’m not sure where to start with this but here goes nothing. When I was 6 years old I started to have thoughts of “I wasn’t meant to be born” and “the world would be better off with me not in it”. I’ve always struggled with depression (more specifically Major Depressive Disorder) and OCD and anxiety. Throughout my years, my mental illnesses have fluctuated between manageable or hardly noticeable to “holy shit my only thought today is about how I should kill myself”. I’m constantly terrified of the future, I have no direction in life, and no family now. I’m only 23. Last year my mother and her boyfriend were having issues and pushing at each other. In order to help stop the situation and stop from seeing my mother hit, I wrapped my arms around her so she would stop following and pushing at him. She decided I was the enemy in that moment and bit down on my arm, I had to go to the hospital the next day, and started to try hitting me. Luckily I’m much stronger than her so when I realized this, I simply got the upper hand, holding her hands down from trying to hit at my face while screaming for help. The next couple days after that when I would try to be there were bad; her boyfriend would threaten me with a knife and at that point I just left in my PJs and left. So now, i can’t even go to my mom. Everyday feels so helpless. Just going to work makes me want to get a hotel room and live out my days until I run out of money before killing myself. I genuinely can’t see how I’m supposed to work the next 30+ years while fighting in my head over killing myself, or thinking horrible, intrusive thoughts that give me back to back panic attacks. I feel like I’m just getting worse too. I wanted to try getting on medication but right now I live with my boyfriends family and he’s worried about how his parents will react to medication. I feel like no matter how hard I try at this point I’m probably gonna end up killing myself or in a mental hospital, and really isn’t what I want for me but I feel so hopeless and helpless"
PhrygianNoodles,depression,1620463951.0,Feeling insecure about my position in life,"I'm a 21 year old guy who has been suffering depression for about half of my life. Always had low energy, I've attempted suicide twice in the past, struggled with addiction, and now I'm just struggling to survive as a small pawn of the system. 

This has been eating me alive for so long and it manifests itself as rage. I'm tired of being looked down upon for working a minimum wage job and taking 4 years to finish community college. Believe me if I was smarter and could just figure things out quickly then I'd want to move ahead in life as quickly as possible. I just end up losing the battle everytime. I've had to retake college courses to pass them, I've struggled at every subject because my mind often just goes completely blank. I've tried applying to other jobs but I have no good experience or skills and I don't like bullshiting people because I value authenticity and that's the change I want to see in the world more than anything else. 

I get infuriated at the fact that I'm not desirable to women of any class because I'm just a minimum wage slave. I'm attractive enough that they want to have sex but they don't take me seriously because they see no potential in a guy with depression. I feel like I'm just pond scum at the bottom of the hierarchy. It makes me so bitter - being raised with these fairy tale ideas of love and romance and having these caricatures of what a relationship is shoved down your throat. Anymore, I can't figure out how we can have true love. Women just want rich and succesful men or a fuck toy or both. When they admire your sensitive side its because they can control you, when they admire your dominance is so you can screw them with more passion. They only seem to take. Societal expectations have only skyrocketed as the modern left has pushed for ""equality"". In reality theyve pushed us into slavery and degeneracy. We can't make love happen because people do not have pure intentions anymore. Nobody wants life to be a journey they can spend with their best friend. They just want to win. 

I want my life to be a journey, but to be able to accomplish truly helpful and amazing things.

I have dreams and goals that I put off because I can't figure out how to make anything of them. I suck at figuring out realistic steps and how to bring about change. My attention span is so small and I was diagnosed with add, tourettes, and was considered possibly aspergers from a young age. I have tons of physical injuries that prevent me from doing blue collar work, and I'm too forgetful to work a white collar job. 

I just work in a kitchen and while I'm decent, it's useless skill that no one cares about. I've turned down the management positions because I can't stand the company and I don't see myself as a manager. 

Its heartbreaking realizing that us sensitive and damaged people cant change the world. We are fuck-ups and nobody cares if you can spot corruption, read people well, or come up with new ideas. You will ONLY BE USED. I guess I'm just the rare sensitive type who wants to achieve greatness and feel like I'm in top of the world. I want to change everyone in some way because I can't stand the behavior they claim to be logical but really just boils down to them being slaves to our fucked up system. I try to call it out and everyone is just like ""what are we going to do? What are you going to do? You are nobody"". 

I dream about being put together enough to get through to people. About being somebody who can be looked up to and respected for their opinion. But somehow money and class are the only means to this. It doesn't matter that I've made the best of my brain's traits (even while having mental disabilities), it doesn't matter that I even try. You just have to be born destined for greatness or sell your soul (figuratively speaking). 

Sure I could try getting a trade job like everyone begs me to. And what? Spend the rest of my life slaving away for something i don't care about? At least in a kitchen i can talk about philosophy, make great food, and I have hours which aren't crippling me. 

It's just that I don't have enough money to do much besides survive. I am not deemed valuable enough by the system and it hurts so terribly. My ego wants to protect me from being seen as utter shit and so this is why I'm even making this post. Maybe somebody could reach out and offer some advice. You don't have to justify my complaints because I know I'm pathetic. I'm just a loser by definition. But maybe something will happen that gets overlooked when I mull over this pain in my head 24/7."
itiswhatiteeez,depression,1620613044.0,does this sound like depression?,"I don’t really know where to start. I’ve definitely felt this feeling before but it goes away, sometimes I’m almost on a high but then I crash one day. 

I recently turned 25 and I noticed as of late it’s almost hard to get out of bed. To put this in perspective I thought I had covid lol (I’ve already experienced it with major fatigue) because I woke up feeling so tired for the 3rd day in a row to the point where I’m showing up late to work because I can’t get up. It feels like everything hurts, my head, my legs too? and it’s a bit of struggle finding the motivation to do things. 

When I do go to work, I feel this weird stress and anxiety. Like I can’t stand still. Sometimes I go into the washroom at work and sit there and have these negative thoughts. I just can’t wait for it to be over. I got home now and I don’t know if they’re invasive thoughts but I keep internally saying things like “can I just die” or “I wish I could sleep for a week to move past this”

Another thing I’ve noticed is drinking behaviour. I get very down now when I drink and normally I’m in a good, cheery mood. 

Has anyone experienced the same thing?"
chewybacbacca,depression,1620630174.0,Tired of people saying that gen z is fake depressed and that we’ve made it trendy.,"All one has to do is look at the rising suicide rates over the years(I know it’s been on the rise for years in the US) and the fact that social media has caused our generation to be more lonely, detached, and anxious than ever before. 

I guess what made me write this is that I’ve read countless “unpopular opinions” about how Billie Eilish is overrated because she writes depressing music to be trendy and that she’s only “fake depressed”. Little do they know, she’s talked about how she used to self harm in bathrooms and has had suicidal thoughts. 

I do think it’s become fairly popular nowadays to “gate-keep” depression. Now you have to prove you’re actually depressed in order for people to initiate you into this depression club they’ve formed. If you smile a few times with your friends or take social pics for Instagram, those gatekeepers think it’s impossible for you to be depressed. You make one dark-humored joke about having depression, they’ll say you’re only doing it because it’s trendy; not because you’re actually depressed. 

Gate-keeping depression is weird. ANYONE can be depressed and even suicidal. Rich or poor. Conventionally attractive or not. In a committed relationship or not. That person you see who’s bubbly in person could be putting up a facade so you can’t see just how broken, damaged, and helpless they feel internally.

Gate-keeping depression does way more harm than good(if there’s any good at all) because what if that person who’s in serious need of help decides to attempt suicide—not to actually die but solely to be taken serious and to avoid people saying they’re seeking attention."

Why should I celebrate a person who has brought me nothing but misery and pain. A person who cares more about her status in society than my well being. Fuck her the only time she’ll care is when I commit suicide, will she cry because she lost a child or cry because she failed as a parent. My whole childhood was filled with heartache  from both parents. When I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety my therapist told both my parents about how they need to change that’s was 3-4 months ago and have they changed NO. The whole day currently she has shouted at me, humiliated me and so on I truly do hate my parents and I often fantasy about them dying.I don’t care about them and I don’t care about myself either"

I don’t even know where to start. If you feel like this comment below so I know I’m not alone & we can get through this shit together. 
Okay so where do I even start lmao. I literally treat reddit like my therapist. 
First of all this Covid lockdown is literally killing me mentally. I’ve been just on airplane mode if you know what I mean .. I’m here but everything is autopilot mode. I don’t think of things I’m just day dreaming or not even I literally have nothing in my head lmao it’s just silent and I’m just doing my things. 
I moved to another province a year ago and I have friends but god do I ever feel alone. I always feel alone no mater what where or who I am with. My friends here have their own groups and that’s totally okay with that. But when I’m with them I always feel like I’m talking too much or not saying enough or I am extremely boring and they just want to go home. Because they don’t hangout with me the way their own group does WHICH AGAIN I understand because I’m their new friend and they have been friends for years. 
I feel this emptiness in my chest, I just wanna scream at the world for nothing. I am tired of sitting at home 24/7 and it is so extremely hard to get a job right now and I am so unmotivated to do anything. And trust me I’ve tried doing shit. I’m thinking maybe this is because I’ve had a lot going on last year from 2019-2020 because my best friend had cancer and passed away and I haven really touched into that. I know she’s gone but I have not come to terms with it. I don’t know how. I think I just stored it away and god knows when I can deal with it. I cry and I’m sad sometimes that she’s no longer here but I’m not sure if I have grieved Normally ??  I just had a crying stage stressed stage I couldn’t believe it and I still can’t. Pls don’t tell me it’s unhealthy I know it is but I don’t know how to deal with it. 
Basically I feel empty for no reason sometimes. Last week I had a heard week for some reason just a lot of emotions built up I went for a walk and just started bawling my eyes out and the weird thing is it was so cloudy outside and the sun literally was shining above me it felt like a warm hug from my friend. Anyways I feel weird sad like I’m not even here just autopilot mode."

These past months I've been feeling off after what happened. I lost the love of my life and I've been having a hard time coping.

notds570,depression,1620480394.0,Tired of being tired in the wake of an ever-growing hellish existence,"I (20m) moved away from college about a year ago in order to pursue my dream of being a touring musician. At the time, I had just broken up w my ex, and things were not looking up in the city that I was in, so I moved home. Then COVID-19 hit, and I was forced to stay in my hometown at my parents house, while waiting for a global pandemic to run its course. My parents and I do not get along. We disagree fundamentally on almost every issue and this leads to a lot of what seems like normal conversations, turning into these full blown screaming matches. It seems like everyday that I’m stuck here is chipping away at my soul slowly and slowly. Everyday is the same, I wake up, hit my vape, procrastinate eating until I feel I am about to pass out, skate, practice music, go to work, sleep, repeat.  I feel as if I have been undergoing the same existential crisis that I experienced the first time I tripped acid back in 2018. The question of “Why the actual fuck am I here? I didn’t ask for this hellish existence”. It doesn’t seem fair to me, and it’s DEFINITELY not fair to tell me to “take it al to God.” “God gives us meaning” like I haven’t literally taken courses and read books on defending Christianity and why that gives us meaning, but it wasn’t enough. I found myself still asking why and because of this, my “friends” that I had in the church didn’t want to be around someone who didn’t believe the same as them, so they decidedly went their own ways. And the fact that all of my friends and bandmates live in other cities, my closest family member (my cousin) lives 2 hours away and everyday I seem to battle this detrimental feeling of loneliness that won’t go away. I wouldn’t say that I’m suicidal, but I just don’t want to live everyday of my existence anxious, tired, and so fucking sad."

thatsuicidalguy,depression,1620431197.0,Seeking help regarding my deteriorating mental health.,"Addressing the mental health professionals here, I'd like your advice and maybe a probable diagnosis for my mental health condition. 

NOTE: I haven't been officially diagnosed with any condition yet.

A little background: I'm a 19 year old male from India and in med school. I'm introverted, a loner and single. I'm interested in existential philosophy and started pondering the ""big questions"" quite early on in life. I was misdiagnosed as Manic Depressive Bipolar when I was 15 and was on Lithium for 2 years. My then psychiatrist diagnosed me on the basis of self harming, substance abuse and anger issues.
These factors might have a contribution to my rapidly deteriorating mental health presently, hence the brief mention.


Ever since the Covid 19 cases increased in our country, our college sent us back home and I lost connections with all my friends. I live with my sister who's a doctor and is quite busy  so I have the house to myself most of the time. 

It's been pretty gloomy for me for the past 2 months and I deal with recurring phases of intense melancholy and loneliness. Hours go by without me uttering a single word. 

I was quarantined for 14 days due to my sister being diagnosed of Covid-19 during which the signs of depression started reappearing. I could manage them back then but now they're even stronger rendering me incapable of leaving the house. 

I've lost interest in all my hobbies (I loved playing guitar, exercising and talking) and spend most of the time in bed. It's been 3 days since I've taken a bath. I'm used to feeling the urge to stay in bed and not do anything fun for quite a while but it's been intense especially for the past 3 days. 

I couldn't muster up the energy to talk with my mother on her birthday yesterday. I've lost track of time and have a difficulty feeling emotions. 
I haven't cried in a year. 

I'm extremely fatigued all the time, barely manage to eat one meal and smoke 3-4 cigarettes everyday. There's this intense feeling of doom and worthlessness that I feel almost all the time. 

I feel like there's an invisible wall between me and the world and that as hard as I try I cannot truly connect with the world. My emotions are numb and I often have to resort to extreme situations (Like watching videos of people dying, suicide documentaries, etc.) to feel a small amount of emotion. I'm completely detached from the self and everyone around me. My visions kinda hazy and I have trouble focusing on the present moment. 

I was suicidal in my teens and self harmed a lot but now I can control the urges. However, I'd say I'm passively suicidal because deep down I do want to die but don't actively pursue death. I would be glad if a bus runs me over someday.


My previous psychiatrist said that I might have something called Depersonalization Derealization Disorder due to my past history of trauma (Sexual assault, neglect and isolation) but we moved before I got a confirmation on the diagnosis. I haven't had a psych appointment in more than a year or so. 

I know as a professional you're not supposed to diagnose people online but it would be really helpful if anyone can point in the right direction and maybe advice what I should do next. Thank you for reading the entire thing and for sharing your opinions and advice."

tartist8,depression,1620558444.0,I was diagnosed a few days ago.,"Hey.  As the title suggests I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety day before yesterday.  I originally sought help from a therapist because I thought that I was showing several symptoms of autism or Asperger's Syndrome.  While those two options aren't necessarily off the table, it took about three weeks of therapy for my therapist to determine that I was instead mostly suffering from intense anxiety and severe depression.  I don't entirely know about what variety or exact severity he thinks I'm afflicted with (We're going into more details on Tuesday), but he linked me up with a psychiatrist who's going to get me on some medication in about three weeks.  I'm very nervous and reluctant, as I know a few people who have depression, but they had given up on treatment because nothing seems to work out for them.  However, I do have some hope because there are also a few people I know who've greatly benefited from taking medication and attending therapy (including my therapist himself).  I was also a bit surprised how much my therapist urged me to get rid of my handgun that I keep on the side of my bed.  I told him a few times that when I'm feeling extremely anxious or completely hopeless, I'll usually chamber a round and brandish the weapon with the safety off.  I complied and handed over my handgun to a trusted ex coworker yesterday, with very strict and specific instructions to not give it back to me unless I have explicit permission from either my mother or my best friend.  While I still have access to methods, the unreliability of the methods at hand greatly turn me off from seriously considering to attempt suicide.  Ah, sorry for rambling.  What I'm really here for is advice.  The thoughts that I'm having and the emotions that I'm feeling have been with me for as long as I can remember.  Is there anything extra I can do outside of therapy to boost my mood within a low moment?  Of course, I'm looking to ask these specific questions when Tuesday rolls around, but I'm open to different perspectives on the matter.  Thank you all."

imissfoodsm,depression,1620586033.0,Wish I had something going on,"I dropped out of school when I was 15 and it's been three years almost. I see my friends with depression--one had dropped out around the same time as me but completed her examination, another who graduated with a failing grade but is doing her best at online schooling and I feel like a complete failure. All I had been doing for the past three years was nothing. At some point in the beginning, I was writing and drawing and reading and picking up some study materials because I decided I should at least try to complete my exams but at this point I've given up on myself.

I gave up art, try to at least preserve my writing but still give up, I barely read and I haven't had an actual conversation with my friends in a week and haven't met them since the start of the year. I've given up on my studies too. I want to but I just feel like a failure and I'm afraid of everything. I can't tell honestly if there is something wrong with me or if I'm judt lazy. I feel guilty every day being here because my parent does not get angry at my existence and my sibling has given up on me. At some point I had tried helping myself up, sleeping early, waking early, working out, studying, reading, but all attempts have ended in failure.

I wish I was strong enough to hold my own and turn myself around. I try to tell myself that everything will be okay and distract myself in the present because I hate being reminded of my life and myself. I really dislike myself, at least the me right now. I want to change but change is so harr and I wish telling myself that I could do it works like it used it but I'm so upset and confused with myself and all I want is for me to disappear and lift the burden off everybody's shoulders because as much as I hate to face it I really am a failure"

Ken_Valerious,depression,1620493482.0,I feel like i'm trapped in a dark box of deperssion,"My story is too long and I don't know where to start but my whole life is falling apart, and i can't handle it anymore, can't think of anything that would make me happy again, i lost my passion in life. 

It all started a couple years ago when i left my country due to the civil war that destroyed every place i knew in my childhood, even my colege my home i lost it all. I witnesd alot of horrible things during the war, but i was able to escape at the end and now i live as a refugee in a new country away from every person i knew in my life, my family, my friends .. i left them all behind.
I tried to start here from zero, but i couldn't
I don't know anyone here, i failed to learn the new language to communicate with the people here. I tried to find a job but i couldn't and now i gaveup on the idia of me getting a job again, and i couldn't even get axcepted in any colege or school ,i feel like i'm no one, i'm just a pathetic person, 
After a year has passed since i moved to here, i recived a call that my father has cancer and they could not give him any medical help in my home country because of the situation after the war. A few months after that he died from the cancer, died while i was away i couldn't see him for years and i lost him.
My mom had cancer in the past but she cured and after both my parents had it now i have the fear of having cancer genes.
During all of those frustrsting things that i was facing, something gave me a little hope, like a little light in the end of the tunnel, when by chance i met a girl that i knew in the past and we had a crush on each others many years ago , she was a refugee here like me but she was here before me, she knew everything here, she speak the language perfectly, so she started to help me get on my feet again, we fall in love with each other i thought of her like if she is my only hope in life, i treated her like a god, loved her to the point that i offered my life to her,
But the disaster happened, she start to change with me, and all the sudden, she wanted a break up, telling me that she is not in love in me anymore and treated me like i'm the worst person in the world, i couldn't handle my self, she meant everything to me, i begged her to stay , i cried, i tried everything but no , she dumped me, at the end i felt so angry, i texted her with the most insulting words you could imagine, i sent here measseges that will make her hate me for the rest of her life and then i blocked her.
The next day i felt so guilty that i didn't respect her choice i kept thinking and thinking, i gave my self time and after a month a tried to contact her again asking for another chance from her just to let me back in her life as a friend, but she refused in a very bad way, she insulted me, humiliated me, made me feel like the most horrible person on the planet, i tried alot to get her back in my life, at the end she accepted to let me in her life as a friend but she started to treat me in the most humiliating way, telling me that i'm nothing to her, and that now she has a Fu×K-Body, and enjoing sleeping with him and i will be nothing like him, and when i heared that i got so angry, it hurts me so bad, i couldn't handle my self, started to insult her telling her i don't want to know her i want her just to disappear, and that was two days ago.
After the things I told her, I'm sure i lost her forever. And i started to remember everything happened to me, all my losts, how my life is a complete mess, i lost the last bit of hope, I really need to end my self, I can't enjoy anything , i wish just to die and end this suffer."
Exc011,depression,1620511166.0,Never thought it would be this hard to find a lover.,For the past 4 years of my life relationships have pretty much been the only topic of conversation. My problem is that I’m either too nice to a girl or she can “only see me as a friend” and after all the rejections which have been thrown at me again and again and again I still for some reason think that in the future I will know what it feels like to have someone love and think about you everyday.
theassinpotassium,depression,1620458565.0,How do I ask my therapist for more frequent appointments?,"I've been seeing my therapist monthly for several years. My husband and I also see an LMFT bi-weekly and have been for the past year-ish. Our LMFT suggested I ask for more frequent appointments with my therapist, which I agreed to do. Unfortunately, at my last appointment with my therapist (29 April), right as I was about to ask, he apologized saying he did not have even a half hour open in May, so offered 8 June. I agreed to that because he mentioned scheduling ""...for my more needy patients,"" implying I'm not one of those. I still felt discouraged, sad, and cried after that appointment because one of the last things he told me was ""you miss your partner,"" and it hit hard how much I miss my husband. (see note at bottom)

Now earlier in April, my therapist offered me a 30 minute call out of the blue saying ""I know you don't have any support so here I am,"" which moved me almost to tears because I know he has a lot of patients. I work for the same organization just in a different department, and have my own patients to keep track of so I understand the stress it can cause. Perhaps I am incorrect in assuming I would be seen more frequently if he thought I needed it. I know I need to communicate this, I'm just not sure how. I also feel fearful of becoming a needy patient.

Just FYI, my husband is in military training and will be away for at least a year. Our home is an 8-10 hour flight from any friends or family, which is also how far his training is from me. I have MDD, insomnia, and recently diagnosed ADD/ADHD. I'm used to being depressed/tired for no reason, but now it's worsened by my situation and I do feel I am struggling to cope.

Thank you to anyone who read this."

jenobles1,depression,1620526833.0,I have no one,"I started feeling down, and after talking to my therapist realized people don't know how I feel and what I need unless I open up and ask. So I tried, multiple times.

Have said I am sad, have asked if I really suck at everything, have said I can't see anything positive in myself, hell how now even asked why am I ignored each time. Still always ignored. All this did was make me feel more alone and everything. Someone I thought was my best friend even, who I have been there for over and over again. Just silence. Then will talk to me about something completely unrelated, with my unanswered text right there. 

All my thoughts were just my own assumptions and now it's like nope not just mine apparently everything I feel about myself must be true if nothing negating it can be said.

plantlifefortwo,depression,1620422319.0,Hey everyone,"So I let me start this out by saying im not suicidal. Not that my story is any harder than anyone else’s but it’s just heavy emotionally and it feels weird. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression after my second overdose at around 16-17. The therapist thought I was suicidal since the incidents were close together but I wasn’t and it wasn’t an attempt. They gave me meds and I never took them and just never believed I had anxiety or depression. I’m now 26 and believe it’s a possibility. Within the last 3 months I got over a tianeptine addiction (70 days free) and am still dealing with the post acute withdrawls. I feel very lightheaded and emotionless and hollow about every day and have bursts of crying that come out of nowhere often too. I believe I’ve had a few manic episodes as well, and adhd symptoms constantly and de-realization sometimes. It sounds like there’s a possibility I could have bipolar 1 and have 2 appointments coming up soon to see what it could be. I’m just hoping they don’t charge much as I’m broke and have no insurance. About the same time I quit tianeptine I broke up with my almost 3year now ex girlfriend. I’m still crying over this often but it’s normal to be that way after a breakup. In ending this relationship, it cost me my dream job working at an animal sanctuary where I was the primary caretaker of over 170 animals. I got the job due to her as she works there too and is best friends with the women in charge. I believe she fired me due to breaking up with my ex, (her best friend) my ex knew nothing of my tianeptine addiction. I’ve since had to move back home with family and have found a job doing lawn care although it doesn’t pay much but it’s something for now. I just don’t know what to do, as I never went to college, have no money, and i am . Felon so that makes everything a bit harder. Almost every day I have random bouts of depression And anxiety that seem to come from nowhere. Often it just seems hopeless and pointless. I have no real friends either. I met a girl through a friend on Instagram and we’ve been talking daily for two months  and now are a couple and Videochat all day everyday so I have her and she’s a great help on my mental/emotional health. Regardless I still feel overwhelmingly hollow and emotionless most days and it fucking sucks. This could all be from the tianeptine use, but it just feels like I’ll never get better. I currently don’t drink or do drugs and won’t. I don’t really know what I hoped to get out of this but it’s nice to type it out and figure maybe it will help. Have a good day everyone and keep fighting."
jozlem,depression,1620632626.0,"help, i don't even know what i have and i'm not good","hi all. i'm 15, and it's been a year (since march 2020) that my life changed. in a negative way, though. here's a story of what i had: memory problems, concentration problems and some types of headaches. i still have them. never had things like this before, fun fact? in 2019 i was able to read things and remember anything. 

but let's get into the problem. i am stressed a lot becouse of school, in my country a lot of students are having problems with it; stress, anxiety, depression and so on. 

but when i have free days (so no lessons) i sleep weel and exercise (not really tho since gyms are closed, but i play football for hours) but i can't find a solution. 

i still have a strange feeling in my mind, not that i feel so much but i think has an impact on my learning.

i want to read books but can't even concentrate or remember. i feel empty. 

i first thought it was brain fog, but i see that my head has less pains nowadays, but still i have memory and concentration problems. i just feel like i read words without understand anything and of course not even remembering them. 

i don't know what to do. i am desperate. i'm just 15 and probably i'll have no future. i want to read for myself, but i can't. i can't do any fucking thing anymore. if this will continue for years, i'll put a rope on my neck."
Peezashiz,depression,1620570616.0,I wish I didn't open up to my family that I keep having suicidal thoughts.,"When they think of depression, they thought that I was simply sad when in fact, I am not sad and I'm not in denial. It's just that I want to die so badly because I feel like everything is worthless. I have no motivation, I don't have plans for the future, I just want to die but at the same time I'm scared. What if I don't die and end up disabled? 

My sister said that they are trying their everything to cure me. The fact that I'm still like this, disappoints them because I am still ""not cured"". And that there must be something wrong with me that I'm not trying my best. I ""am"" trying my best. It's just that depression can't be cured. I might look like I'm happy but deep down, I am not. I'm afraid they will think that I am just faking because I'm open to them about it. I couldn't help it. It was too much for me to bear so I called out to them. Now I'm regretting it. I wish I just kept it to myself so that they wouldn't be burdened. I could feel that they are burdened by me. That's what they're making me feel. They think I'm faking it because I have no reason to be sad.... Yes,.I have no reason to be sad but there's so denying that I keep on thinking of dying every single day.

She makes it sound so easy that ""when she is depressed, she just convince herself not to be depressed"". How does that work? I don't know. Maybe I'm not depressed because I am not helping myself just like they said? Please help me I need someone who understands me.

I don't even know if I really have depression anymore. I had a breakdown today and because of me, my mom doesn't feel well today because of me. I just wanna die so bad so bad."

I’ve dealt with mental health issues for a good portion of my life but it’s becoming to much and it’s all my fault. I started to self-harm as a way to punish myself and it seems to be the only way that’s helping.

For years I’ve struggled with porn addiction, maybe since I was 14-15. And because I find the idea of sexualizing people weird, I decided I would masturbate to furry/cartoon character pornography. Looking back on it all, most of it is okay but there were some things that I saw, thought and read that contained characters that shouldn’t be sexualized(I’m talking underage cartoon characters). And I knew it was wrong, so I just envisioned them to be off-age or since they looked older in pictures I thought it was okay. Like I said it wasn’t all the time, and all of them were non human.

The worst offense I don’t even know if it happened. I struggle with various types of OCD, and sometimes I remember or at least I think I remember memories, basically false memories. Well I’m worried that I masturbated to an underage human cartoon character(someone from dragon ball). Because I saw a censored version of it on a YouTube comedy video. I’m leaning towards it not happening, but I can’t shake the feeling that something happened.

I can’t take all this anymore because just wanna die but I’m afraid of going to hell. I’m 20 and I still don’t have a job and I’m not in college and I live with an emotionally distant and fucked up family. I don’t deserve to be happy.

I’m on antidepressants now for about two months which is greatly helping my symptoms such as no energy, lack of appetite, brain fog and I feel I can function semi normally. But it doesn’t change the fact that life feels like I’m just waiting to get through till the end. I don’t want to die and I used to love life and think it was a beautiful, amazing experience but for the last two years my depression has steadily gotten worse. Thankfully my antidepressants are allowing me to go through the motions of day to day living and is helping me to get through uni and attempting to make new friends and establish myself in my country of birth, due to covid. But I feel like I don’t resonate with anyone and besides that I don’t feel I have much to say.

I feel like I’m waiting for something to happen, a moment, a new passion, a person to come along to help raise me up, to inspire me, but no one and nothing has come and I can’t be bothered to try anymore.

At first, I thought I could overcome the coding classes just like I did Calculus 1, 2 and 3 but when I see others achieving something nigh effortlessly it just CRUSHES my will to practice or do anything about it. I have been diagnosed with depression before and I thought I had gotten over it, to a degree at least. I also lost my grandfather a few months back  due to covid and he believed in me more than I believe in myself. I came here because I feel I just need to vent everything and I am at a brink of screaming from the top of my lungs. I can't do anything by myself or at least the hard stuff. For example, there was this test for a class about circuits and stuff and I failed the first test and I just could not afford to fail the second one (which was the last partial exam) so out of desperation I used chegg with the rest of the class to answer the entirety of the test.  I just want to do what I like for the rest of my miserable life and simply disappear from the face of the Earth. I guess you could say that I am some sort of narcissist and I would not say you are wrong.

I'm in love with the girlfriend of my best friend and this is the one thing that brings me down **(because it shows what a bad friend I am, but that's another topic, I just felt like telling you this)** so I tried to distance myself from this group of friends, to see if I'll curb my feelings towards her.  


So I guess I'm searching for your help.  
I know it's going to be easier to search on the web ""how not to be depressed"" or ""how to be motivated"" and all this kind of bs, but I think that I would nicer and more helpful if an actual human told me how to act at this point in time of my life.

Being alone really is horrible. The thing is, i’m not such an introvert, i actually try to engage in conversation and bring up some cool topics, but unfortunately not many people are cool like that, or want to do anything with me. it sucks. i miss my old best friend, she was a girl, she listened to me whenever and i would do the same, it was a true and great friendship, i really loved her, obviously i never saw us as a couple or anything, i genuinely liked her as a friend. Then i got pissed over a little thing she posted and i cut her off slowly and slowly and i failed to realize that our friendship faded away all because of me. now i’m alone, i can’t find someone like her.  fuckkk i don’t know why i still have the same problems from years ago. i need to move on. we still follow each other on instagram if that means anything. after losing her i just realized how lonely and pathetic i am. anyways, i’m getting deep into this because lately this week my mental health has not been okay and i just been dealing so much with it. lately i’ve been waking up with a feeling to just die, to leave. i’m going to college soon, not a great college, i’ll be in the city, meaning i’ll probably still be in the same situation i am right now in 5 years or so. i have decent grades so i’m hoping maybe i can transfer and go to a big good college, after that maybe try to live differently. i need to work on myself though, i need to workout and take care of myself, i can see why i don’t have a girl or anything, which is not my biggest concern. if i can’t get a friend then what makes me think i can get a girl 😂. but yeah, life is just repetitive at this point, it make me even question what the point of it is. one thing i can promise is i’ll never hurt myself or anyone else. i’ll just cry in silence. there’s really nothing i can do but move on, i can’t imagine being happy. genuine happiness."

I look around and see how everyone is born to be loved, born to be happy. Well I'm born to die, but even that I can't succeed at. 

I used to think that pain was better than nothing, because it gives us purpose and reminds us why we live. I now only agree with the last part, because I now realize that I live to die. That just happens to be my purpose

I don't fucking know what's wrong with me, why I am so deformed, unloved, unwanted. The thing keeping me from hitting or cutting myself is that I don't want to become even uglier. 

And to end it all... I don't have the fucking guts for that anyway. Even looking at my wrists thinking of how easy it is to cut them makes me cry like a fucking baby. It feels like I don't have anything to actually live for, but still leave behind too much if I were to commit suicide. I have loving parents, a couple of good friends, I'm a good student and should be looking forward to a great career. Yet the only thing I can think of is my destiny for death and how much better it would've been if I hadn't been born at all. I know that's what I want and I'm pretty convinced the rest of the world would be better off as well.

SnooGuavas620,depression,1620438697.0,Faking it,"I got pulled into my manager's office and sat down with HR, and told to shape up. I wanna seek help, but I have gotten burned for this.

Working for a defense contractor, I have to hold a clearance, and so the therapist thing is a bit more complicated. Doctors can tag you with shit and ruin your career, apparently, so I'm scared of doctors being petty. If you're not sure what I mean by this, I should explain saying to a therapist that I was scared about what seeing a therapist would do for my clearance, she decided to tag me with ""paranoid personality disorder"" because I was scared what seeing a therapist would potentially do to my clearance, and I got a 14 page questionaire from the clearance folks asking for excessive amount of details for explaining myself after they talked to her. FML for reaching out for help when every thing about my life is under a microscope for a clearance. That whole situation was fucking awful.

I've been trying my hardest to hide it all since. I feel like I am performing a circus act, spinning plates, and hoping they don't fall. I reached out to the Employee Assistance Program, and tried that route, and I have to say, the therapist didn't seem to really help. She seemed kind of batty to me. I tried a therapist outside of work and she was hard to open up to and turned downright petty towards me so I stopped seeing her, particularly after the bullshit ""paranoid personality disorder"" tag I got for being concerned about talking to her with having a clearance. I can't seem to find a good therapist, so at work, I'm just trying to save face. This sucks. I wish the clearance didn't ask about mental health. Retaliation is real."

4morian5,depression,1620625413.0,Dying seems like a good option,"I've never been here, and I don't know if commiserating with a bunch of other depressed people is healthy, but I have nowhere else to vent.

I am just...so...tired. I am tired of staying up until I'm delirious from exhaustion because the other option is laying there while my brain goes over, in minute detail, what a POS I am. I'm tired of going to sleep agonizing over what a terrible place the world is, and I'm tired of waking up to find it's somehow gotteb worse.

I'm tired of brushing my teeth in the hall and shaving in the shower because I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. I'm tired of wearing long sleeves in the summer to cover my self-inflicted scratch wounds, old and new. I'm tired of watching the same shows and playing the same games because the new terrifies me.

And I'm tired of feeling alone. My friends and family say,"" We're here for you, you can talk to us."" Bullshit. Whenever I try to take them up on that, or have a ""moment"", they hightail it. ""You're freaking me out."" ""You're pissing me off"" ""Ugh, can we talk about this later"" ""I'll come back when you've calmed down"" and the worst, from my mom, ""I will commit you if I have to, so pull yourself together."" After nearly being commited by the psychologist I saw once a year as part of my counseling, I became withdrawn. I can't express any negative emotion besides anger, which for some reason is more acceptable for men than crying. I wanted to cry over sonething sad, and I couldn't. I just got nauseous.

I don't expect anyone to read this, or care. I certainly don't care about myself much. I just...want to quit.

You know when you're a kid, learning little life lessons? One of those was that if there's sonething unpleasant you HAVE to do, it's better to just do it and get it over with.

Death is just about the worst thing that can happen to you, and everyone HAS to do it. Why not just get it over with, spare yourself all the pain and fear of life?"
Icy-Study-3679,depression,1620427171.0,How do you even find a therapist.,"I have been depressed for as long as I can remember (clearly remember being 5 at an event and thinking about what the point of living was - not a plan, just a conversation with myself about what life means and what we are supposed to be working towards) but functional. In the last few years, I have gotten myself to a place where I am just having anxiety attacks all the time, and am starting to get far less functional.

So I finally worked up the courage (I have thought about it ever since leaving for college and never was able to) to call a couple therapists to see if I could get in and... no one has space. Half of them have websites and half of those say ""now accepting new clients"" except they're not. I could just go down the list of everyone in my area and keep calling until I find someone available, but I know I will not feel comfortable with the vast majority so really what is the point? (Also, therapy over video or over the phone sounds like hell. I hate video calls and phone calls.)

Just wanted to point out that even finding a therapist requires a level of motivation and energy that I have not had in a long time."

inthzone,depression,1620442648.0,Why do people always say everything happens for a reason “except suicide”,"I noticed frequently when I watch videos that involve death that people always mention that death was that persons destiny. For instance I watch spiritual videos sometimes and they will say a spirit communicated that the timing was right. Directly after they say “except for cases of suicide”. Sorry but that makes no sense. If you have an urge to go driving and accidentally get in a car crash and die how is that different from the urge to go driving and crash because you purposely wanted to end your life? I personally don’t think it makes any sense that suicide death would be any different from anything else. I’m just a religious person trying to understand why things happen and I don’t see why suicide would be someone abandoning their destiny. If everyone has a set path , then they won’t leave that path."

I am asexual and aromatic, and don't want children, so I have no future there. My only avenue left was a fulfilling career, but I have started four different paths in the last 3 years, and dropped it each time, because I grow to hate it, and burn all of my bridges along the way. I'm about to drop my latest uni course, because when I started, I was full of hope and passion, but I hate it now, it's draining and unfulfilling, but the few people I have in my life are going to be so upset and disappointed when I tell them. And to live where I'm living, I need a full time course or job, those are the conditions. So, I have no hope for children, a partner or any domesticity, I have barely any people close to me, and those seem to be at the end of their tether dealing with me, I have no money, and no hope for any fulfillment in a career, because I'm lazy, unmotivated and drop everything I ever start. I'm a burden to those around me. I have no hope left, no direction, and to be honest, the only reason I'm still kicking now, no matter how small and stupid the reason seems, is because I would need to hire a skip for my junk, because I wouldn't burden my family with that, and I can't afford it. I don't really think there's words anyone can say to make it better, but I need hope and passion and instead just have guilt and purposlesness and nothing good. What do I do now?"

it's empty. i feel so fucking empty. i don't know what it feels like to not feel empty, i don't know what it's like to feel like myself because i don't know who i am. i'm unidentifiable, i don't know if i'm real, i don't know anything. 

that emptiness and lack of self-knowledge prompts me to attempt to fill in the gaps in any way i can. 

fill the void by eating, and receiving absolutely no pleasure out of what i am ingesting. i often make myself sick in the process. i can't explain how disgusting it is to feel your body wanting to reject the sheer amount of calories you're forcing into it. 

fill the void by starvation, sometimes eating well below 500 calories a day so i can feel physically empty, head hurting, the world hazy from self-induced restriction. the world feels a little safer then. i feel like i am worth a fuck. 

fill the void with alcohol, despite knowing that there is a fine line between where i feel like i am floating and i feel downright suicidal. alcohol is one of my best friends and one of my worst enemies. 

fill the void with xanax to distance myself from the social anxiety that has its clutches deep in my throat.

fill the void with ain't shit losers on dating apps that i know aren't good for my health, emotionally-speaking and physically-speaking as well. forget about the loneliness and rummage through banal conversations to find anything but what's going on in the confines of my skull. 

fill the void with my emotionally abusive ex, whom i invited back in my life in a moment of drunken weakness. i'm waiting for the pattern to begin again.

The past couple of weeks have been very stressful. Be it work (I work with my family), my physical health (disabled), uni work or my volunteer work with a community radio station.

It seemed to hit me all at once last week. I knew my anxiety was up because I was shaking and stammering all the time. But then things started looking different.

I'd be typing a message to a friend on my phone and it wouldn't look right then I'd suddenly think how amazing it was that I could type messages on a screen and then transport them for someone else to see... as if I hadn't ever done it before. Things looked as if they were in some kind of ""Super HD"" and I just didn't recognise or remember them. In reality, nothing had changed. It was all the same stuff I'd used thousands of times before.

But then came the actual visual hallucinations. Bugs everywhere. On the walls, the ceiling, my skin, everywhere. But they aren't there. This has happened before but not for a very long time. I've been pretty stable for the past 10 years or so.

I know I need to de-stress but I've never worked out how. Usually I'd just drug myself to sleep. I don't really want to go to my doctor and be put on the personality erasing drugs they put me on last time to stop the hallucinations.

I’ve had mental issues my whole life but ever since getting diagnosed with ADHD my life went downhill. Fast. I quit taking stimulant medication because I developed anti-social behavior & started smoking copious amounts of weed & isolated myself. Truth be told, ever since quitting these a year ago things have gotten very very bad. I dropped out of college my last year, had dpdr (maybe I still do & just live with it who knows), have VERY severe cognitive dysfunction, lost all of my friends, lost interest in anything, the list goes on & on. Now all that I do is obsess over what is wrong with me, be jealous 24/7 of people that are “normal”, google possible treatments & medications, go to work part-time as a bus boy (a miracle I am still employed as I literally do not/cannot talk to anyone), vape, and sleep. Not. A. Single. Thing. Else. Even if I wanted to do something else, I am trapped in my head no matter what I do. I am hopeless that this will be forever & that I will not achieve any of the things I wish to do/become.

This fucking sucks :))))

So here I am, looking for advice. 

Things I have tried
-Zoloft
-Abilify
-Vyvanse
-Concerta
-Fetzima (current)
-Latuda (current)
-Armodafinil (current)
-Ketamine IV (current but feel like giving it up since I am not the one paying for it nor has it provided any relief.

Things I am looking at:
-Nardil
-Parnate
-Anafranil/Clomipramine 


Living a life delusional w so much pain is very hard. So please please provide any anecdotal experiences/advice you have for me regarding these medications & if you were in a similar state of mind @ one point & were able to crawl out of it.

Thank you much love."

Well, my grandfather passed away a few weeks ago and now that the viewing and funeral mass is over, I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know who I am because he was an every day consideration for me.
I don't want to bother my family with any of this as they have their own grief. I just don't know what to do now.
Mainly, I just want to sleep until the pain goes away."

KrusktheVaquero,depression,1620549086.0,Why do I feel so empty?,"(Forgive formatting, on mobile)

Background: I have a kind of complex history with mental health. I've had a life long fight with depression, there were years where I just never felt any hope or affection from anyone. I thought I would just get killed when I got out of highschool, and that would be my end. I never even checked my SAT score, I figured I wouldn't need it. I also struggled with a lack of focus or direction in life. 

I recently entered a trade school for my dream job. I was so excited at first, I felt hope for the first time in a very long time. I felt so good that I started repairing my relationships in my family and started trying to unravel my issues. Now, about a year later, I feel really empty. Not in a ""oh my life is worthless"" kind of way like before, now its more like a total lack of passion. All that energy and drive I had at the start of trade school is gone. Don't get me wrong, I still love my career, but I just feel empty. 

I feel like I traded out my existential dread for apathy. Can I get any advice on how to get that passion back?"

It's been about a month since my depression has gone from manageable to ""struggle to get out of bed"" again. I am on Lexapro, Abilify and Prozosin (for PTSD nightmares).

Here are my dilemmas:

\- I am a teacher and well behind on my lesson plans for the week. Do I take tomorrow (Monday) off to get up to date and recover but miss out on human interaction?

\- No hobbies are bringing me joy and everything is exhausting me. What can I do to get some energy back?

\- My doctor has suggested changing my antidepressant. Do I go down this route or stick it out with Lexapro?

\- I am in counselling for PTSD twice a week and it's taking up a lot of time and mental energy. Do I suggest to my psychologist to slow down a bit or stick it out for another few weeks until the program finishes?

Any opinions are good! I am in my own head at the moment and need some external input."
Great-Consequence-98,depression,1620514782.0,Feel like my life is a waste. How do I get back on my feet? 34M,"I had such big dreams as a high school student. I wanted to change the world though sustainable energy.
Now all I want to to afford a house without mortgaging my life away and having some time to do the things I love. My decisions have gone to shit:

I loved the lifestyle of the town I lived in. It was great, good lifestyle, good uni, not a heap of jobs but ok. Houses were reasonable affordable.

I never bought a place because I wanted to make that decision with the person I married. Instead I saved a lot to be ready.  I accepted I lost a little bit keeping it in cash, but I wanted a house purchase to be a joint decision (And the transaction costs of buying and selling are quite high so you want it to be a long term decision). 

I felt I'd held off long enough and really wanted to buy. During coronavirus I worked hard and got a better more secure job. All the ""expert"" options was there would be a fall in house prices (in Australia). With such good savings & a safe job I was in a prime position, or so I thought. 

My plan was too buy and gradually start my own sustainability based company at a local business startup centre while still working.  

Unfortunately house prices have absolutely exploded. My more than my 11 years of hard savings feels a waste. In the area I wanted to buy they have increased by more than that. It feels like such a waste. I have no motivation anymore. So now for the money I could have got a nice house in a nice location gets me a shabby house in a bad location.

It's really affecting my mental health, I can't sleep at night & function during the day. 

I feel like my future went from being all set up to live in a great place and make a difference in the world without a big mortgage, to being shit and not worth it. 

Friends who didn't with as hard, earnt less, hardly saved at all but bought a property are doing so much better. 

Added to this is pressure of deciding a future with my girlfriend, and I know she sees the effect on me.

Basically:
I hate my new job
I hate the hours and commute  of my new job, no time for fun anymore
I'm unsure in my relationship
To buy a property I now need to mortage myself to the hilt, when one 1 year ago it was very affordable. Also the growth feels crazy and unsustainable so I worry about buying at the peak, but also I need my own place, I can't wait longer. I also feel I want to lock in my relationship before I do this. 

The pressure I feel is unbearable, all the while houses are still going up. Even right out of town in the country is hundreds of thousands of dollars more extensive now. And getting higher week by week.

I feel like just quitting, why work hard as an engineer. Doing productive work for the economy is not rewarded anywhere near as much as owning houses (unproductive assets). Australia is fucked!"

We are sleepwalking in a state of cognitive dissonance. No measure of mental gymnastics can justify how selfish the world has become. How we idolise capital and pursue profit regardless of the consequences. 

What are we without integrity? Without kindness? Without honesty? What are we in their absence? 

History will remember us as cowards. It will remember our silent subservience and collobaration with our masters.

Specialist_Note_7997,depression,1620579104.0,Life of depression,"I have been betrayed many times in my life.
It’s always the ones you let close to you and that’s what makes it hurt the most. When I was younger I used to see my dad abuse my mom. I used to tremble in my covers when they would fight. That’s when depression was introduced. Before I was 10 I began thinking about killing myself.

I found my mom when she overdosed on pills because she suspected my dad was cheating on her.She survived because I found her. Later My dad admitted to me that he was cheating. So her assumption was right.Ever since I have hated this life and world that I was given. There are so much more deserving people to be alive than me.

First betrayal was this girl in my neighborhood that I liked then eventually loved more than anything. After some years bf/gf she moved across town. That’s where it went bad. She was at a different school and met new friends. She started talking to a friend and eventually cheated on me with him. She ripped my heart out and stomped on it. So me being dumb convinced her to stay with me and try to have a baby. We were in our teens still in high school. So it was not a smart choice. Luckily she didn’t get pregnant. I ended up walking away with no feeling for her. She eventually regretted what she had done and begged me to take her back. I didn’t. I went out with three more girls after. But not getting to close to them. I was young and good looking. I had confidence.
I started my first job when I was sixteen and a year later seen this beautiful girl at the time clock. I will never forget that moment. Her smile would instantly bring happiness to anyone she smiled at.
But she had a boyfriend but I still wished she was mine. I didn’t have confidence then and became introverted. I would never have courage to talk to her. She eventually broke up with her boyfriend and was dating a lot.
My friend told her I wanted to talk to her. So she approached me and we starting talking.
This made me happy. But I still had scars from the first betrayal so I kept my distance.
We started being bf/gf. She was the best thing to happen to me. This gorgeous girl was interested in me. It was unbelievable.
So after a few months I get a call from one of her friends and he says that she’s riding around with him to trying to hook up with his friend. This friend is the guy that my previous girlfriend cheated on me with.
So I learned my lesson and called her at work. Told her I wanted to break up because I wasn’t going to be hurt like that again. She rushed to my house and convinced me not to break up with her.
That should of been it if I stuck to my original thought of just breaking up with her.
There was other instances that made me doubt her being faithful to me but I just brushed it  because  she was so beautiful and wanted to be with Me.
So we were together 3 years then got married in 2000. Those three years were filled with suspicion of her cheating. So the next three years I still had suspicions. I got so distraught with the thought of it that I bought some sleeping pills to make me sleep and not waking up. I didn’t want to feel that pain again. But we got through it.
After three years of marriage she wanted a baby but I was reluctant because I didn’t know if this was going to last. I was real depressed then and didn’t want to be here anymore. Well she got pregnant and we had my son which gave me new reason to live. I couldn’t leave him fatherless.He is the first good thing in my life. My first born. My first unconditional love. My son. So three more years go by and I having suspicions of her again. So like the first betrayal I decided let’s have another baby. Thinking it would make things better. So we had my daughter which was another great thing to happen in my life. She is my princess. Always will be.
So our relationship improved. The next 12 years were filled with ups and down. Suspicions were always there from beginning. So in 2018 she moves to a different work location and we are no longer working in same building. Has new friends who are not so loyal to their husbands. But to me she isn’t like them so why have friends like that. So she goes on a trip with them and things with never be the same.
Before the trip she was constantly on snap.
A lot of guys were on her snap. So she came back from her trip and I just feel like something is not right. So four days after trip I noticed she was snapping some guy.
She tried to tell me it was nothing. I got mad and told her to delete the app. She wouldn’t do it. Day later she comes and show me that she deleted him. But I knew better. So days later we are drinking having a good time. I bought her roses. The whole time she snapping right next to me.
So after having a good time she goes to take a shower. I pick up her phone and it auto fills her password on snap. I seen she had someone name as “My Baby”. It instantly made me crumble. I couldn’t believe it. I asked her about it and she had a o shit face. She said it was nobody. I flipped and told her I was leaving her. She was pleading for me not to leave her. I took off and was driving after taking out a bottle of tequila. I wanted to kill myself.This was the ultimate betrayal. So I went back home.
She was trying to sweet talk me and tell me it was nothing. But how can you call someone my baby and it’s nothing.
So next day I just can’t handle it and take bottle of sleeping pills. So I get put in a mental hospital for a week. She visits and says she hasn’t been on snap. I was at peace in there. No thoughts. No worries.
So I get out and find out she has been on snap. This is third lie. So she makes me go to a therapist to work on me. Because it’s my fault she was talking to another guy.
So I clamped down. No more hanging out with those immoral friends. No more snap.
She does it. The last four years I am on edge. Worrying about her doing this again.
I am not at peace. So I see different things that don’t look right. I ask her and she has explanation but no proof of what she was doing. So presently I noticed she gets a lot of texts and calls from a guy at work. I ask her and she says he just a friend that’s needing help. But all these calls are when I am not with her. So I suspect it’s something else. I text guy and ask him and he says it’s nothing. It stopped so I thought. Then found wife has a another phone that she’s been using to talk to him. I catch her in more lies. 
She won’t admit it. I have proof and she still won’t admit it. After almost  24 year together this is how it ends. With lies and deceit. I am hurt.betrayed. Devastated.crushed. That she did this to me. I again am wanting not to be here anymore. I really was going to kill myself yesterday to rid of this pain.  My son found me in tears. I told him I wanted to die. He said I couldn’t because he would do the same. I promised I wouldn’t hurt myself.
The thought has always been there. This life I was given has been hell. The girl I met 23 years is someone else. I just don’t understand it. Her straight face lies.
This is my depression and my sorrow.
If you read all this I thank you. This is my story,my pain and My heart bleeding out with all these words. 
My Love for her has now turned to HATE!!!"

He gave no reaction nothing he didn’t flinch he didn’t move he didn’t say anything to comfort me. I think he may be cheating but that’s based off a gut feeling and how he’s sneakier, less affectionate, less caring. Lately it’s been work home eat games sleep. I don’t get a place in his life I can literally sit and watch him play games for two hours without any attention coming from him. Conversation are one word at a time from him with no effort for anything in the relationship. If I leave I lose the only thing I have and I will kill myself but im asking for help and he doesn’t care."

I don’t know what I want to do after college when I graduate. I don’t know what I want to do a year from now or tomorrow or even today. I want to vomit from all the pressure I feel and how hopeless it feels.

I’m finding myself crying constantly, over things that might seem small but are really just causing the bigger things to come through. I never thought I was suicidal, but I don’t think it’s normal to think about how it would be better if you didn’t exist. That maybe all the things you’re feeling would go away if that happened. I don’t know if I would ever do it, I’d be too ashamed of the pain I’d leave my mother in. But how does one overcome this kind of sadness? I have absolutely no feeling toward anyone really, like I try to, but the people I truly care about have hurt me so much and don’t reciprocate the same care, so I’ve just shut myself off emotionally toward them. Because of that I’m so lonely, I don’t have anyone to turn to. I’m utterly miserable and sad and I only have my dog. I feel like a loser most of the time, my life is not at all what it was supposed to be, what I tried to make it be. I feel like it’s partially my fault, but I also know most of it was out of my hands and life happened to me in the worst way. I’m so depressed about so many things and I don’t even know where to began to stop feeling like this. How do I get happy, how do I get not depressed? I didn’t used to be this way, I had hope, joy for the future and just life in general. Now that I’ve completely lost it I don’t know how to get it back. When I see someone happy it’s like foreign to me, I don’t even know what that could possibly be like and I look at them with complete confusion."
pkchu94,depression,1620539307.0,Emotionally Drained and Overwhelmed,"Tried to make an excuse to reschedule my belated birthday gathering because I was emotionally unwell didn't go so well. I was still kind of forced to come out and was screaming inside the entire time because I no longer felt I was capable of being present to enjoy my time with friends. Feeling like I was getting fingers pointed at me for possibly overreacting at trying to work around everyone's schedule and making me feel like I'm being inconsiderate of people's time and circumstances made me feel worse when I had intended the exact opposite.

Having a guy friend aggressively say that my time should only revolve around the time that I make with him and no one else's-- felt hostile and alarming to me when I told him that I can't guarantee but I will try to make time. The excuse that it was a joke felt off putting and felt like he was gas lighting me when he tried to turn things around after pointing it out. The text message exchange reminded me of recurring memories of my ex boyfriend and it certainly didn't make me feel good. It made things weird when he sent me a reel with a quote revolving around, ""what are we,"" after what had happened and when we are only friends.

A situation where I witnessed a creep trying to use suicide as an excuse to try to get close to a girl triggered my emotions as hearing him say that she was being dramatic. It made me feel invalidated of my emotions and thoughts although it had nothing to do with me. Breaking down in a restroom stall and questioning my current emotions made me feel even more overwhelmed.

The thought of gathering more people for a mountain hike scares me as I don't want to put myself in another stressful situation like my belated birthday gathering. The general thought of a social gathering is now also scaring me and I'm starting to lose interest in the plans that I was looking forward to in the next couple of months.

I want to shut out from the world right now and detox from any social interaction for a while and I don't want to lash out on anyone due to my emotions. But I also don't want people to bug me and ask me if I'm okay and to talk about it because I know that they won't understand how I'm feeling."

I know memory loss can be an effect of Depression, but mine seems abnormally bad. I literally cannot remember anything from my childhood. I can remember a few of my old friends names and the school I went to, but I can't picture them, or anything we did.

I know that certain things happened (what we used to play, my old address, a couple instances of me being bullied etc) but I cannot picture them, or remember them aside from a few general points (the way we used to play fairies, my old Street name etc).

Even now, I can't remember what I did last year properly, or specific dates of events I know happened in recent years.

I was just wondering how extensive the memory loss can be, because it's making me feel so, I dunno, empty, weird, lost.

Any advice would be appreciated greatly."

zoedanielleb,depression,1620624132.0,I have a nagging feeling of discontentment with where I am in life and it scares me.,"(F19) I’ve had depressive episodes since I was 13, but for many years they only happened around Christmas break and I knew it would get back to normal once I went back to school. Then in 2019 I was hit with a bad spell of insomnia that threw me into a nervous breakdown and I haven’t been truly normal since. The next school year, I’d feel completely content and normal at school, then everyday when I got home I’d be overwhelmed with sadness. That went away eventually and I went back to normal, then COVID hit and my sleep got super messed up again which threw me into another nervous breakdown. I got depressed again but eventually it got back to normal and I was happy for a while. Then fall and winter hit and my seasonal depression started up again. I just felt like there was a weight bringing me down, a quiet discontentment with where I was in my life. I don’t know what it is, but the feeling just kills my joy and calm. I went on medication for it, and then developed OCD which drove me crazy for a few months. I’ve leveled out but still have a feeling like there’s something wrong with me or my life and I don’t know what it is and that scares me. I’ve been in therapy but I don’t think it’s helped with this persistent feeling. Maybe I should up my medication? I’m only 5mg of Lexapro so it’s probably not doing too much for me. I just wanted to know if it was something genuinely wrong with my life that’s causing this feeling or just a chemical imbalance in my brain. I just hate feeling like this. It scares me that I don’t know what’s wrong and it feels like I’ve tried working on my mental health but this just hasn’t changed."
ausername-,depression,1620580759.0,I've always felt so unwanted.,"I've been awake for a little while and I've just been laying here, stewing in depressing thoughts. I got caught up in a pretty bad memory from around 8 or 9 months ago. I was laying in bed with my (at the time) fiance and we were supposed to have a little movie date where we watched stuff together (we were long distance for the first year of our relationship and so these movie dates were very special to us, they're how we initially bonded), and she was just on her phone the whole time (with whom I'd later found out she'd been cheating on me with, and whom she would ultimately end up leaving me for) unaware of my existence. This had become commonplace and it was very distressing for me.

I ended up getting out of bed to go hug our puppy and afterwards I just laid on the floor for a while. It took her ten or twenty minutes to even realize I was out of bed. I was crying quietly. She hugged me and held me for a while and that was nice, but when we got up and got back in bed, she was immediately glued to her phone and oblivious to my existence again. I felt so unwanted.

I've pretty much always felt unwanted. By everybody, all of the time. By friends and family, by the few romantic partners I've ever had. I always feel like a burden, as though my presence is an imposition. Most people often have irritated or outright hostile reactions to my presence - like my mere existence is offensive to them. It's so hard to deal with.

I just wish there was someone excited at the prospect of my existence, someone who reveled in time shared with me. It's so painful to be so unwanted."

gildedpotus,depression,1620528577.0,Suicidal thoughts that I don’t want?,"It’s been a very rocky several months. Covid, lost my first real job, meds that didn’t agree with me, etc.

Idk what my real problem is. For a while I thought meds made me numb, but either that’s worn off or the problem is just my depression got a lot worse. Lately I deal with crying spells. And I feel it coming on and know it’s going to be tough for a while. Often times crying to family helps, or even just talking to people on discord.

The thing is I think my life has been getting better. I’m working. I feel less dpdr. I have been able to play video games and talk with friends on discord (I thought I was too messed up to seem like my normal self). 

But these thoughts of suicide (nothing specific, just like “will you do this?”) and the general replaying of my life situation is near constant and it’s exhausting. I think it’s obsessive in nature. And I’ve had some times where it went away during playing games or just at times getting lost in an activity. It’s rare tho, and I worry that no matter what I’m always going to have these thoughts about how I’ve lost my old self and one day I may end up ending it all. It brings me to tears to write this. I couldn’t do this to myself or my family. But I’m worried the pressure from it will one day get to me. 

Life has been very weird lately. Especially these last couple days, I don’t know if I’m getting better or not. I was feeling good for a while, but then I felt worse and I wonder if my progress is just “tricking myself” or “pretending”. I just wonder if anyone has dealt with this kind of confusion and unwanted thoughts."

My partner kind of makes me feel worse, I don’t really want to break up but I often wonder if my mental health is becoming worse while in a relationship. I wonder how he feels as well and if we feel the same at times. There’s a handful of situations but for example: 
When I’m depressed I just want to listen to music with earbuds, so I do and for example, I look up and he shakes his head at me and gives me a disappointed look on purpose, 
I’ve asked him to stop manyyy times to stop shaking his head while looking at me because it makes me feel like I did something wrong and frustrated. He doesn’t really say anything at all when i ask him why he’s doing that. Idk I feel like shit I feel even more alone because who wants to share a room with someone who likes to stare down on them and shake their head while they already feel down.

When I say it feels like anxiety has ruined my life and my brain, I mean it. I can't even see it when it's there or where it's coming from, because it's everywhere, and I can't see. It has destroyed all my clarity. I feel just so fucking hopeless. I feel like it's not even this creature on my shoulder where I still know who I am or I'm still mostly functioning, it's like it has eaten my brain and destroyed the way I think and behave, like my whole like is one giant bad coping mechanism. I don't know where to begin if I never have clarity. My personality is there, but it's underneath all of this fog. I can't be myself normally because it is always tensing me up and turning my attention back to myself and my brain, causing worry that I have spent years repressing because otherwise it was too overwhelming. I can't even feel properly depressed anymore cause it's like my emotions are in a lock and my brain/thoughts/emotions can move freely and naturally. I need to know there is a way out of this. The thing I think might help but won't be able to get for at least a little while, probably not till next semester is anxiety medication, and hopefully *hopefully* that'll release my brain from some of the tension and I can get more clarity and start to feel real again. But I don't know if that'll work, and I don't want to put all my hopes in that. Not really sure what else to do or if there are things that help people."

Lately I feel like it may be worst because I am now feeling like I wish I was dead. However, suicide is not something I'd \*ever\* do. I am very much of the thought process that I'd rather live in pain than not at all and that life is valuable and worth living. So I am not sure why these thoughts keep on popping into my head and why I am feeling this way. I do see a therapist, but I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and able to work through it without medication. I just want to feel I am not alone.

tiffhasknees,depression,1620600821.0,Life keeps pushing me down,"I haven't really made a post like this before, but I seriously need to vent. I moved out of my mom's at age 17 into my great grandfather's home because I didn't like how I was being treated by an individual in my mom's home. That was a really rough time because I had also being suffering from possibly a psychotic break due to my severe OCD and anxiety. I left on a whim late one night with nothing but the clothes on my back and that was my last day living there. I had no money because I have been having to pay for a lot of my own stuff since I was 15 and also tend to shop a lot because I feel it will make me feel better. I was able to get all of my belongings about a month later, but that wasn't the end of this nightmare. As soon as I was to turn 18, I had to start paying for all of my own stuff and was forced into adulthood and back to work while I was still intensely sick. This caused me to miss multiple days of work and ended in a termination. I had been there for 2 years. After getting fired, I decided to take the time to figure myself out and practice some self care. Living in my great grandfather's basement was NOT the best, but I decided to give it a deep clean to make it my own. My mattress was directly on the basement floor because I didn't have a frame, and when I lifted it to clean the floor underneath I discovered mold. We decided it was coming from the walls and proceeded to rip the walls out. To make sure I didn't have mold in my foam mattress, we removed the top cover and a cheese like netting around the mattress to inspect it. Turns out, this netting was made almost entirely of fiberglass. Fiberglass got embedded into everything I own. I had to sell my truck to afford a new mattress because the old one was coated in glass. My clothes still have shards in them to this day. Now, the new vehicle I got is in need of new tires and something is out of wack with the engine. I am trying to get a job but it's hard when my depression makes me want to just lay down and die. I did just get food stamps so at least theres that.

This whole experience has been completely overwhelming and it just seems to be one thing after another. Shortly after moving out I fell into a deep depression and I'm just wondering if life will always be this way? 

TL;DR
After moving out at 17, my life has been going down hill fast and I need some hope for the future lol"

It’s in giving happiness that makes me happy because I know what it’s like to feel alone and cold. Physically cold. The thought of just how aimless and alone I am gives me full body shivers and chills. I don’t want other people to feel like me, so I want to make them happy. My ex girlfriend, my ex ultimately because of my gender, told me that I’m too pure for this world. I feel so lonely even when I’m not alone because my best friend used to be even so much more to me, and we can’t have that anymore because of how I fucking feel about wanting to be having tits on my chest or the hormonal balance of a woman.

I cut ties and relationships because I can never feel good enough and I might as well end it early because I know for sure that I'm a waste of time. I doubt people's intentions and have trust issues because I've learned that even someone who tells you that they love you so much can act like they really want to hurt you. I sometimes feel like such a cold person who cant express emotions normally because whenever I cried I was ""such a pain"" or ""too sensitive and dramatic.""

I may have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia; in fact the whole thing was shady to me from the start. I’d say 50/50 chance but pretty shady. 

Knowing what I know, I have no reason to change the dose of antipsychotics I’m currently on. They all disable me and make me suicidal and there’s no need for them because I don’t have delusions. And no the brain fog doesn’t go away in time. This is an undocumented truth. AP’s make your mood worse unless maybe you have delusions, trouble sleeping, or violent schizophrenia related hallucinations which I don’t. 

I’m upping my Effexor just a little but that’s just because of how desperate I am. 

My stressors are:
People (everyone)
My mother
My neighbors
The city I live in cause it’s where I’ve lived all my life since 4
Having to leave my apartment and deal with people to shop for necessities
Not knowing what to do given antipsychotics and antidepressants haven’t worked out
Knowing I’ll have to work again someday and that means having to deal with people
Not knowing my I.Q.

What I want to do is figure out if I have PTSD, especially if I have PTSD related to my childhood or other people. I’m not upping any medication except for Effexor. 

I believe I’ve been a victim of sadism, but I’m not sure what happened exactly. I’m gonna have to document heavily to find out if that’s the case.

When it comes to people I don’t know if I exposure helps or if the whole idea is just wish fulfillment.

Basically I think I’m gonna be depressed for a very long time, but if I can get rid of some of my stressors, then the fact of being depressed will be easier to deal with.

Most of all, I need somebody who’s gonna keep me from making bad decisions that are gonna screw up my life.

I need suggestions. Everything you need to know is in the title. Thank you."
Low-Objective-6864,depression,1620505069.0,Just feel like every time I try to be positive I am slammed back to reality and I will always be depressed because my life is depressing.,"I have two young kiddos with special needs. The one with the most disability was diagnosed with Down syndrome shortly after birth. I grieved the loss of the daughter I thought I was going to have, but for her sake tried to get over it and focus on why everyone reassured me, how high functioning people with Down syndrome can be. Everyone floods you in the beginning with positivity and support and great stories about high functioning people with Ds. And over the next weeks, months and years my hopes have one by one been crushed. Every new medical problem is another disappointment that she will ha e to deal with and most likely shorten her lifespan and quality of life. 
Now i have her teachers and school therapists telling me at age 7 she doesn’t belong in the regular school, where her brother goes, and they keep pushing her into a “life skills” class in another town. Meanwhile she has never had a full school day anywhere, and they are writing her off at the age of 7 and all their reasoning has to do with their convenience. I read up and ALL the evidence overwhelming
Fly supports inclusion in regular classes as best for all but the 1% at the lowest functioning level. And it’s better for the special Ed student and their typical peers. 
My husband thinks I am the one overreacting and maybe they are right. Which just makes me want to give the fuck up. If I didn’t know losing me would hurt my kids so much, I would have already killed myself. My poor son has severe anxiety and ocd and I am 100% sure the anxiety is from having such a depressed and anxious mom. I am probably fucking them up for life whether I live or die. 
Life fucking sucks and it’s an illusion that it gets better. Sometimes I lie to myself to act normal and happy, or forget how much it sucks temporarily,  but it never really gets better in any important ways."

Oopy-soup,depression,1620542547.0,Need this out of my system.,"I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I don't feel comfortable in my own mind. I feel so insignificant and little, I know that's not true but it's how I feel. I constantly battle these dark thoughts and I feel like I have to fight them silently because people don't know what to say or do to help or they're tired of talking to me about it.


I knew this kid who killed himself right after we graduated high school and I think about all the things he missed out on since 2003. I remember his mom blaming him for what he did and his inability to overcome his struggles even with therapy and medications. Another friend of mine told me the day of the funeral that what he did was a selfish act. They both blamed him.



I've done what I thought I've needed to do, I've gotten therapy and medications but they don't seem to have helped these thoughts fade away. I think about killing myself more than I should. I think about my son, how he might feel, how awful he'd feel, the tears he's shed. I think about my infant daughter, growing up without a father. I think of my wife, angry with me for giving up, angry for leaving her, angry for anything bad that would happen to the family caused by my suicide. They're the only things keeping me here. 


I'm at a loss, I don't know how to keep moving on and get over this. It's been like this for about three years. It ebbs and flows but it's always there, the dark thoughts."

I live in a neighborhood where you come in contact with people almost everytime you step out to take the trash, pick up mail etc. i haven't been able to do either of those in months, because i fear that people judge me because i'm at home nearly around the clock everyday and ask me about it.
Sorta feeling like im a failure among people who live a stable life around me? Talking with people, getting groceries and doing normal stuff i was able to do before with ease seems like a heavy task to do now too.

I used to be social and outgoing, but the latest episode really made me crawl into my shell.

bennyjettz,depression,1620518028.0,Ongoing Nighttime Depression,"For sometime when I was a child, I experienced severe nighttime depression after the loss of a family member. When going to bed I would be unable to sleep and stay awake endless hours feeling isolated and hopeless. My mother always left the radio on to help us kids sleep, but to this day there are songs that were popular then that trigger me immediately now even 20 years later. I don't exactly remember it getting better, but I do know that it lasted for sometime around a year I believe. Fast forward to present day and yes there are times when I struggle and have been on different medications that don't seem to help, but have always told myself I could handle it independently. That is not the case. My husband and I recently bought our first home and boom all of the sudden the nighttime depression is back in full swing. We have lived several different places before and this never has seemed to impact me, but something now is causing a comeback. I will be fine and feel happy and hopeful during the day, but usually around 4p-5p is when it slowly starts to creep back up. I have an appointment with my doctor to talk about possible medications, but I'm mainly on here looking for suggestions and aid in additional relief and tips on how to help when facing the night everyday. I want to feel happy and comfortable in my home, but I find myself constantly trying to figure out a way to get out and back to a place that I didn't have these feelings. My husband has been completely supportive and understanding through this, but it has only been a month and I want to sell, and I don't want to have to go to that extreme. I'm just afraid that even if I do overcome this, will the house forever be tainted to me? Just wanting help and hopefully some guidance to get rid of that sinking and crushed feeling in my chest."

RosellaSwan9,depression,1620586588.0,I'm tired of living,It's really hard to go on living each day as though everything is fine and I'm not dying inside. Parents think it's just a phase or that I have anger issues cause I'm doing bad things or feel guilty. It's b***s***. I can't even tell them cause they'll be like you'll get through it. It's just the way of life or you're fine or don't be dramatic. I absolutely hate it. I'm a real person and I have feelings too. Why don't you get that? Its really hard to pretend to be happy cause if I'm not I'm accused of ruining everyone else's mood or trying to get my way by ruining the day. And then when I'm asked if I have friends or can't say no I don't so I just nod my head but actually whenever I try to make friends it just doesn't work. If someone asks me to come walk with them or play badminton I happily get up and go but on the way they ditch me and I wait for minutes to see if they come back but they don't. No one ever does. And then they have the audacity to actually ask me why are you sitting alone? Why are you so quiet? And when I talk the again they have something to complain about like why are you so hyper? Can you shut up I'm trying to talk? And I hate that. I feel like there's something wrong with me that's why I don't fit in. I just want someone who likes me for who I am and doesn't try to change me and actually gets me. Life is s***. Won't complain if it's over.

Im irrational. Emotional. Illogical and this will destroy my relationship if I don't fix it now.

kittykatr427,depression,1620436737.0,I had forgotten what it felt like to NOT want to die,"I(25F) have struggled with suicidal thoughts and major depression since high school. The past year was really tough, and I thought about suicide almost constantly. There was a string of really messy relationship drama and I felt like I was losing everything. I have recently come to accept it and realize that I was never really happy with him, I just thought I was because I hadn't been happy without him, either. I had a lot of family and friends help me out in the toughest moments, and luckily no permanent harm was done.

This past week I was driving around and I realized that I hadn't thought about killing myself or dying in months. Prior to this I hadn't gone more than a few days without wanting to die, and I can't remember ever wanting to live in the past 8 years. I was able to think about suicide and immediately go into that headspace; I knew why I wanted it, how much I wanted it, and at a moment's notice I could feel the suicidal pull. I could immediately empathize with other depressed or suicidal people. But now I feel like I couldn't even feel that depressed if I wanted to. It's like those thoughts are out of reach.

My ex was telling me about how his mistress mentioned thinking she'd be better off dead once or twice after he broke things off with her, and I responded that if I only think that twice a day then it's a rare, good day. To me, every day would inevitably bring thoughts that death would be a sweet release, and I couldn't even see how for others those thoughts would be concerning. And I was so used to the constant nagging thoughts of death that I wasn't even aware of how unhealthy it was.

When I realized I had stopped feeling that way, it was like I could see a whole other world. It hasn't drastically changed my outlook, more like little things I changed have led to me not feeling that way. I feel like I can now see ""how the other half lives"" and understand how hard it is for someone who has never experienced depression or suicidal thoughts to get how it feels."

I thought the whole point was to tell her to get better, not make me feel worse and have me get punished. ""Oh you having intense suicidal thoughts, well time out for you!""

My friend started cutting again, and can't tell his therapist for the same reasons. It's starting to feel like a waste. No one wants to be known as the guy who got put in a psych ward.

Tranquilizingasmr,depression,1620470791.0,Constantly depressed due to financial struggles and living hand to mouth.,"The past few years haven't really been to kind to my family and I. Father hasn't worked since 2020 mainly due to covid. My mother and I are the only ones earning but unfortunately all her money is always immediately deducted as soon as it comes in since she is trying to pay off my father's debt. So that leaves me to constantly pay all the bills and buy groceries in the house. I don't make enough money at all, but I am trying to change that and get more clients. I am writing proposals left and right on Upwork to get more jobs. I wish I could invest money into my business but due to the situation in the house I just never have anything left over. Life is just really hard right now. I am always thinking about our next meal and money. I am praying I get more work soon because I really need it. Since I haven't gotten paid yet I won't be able to buy groceries tomorrow until next week Thursday, so the next few days will be very tough, but we have learned to survive on water from time to time. Living hand to mouth everyday is really upsetting and I don't wish this sort of life on anyone.  I completely understand that many people aren't doing well financially since covid begun so naturally alot of people are depressed and I have no right to complain as I am sure many people have it harder than me. I just want a way to cope with this. Maybe someone to talk to from this subreddit. I know what the root cause of my depression is, and I am working on bettering the lives of my brother, mother, father and aunt. I just want to talk or even hear some stories from people in this subreddit how they have coped with their depression during this whole pandemic. Thanks for reading and have a blessed day."
angelmilk17,depression,1620603162.0,Depressive episode may be the end for me,"(Also posted on suicidewatch)
I’m so exhausted. I grew up fundamentalist, and my narcissist mom made me hate myself for who I am and what I like. Constantly making me feel like shit. Tried to escape to college and be a “good Christian” by going to a Christian college. Realized I am pansexual and an atheist and tried to kms. Didnt work, switched schools and got diagnosed with OCD and bipolar type 1. Somehow graduated with a degree I don’t care about and started getting my masters because I didn’t know what else to do. Started dating a guy who made two different dating profiles and reached out to escorts behind my back. Got so depressed I’m failing school. My job that pays for school doesn’t have enough funds to keep me on board for the summer. Boyfriend keeps trying to convince me he has changed and I mean something to him but everyone in my life has betrayed me and I know I don’t matter to any of them unless I’m right in front of them and can serve them somehow. I am broke as shit and depend on my bf. I don’t see a way out of any of it, and I’m too tired to keep going. I can’t see my counselor because they were at the school and I can’t attend for the summer. I can’t do this. I’m too ugly and undesirable and stupid and bad at shit for this world. I don’t even know how I found the energy to type this or why I even bother. Feel like I’m already dead and frankly wish I was. Called my mom for Mother’s Day and she was crying and is disappointed in me. My bf doesn’t want to be around me and just guilted me for eating to much of our groceries even though I’m recovering from an ED so that’s hella triggering. I’m a fucking burden and I want out

TLDR: not good enough for family, school, bf, or ‘god’ and don’t think I can do this whole living thing much longer."
1_pasta_1,depression,1620549232.0,I hate the fact that you have to wait until you're 25-30 to finally get help,"I have had depression since I was 7-10 years old and I always wanted to have someone to help me deal with it, I got to post on facebook at that age that I wanted to commit suicide, many people responded to that post and my parents forced me to delete it and hit me Without asking myself the reason why I did that (bullying, domestic violence, etc.) and since then I decided to completely hide my depression and now 9 years later and a suicide attempt I don't think I can bear another 6 years to finally disappear completely, go to therapy and completely rebuild my life. Well, the only thing that motivates me not to commit suicide (again) is that my younger sister also has depression and that strangers from the internet that I will never know support me to continue alive

edit: Why the title? Why wait until you are 25?

Many of us cannot just go to therapy or tell someone ""hey I have depression and I need professional help"" (without ending up receiving the same empty and stupid words ""you don't need therapy"" ""you are not depressed you are just lazy"", etc) or go for Itself, since the main factors are not having money, not having a means of transportation and / or being in a toxic environment, so you have to wait at that age to live alone and finally repair all the damage that you have been accumulating"
Purdybranch1,depression,1620613194.0,It’s worse than ever,"When I (F21) was 15 (2015) I was diagnosed with depression after trying to end my life. I got the help I needed and got better. A couple years ago I stopped going to therapy and weaned myself off my meds. Don’t get me wrong, I still have my days/weeks but I have done amazing things since then and I’m so proud of myself and how far I’ve come. 

Recently, those bad days/weeks turned into months. Since January I have been on an downwards spiral and I think I’ve hit rock bottom.

January: It started off by being overworked (60 hour weeks on my feet the entire time). I told my boss multiple times I couldn’t do these hours anymore as I was too tired and my body couldn’t handle it. She told me to drink some coffee and deal with it. That went on for 2 months before I mustered up the courage to quit. 

March: I had a good week after that and then I was right back to being depressed. My boyfriend, who I live with, told me he didn’t think he could handle being there for me once he starts school in the fall along with work. I applied to 30 jobs over the next month with no calls back. 

April: I had the idea to start a reselling business. I really enjoyed it but it hardly brought in the profit I wanted. My boyfriend brings up not being able to be there for me again and I gave him the opportunity to end things. He said he didn’t want to and sees a future with me. I was happy he wanted that. An old coworker texts me saying her mom wanted me to come work for her and I started immediately. I’m doing great at this point, things are looking up!

The night before my first day my boyfriend was acting weird. I was overthinking and searched his phone(something I’ve never done before, I just had a feeling). I found nudes of one of his coworkers. He said she sent those out of nowhere and he didn’t want to make things at work weird so he didn’t block her or acknowledge them. He begged me not to leave him and apologized profusely.

May: I’ve been struggling horribly since then with trust issues. I looked through his phone again and found flirty texts with a different coworker that seemed inappropriate to me but he insisted they were innocent. He’s visiting his dying grandfather in a different state this weekend so I have the house to myself.

I’ve enjoyed the time to process everything and figure out how I feel but now I’ve never felt more alone in my life. I’m absolutely heartbroken and all I want is to be held and comforted while I cry and I have no one. I reached out to a friend who’s always been there but it didn’t help. All I want is my boyfriend. Before all this we had an amazing relationship and he’s been my rock for so long. He doesn’t come home for a couple more days and I don’t think I can make it.

The only thing I have going for me anymore is this job. I know I need help again but I don’t know how to get it."

BlueBerryMiAmor,depression,1620443861.0,Need Some Input on Citalopram,"Background: early 30s, patterns of binge drinking, have always had trouble sleeping, but not what I would consider depression. Love exercising, very social, and throughly enjoy my job.

So I went to my primary care physician recently for my annual checkup/bloodwork. All was fine. I do say when I drink heavily, the nights following make it very, very difficult to fall asleep at a reasonable time. Melatonin doesn't really help: usually I can fall asleep but wake up about an hour later. 

We discussed some medications and he suggested citalopram. Had never heard of it and he said he sees it as an '3-in-one' type medication: for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I can be anxious at times (alcohol certainly doesn't help), but have never seen myself as depressed or experiencing depression.

Thoughts on this drug for what I've described? Very weary of taking meds in general, and idk, this one just doesn't seem right for me. 

All responses are appreciated. Cheers :)"

kmixo,depression,1620549821.0,Masking Depression,"I've had depression for as long as I can remember. I wasn't officially diagnosed until after my first daughter was born and I had a terrible panic attack the day I brought her home. She was crying. She was my first baby so it didn't really kick in that I was really a mom until I found myself not really knowing what to do. I had a full on panic attack. My husband watched me and consoled us both. I had PPD. I was crying often, feeling useless, becoming nagging, I shut people out, stoped being interested in things I use to love, and eventually become an angry person. When she was about a year and a half, i started going to college, got a discount for Weems, and made an appointment. School started getting tough and with a toddler and family at home, I needed to talk to someone. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My relationship was starting to melt under pressure,  but we survived. I was put on different antidepressants, however, I felt Medications were not working so I stopped taking them. A few years later, I got pregnant again. I graduated which was a huge relief and  after having my second daughter, I almost felt I was somewhat normal again. I'm not sure if it was caused by a hormonal shift or what, but it was like a light bulb went off. I almost felt calm and wasn't upset for a while. I have tried to be brave and not so angry. Today, however, I am feeling weepy and still shut off from the world. I hate being around other people. I feel like they judge me because I've gained so much weight the past several years. I don't want to talk to anyone except my husband. He's been so supportive of me and understanding. I think I'm ready to get back on Prozac and sleeping Medications. I need help, I know I do."

kem343,depression,1620590251.0,No more silence,"Hey everyone. I’m writing this on Mother’s Day so Happy Mother’s Day to all the mommas! 

Before I share my story I want to warn some people that it is very disturbing, and violent so if you have a weak heart or underage don’t read. 

Growing up I was very shy, I later realized it was social anxiety; but was always very polite and sweet. The abuse started when I was 4, my cousin was around 14 at the time and he always touched me in weird ways. He would ask me if I felt good. I felt uncomfortable but he started to tell me that he loves me and not to tell anyone or else they would hurt me. 

It escalated and he and his brother AND their friends would touch me. Sometimes they would put their finger in me so hard that I would cry and they would hold my mouth, tell me they were sorry and give me a lollipop.  I’m not sure how but eventually the parents found out. They cried and held me and told my mother, somehow my older brother heard and got into a huge fight with our cousin which resulted to police coming over. Never seen each spoke to that family again. 

I would like to say that is the end of that but 5 more of my relatives abused me repeatedly from age 4-13. I ended up telling my brother because I trusted him and he asked me how they touched me and ended up doing the same when mom I want around. My brother is 8 years older then me and eventually 4 of his friends started to touch me and hurt me as well. They would say “I heard your brother put his finger inside, did you like it”. They would touch me behind his back and infront of him. He didn’t care about me.

This part is the worst. When I was 11 I was walking home from school and was passing one of my brothers friends house. He seen me and told me that he wanted to show me something so I went inside. He told me to get on the bed and lay down. Touched me a little bit and actually put his private part in slowly. I screamed and started to cry and his mom was just coming in and I will never forget the face of shock she had. She started screaming, crying and hitting him. She called him disgusting and told me she was so sorry. She asked me if I could keep this a secret and ofc I said yes. They believed me because I never spoke. 

I could go on for days about how many times I’ve been touched. I tried to kill myself I prayed to god to make an accident happen to me. I’m 25 years old with no relationship to my family, I know they remember and they don’t want to see me. Around 30 people have hurt me when I was a kid and my mother has never actually talked to me about it. Mothers, fathers, caregivers please be careful because you never know who to trust. Watch out for the signs because I’m 25 and I still shake, I’m still scared and I do remember. I don’t wish this feeling on anyone but I finally opened up to my boyfriend and it felt good to tell someone. I will confront them one day."

itsrin17_,depression,1620613833.0,What has me depressed today.,"Please don't be too harsh on me. I have a husky I got when I was 12. There was a lot of things going on in my life like my parent's divorce a couple of years later and divorce. I developed anxiety and depression disorder and had to go to mental facilities multiple times. We had my dog and sometimes we would let her go to my Nana's with her dogs for maybe a week or sometimes a month but still visit her. She had a bigger yard she could run and she enjoyed staying with my Nana.  At some point we tried to rehome her. When we went we noticed some aggressiveness with one of their dogs with my husky. They said they couldn't keep her after awhile but she eventually came home with us. This was in middle school. I am now 20 and have had her since. Even though it was ""my dog"" my parents never did extra training with her when I was a child. I did do some training with her when I was a kid though. When she was a puppy and my parents did take her to a dog training place before. My dog is a very good dog though. She isn't aggressive, she is healthy, she is friendly, she is good with kids. She is 9 now and when most people see her they think she is a puppy or younger. She is average 50 pounds for a female husky but most people think she is really small. Even though our vet has said nothing about it. She does have separation anxiety though. At the time at my age we didn't give her the training she needs to be okay in her crate. I feel bad even though I was a child for not finding the proper resources to train her for that. She is okay now with her separation anxiety when being left at home. Our older dog died almost two years ago around my husky's b day. My husky didn't like to be without her. We also have a cat. Even though my cat dislikes my dog they are still okay with each other. I think having my cat is what keeps her calm at home when we leave. She used to not be able to sleep alone but now instead of sleeping with me she sleeps downstairs by herself sometimes which is good.  We had some issues with her using the bathroom I'm the house due to urine incontinence but it is slowly getting resolved. Sometimes she is disobedient and will not do what I ask if she sees she will not be rewarded with a treatment she is very food motivated. Sometimes I do just feel guilty though for not training her enough. She does have good life though and goes on road trips, car rides, has dog friends to play with and things like that. I felt guilty because sometimes she escapes out of the house or sometimes I trust her a bit too much and she takes off. Not around the neighborhood but sometimes she will do a lap around the hosue or go on one of our neighbors yards. Our neighbors dog comes over to our house too because my older dog that  used to be best friends and they would run to each others houses at the porches or front doors. We have a mini park in the back with some woods. Sometimes when it is dark around closing time for the park I would let her off leash to get a run in. I've seen other people do it in the morning or at night. Usually if there is a person she keeps distance and I tell her to go home. She will usually go home to our front door. I've been trying to train her off leash but because of her personality sometimes I can't always trust that she will keep her distance from unexpected oncoming people. So there have bee mn some embarrassing moments. Sometimes I dont know what I was thinking but instead I've been taking her to dog parks bit she is a little uncomfy with bigger dogs being in her face, so she will do a little air nip to some dogs to give her some space. Somtimes she also puts down her tail so she wont be smelled, but will smell other dogs. I don't take her as much but sometimes but she does enjoy it when meeting other people. I have seen her play a bit with some of the smaller dogs which makes me happy. It is also weird with recall because everytime I go to a dog park even the really large ones she listens to my recall without hesitation but at home or around my hosue it is a different story. I also felt bad because one of my aunts came over and my husky was trying to smell her after they came in. I didn't know she was afraid of dogs. I kind of wish that they told me that they were coming over because it was unexpected. My dog didn't want tk be put away and was crying when I put her outside. She doesn't get jumpy with guests for like she curious or wants to be acknowledged. I feel bad for not training her more on it but it never came into my mind since we have never had a problem with guests over because she is usually good and after awhile she minds her business. I want to train her to do better but it's going to be hard to find sometimes to try and pretend to be a ""guest ringing the door bell everyday so she will get it. I dont know but its just been weighing  on my mind today and making me depressed for not being better. I did train her today and she did well and hopefully throughout the week and slowly lean off it. I am trying to be better. I didn't want to post it on the dogs reedit because I feel like I would be labeled as a terrible owner. I don't think i am. I just know I can be better."

One plus it would have if I start up again is one less opportunity to eat crap at a meal. I used to be such a healthy eater and since entering the worse bout of depression of my life earlier this year, I’ve only managed to be able to feed myself nutritionally void meals of mostly starch, fat, sugar, etc. I also rely on takeout a lot and want nothing more than to start eating healthier again as I am hopeful it will help my energy levels, outlook, etc.

I fucked up everything, i don’t see a future where i’m actually happy. I’m such a pathetic excuse for a human being and i’m honestly just a waste of space. I wish i could at least do something right and just end my life. All the stress from school and all the other dumb shit is all for absolutely nothing. why should i wait and suffer for the rest of my life when i can just end it now? no one will ever truly love or care about me. no one gives a shit about me, including me. i really just don’t have any motivation to keep living."
Yoshiiboy123,depression,1620502332.0,"Oh yeah, the urge to make another depressing reddit post has returned","The title speaks for itself to an extent. Today is not a good day. I haven't posted on Reddit in a while, I was using it as a way to try to get support from strangers, after all, I would never meet them so it didnt matter what I said. One of my friends found my reddit account and asked if I was okay. so that wasnt good, I hadnt posted in a while so I managed to get them to leave the topic. and then recently my mum implied that I would end up in a psychiatric ward because of self harming, and then I would have horrible, shameful scars on my arms for the rest of my life, and I would be in my mid twenties or thirties, embarrased with makeup on my arms. Fear has always been a motivator for me. It got me to start self harming, and this got me to stop. I promised her I would never do it again, and she refused to believe me, saying that it had become a habit. I am so much stronger than that, it doesnt feel like it right now, but I know I am.

Anyway, to get to the point of the depressing reddit post. I had a little mini-meltdown last night, (maybe because I lost my one coping mechanism, who really knows?) told one of my friends how I was feeling and I felt so disgusted with myself. they have shared problems and things with me before, but it just felt wrong. All of my life I have held my tongue, and been silent. it makes things easier in the short term, but in the long term it makes things worse. I never asked for help for anything, and now I cant ask for help. Ive felt sick and disgusted with myself all day. I want to talk to them more, because it was quite nice to share my feelings for once, but I was in a particularly vulnerable position last night, and I dont want to burden them with this, so I was thinking of waiting some time before talking with them about it again, but I dont really know."

CalmRich123,depression,1620472106.0,"I planned on killing myself tonight. With encouragement from someone on reddit, I called a medical centre, visited them, and talked with me for an hour. They assessed me and are going to ring me tomorrow with a plan. I kinda wish I killed myself.","I wasn’t doing very well in high school. At 15, my mother pushed me to drop out of school for community college, but I wanted to change from the private school to the public school. I was bullied at school and unsafe at home. I was screamed at regularly and pushed for it.

I changed schools. It was a better environment for me and it was a disaster but I kept resisting my mother’s attempts to kick me out of school - because I believed leaving school means you failed at life. I kept conflicting with my parents and getting counsellors to intervene to speak for my interests.

I left school with no qualifications.

At 18, I was suicidal. My mother didn’t believe me, went ""boo-hoo you have it so tough"" when I was on antidepressant withdrawals, refused to support me for medication, tried to push me to stop taking them without any medical assistance. A counsellor saw the situation getting out of hand and had to intervene.

I did one art course I didn’t want to do. I was screamed at for asking to change.

Left that, did a university preparation course. My mother threatened to cancel this course on me - pretending she has any control over my life. I was very destructive and hurtful for others, I seeked out toxic sites for information on how to navigate life. Was hurtful, immature, lost a lot of friends. In one class, I was texting a support text number. The teacher didn't want me texting in class, took me out of the class to ask why I won't stop, I told her I was texting a counsellor about suicidal ideation, and she ended the class and took me to hospital.

I passed first semester of university preparation, then failed the second twice.

After that, 20 was the age anyone can go. My mother pushed me into another art degree I didn’t want to do. I did a year of it confused, left after a year. I was being targeted online and it affected me more intensely than the average person. An ongoing repetitive obsession. People were falsely accusing me on crimes over Facebook. I would feel intense emotions and leave class early to go home, struggle to sleep. My counsellor got sick of me, dismissed my concerns, called me autistic. I later learned a counsellor isn't qualified to make an assessment like that and I believe this was a malpractice.

When I asked for a diagnosis after being called autistic, they referred me to a facility. The facility asked for my story, I told them, and they said ""sorry, we only deal with serious situations."" This means I never was able to find out who I am.

Started a degree I wanted to do at 21. Cheated my way through the year.

Then I got depressed and dropped out. Spent a year on the welfare, with intense trauma from my past experiences. Welfare recommended me to a supermarket job so I did that in 2019. I kept talking to myself, was very depressed, couldn’t cope with it. Eventually they had to take me hospital because I was very suicidal and they could sense it. I did door to door sales for a few weeks then left. Being called autistic, I found depressing statistics around autism (unemployment, suicidal ideation, divorce, etc.) and it made me feel hopeless, I found incel forums which reinforced these feelings.

While I was on the welfare and working at the supermarket, I cut off contact with my mother. My sister thought I was blaming her and ""not being an adult"" but I disagree. My sister has gotten vicious over it. My sister is blindly ignoring clear wrongdoing. Even if I graduated by now, I'd still have issues with her and a desire to cut her off.

My mother felt like she failed as a mother and was very upset. My mother and father recognise wrongdoing, but it is mainly because me cutting off family caused distress. All my mother would think about is how she lost her son and it upset her.

Did a year of uni online, got the paper I missed in my time before.

Then in second year but not sure if I should be doing this because I cheated in the first. And in general I just feel like a total disaster and failure.

I’m 25 and experiences from high school and 15 years old still affect me. Trauma blows, man.

I feel a great deal of annoyance at myself. I repeatedly fought for opportunities, then spoiled them when I got them. I put no effort towards school or university, and often was very destructive and hurtful. I have justified reason to be angry at my parents, but when the pain softens, I'm left with a disappointment in myself. I screwed my life up. I got every opportunity I fought for and screwed it up.

I also know what needs to be done. I would need to come to terms with what has happened, accept it, accept I can't change. Accepting the past will be a daily challenge that gets easier over time. I will need to accept life will always be challenging and I will always be a bit neurotic — talking to myself, consistent ruminations on past experiences and people from my past, a slight degree of social awkwardness/strangeness — but regular challenges with neurosis would not make you uncommon. Understand while your parents fucked you over, they do support you know and corrected their wrongs - there are many parents who wouldn't be willing to.

I would need to start my Computer Science degree from scratch. Either admit to my university the situation, while willing to take any potential blowback or bad marks I get, or start over at another university. Do not spend time focusing on what you could or couldn't have done, but instead just rigorously and persistently focus on the task at hand.

It then raises the question of if I can be bothered starting a degree from scratch. To some degree, even if I know the answers to my problems, there is a big part of me that can't be bothered.

I haven't been able to study effectively and couldn't cope with full-time work, so that renders me useless in the world.

Anyway. It is late and I wanted to get my feelings out there.

I'm saw a General Practitioner to talk about diagnosis. They are referring me to a psychologist who could take weeks to get back to me. I think there is a good chance I have an undiagnosed mental illness which has been getting in the way of me functioning properly. Being diagnosed could help me understand myself and learn how to navigate things better. But even then, I could just end up going through more dogshit and false hope. Every day when I look at social media, I feel like a depressing failure."
amanda1o12,depression,1620496937.0,Question about Zoloft,"So I recently started Zoloft for my depression and I was just curious if anyone else felt almost eccentric on it?  I’ve been on it before and every time I start Zoloft I seem to really become impulsive and not caring as much.

I go from randomly going to a club to party at 1 am on a tuesday to 2 days later sobbing feeling too bad to leave my bed ever again. (Pre covid example) It also feels like things are crawling on the inside of my head or brain and that my mouth almost has like cotton in it.

h2omelons24,depression,1620630456.0,Old feeling revisited,"On Oct 11, 2015, I saved a note on my phone. Almost six years later, I’ve found this note again and feel so connected with this note. 

I know I'm not okay, I hope I'm gonna be okay. It's okay not to feel okay. It feels like I've given up, I let my insecurities get the best of my abilities I want to go on and try for myself, fight for myself but right now I can't. Take my wrists because I can't move them on my own. I need someone to guide me on my way, to encourage me on my way, to hold me when I stray from clarity. Oh sweet clarity, once when I was so certain of my destiny, of the path I wanted to take, nothing stood in my way, the obstacles I had to face seemed so minuscule. It's so naive to think inside this little bubble, but I can't blame myself when I sought out for something more because all my life I had known so little and wanted so much more. I needed to burst that bubble to learn if I was going to finally breathe or if it was to leave me gasping for air. I loved passionately for the first time, I soared across the sky for the first time, and for the first time I fell and couldn't rise to my feet on my own. I have never failed and failure was not the fondest of my memories. It was unfamiliar and it scared me how unpredicted this came and how little I knew about it. I climbed each day, still with a bruised heart, to make it across the finish line. I finished, Yet it didn't feel honest. Looking back, These new experiences were necessary for my growth, that I can understand but what I can't get over the most is how little I did this for my own, how unaware I was of the hurt it was causing me inside. How wrong it feels now and how lost I find myself. What is there now? What's to become of me after all these years of fighting for one thing, that now doesn't feel rightfully mine? I've grown so detached, and it ponders the question of when did I lose my desire, when did the fire inside me die? It's wrong of me to live my life seeking approval when all this time I should have learned to defend my own character and desires. Reality stroked me hard because I didn't account for factors that may interrupt my well-being, my self-worth, my youth, and I closed myself off to emotions because I considered myself to hold mechanical features, but it's apparent that I'm no machine, and I have a soul to care for. What's left of me is just a self conscious human being living with the same vulnerabilities as my peers. From this point, I know I have to fight it, but it's hard. It's so much easier to be numb. It's so much easier to wallow away and avoid the pain. I don't want to have to answer questions right now. I need to figure this stuff out. I want time to stop for a moment without hurting anyone, to use this time to reflect and make new revelations, to make new goals, to strive for self improvement , to be happy, and to be okay. I know I'm not okay, take me for who I am right now, because I'm still dealing with all these new emotions, this uncontrolled environment, and although I wish I could bring the change to make me happy, it's a process and it's definitely not one I can do on my own. The support of my family would be appreciated, and as a family I want what's best for all of us, and I apologize if I got caught up in what's best for me.  I know by helping myself out is going to help them out, but that's hard to believe when I don't see them wanting that change."
The_Heef,depression,1620486597.0,I was actually excited about turning 40 until this week.,"My birthday is a week from today. I was genuinely excited to make it to 40. There have been plenty of times where I didn’t think I was going to see 40, and after the changes I’ve made in the last year or so, I was happy to turn 40. But this week just reminded me of all the shit that made me depressed in the first place.  
  
I’m a teacher. Again. I quit 10 years ago and I decided to come back because 1) chemistry temp jobs are a joke and 2) I had to do something during the pandemic to help. And this was Teacher Appreciation Week here in the States. I didn’t become a teacher again to be liked, but it’d be nice. Maybe they should consider moving it to a week where the kids aren’t checked out already.  Didn’t help that my friend (also a teacher) posted a care package from his wife, full of his favorite snacks and breakfast bars. I got a scalp massager and got excited because now I don’t have to pay SportClips the extra $5 so they can do it.
  
With things opening up even a little, I wanted to mark the occasion (with masks, obviously). But it started to feel a little bit like the episode of The Office where Michael organizes all these things for his birthday and the only one enjoying it is him. Not to mention, why set up something when 90% of the people I invite will cancel the day of anyway? 

I have no holidays left. Both my parents have passed, and I don’t have kids, so Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas (Mom also died two weeks before Christmas, too.), any of the fun ones...gone. They’re just days to me now.  
  
I know it’s some paranoid notion that I feel like no one cares, but the older I get, the more real it gets. Everyone’s got their own lives and spouses and kids to care for. I have an unsuccessful dating app run every few months between depression episodes. Why should I care if no one else does?"

Last year I lost my girlfriend, and was attacked by a dog and it disfigured my face. Now I feel like nobody will ever love me, too. I feel ugly, hopeless, and useless.

Misty__IV,depression,1620460396.0,I Am A Disappointment To My Father,"Let me just say my relationship with my father went downhill when I was about 8.  He was having problems with his own parents and that created problems within our relationship.  I was a daddy's girl before then.

The actual 'verbal abuse' started in the beginning of the 7th grade.  I'd turned 13 and started wearing black band tees and chopped my hair at about shoulder length (parents thought it was too short but were ok with it for the time being) anyways, the first 2 months of school that year became a total nightmare.  My dad started suddenly telling me that I looked like a weirdo and that kids at school probably saw me that way to.  He'd give long lectures about my style and how no ones gonna wanna marry a girl who dresses the way I do, but the way he spoke to me always felt like the way a father would speak to his rebelious son.  Just his tone and constant swearing.  Idk.  Btw my sister was the one who got me into that emo style/culture and actually sported a haircut similar to mine, but much longer, so she didn't get much of the same treatment. 

And I mean, I get it.  Even I still cringe at the style I had back then, but looking back, I don't think the way he spoke to me was the way a father should ever speak to his own daughter.  I wonder if he acts that way towards me because maybe he wishes he had a son, but instead ended up with me?  Everyone did assume I'd be a boy before my mom had me.  I am also certainly the tomboy of the sisters. Maybe that says something?  Either way, I hate the way he speaks to me.  He has often told me I should be more feminine and whatnot.  Not in a creepy way but in more of a ""why can't you just be a normal daughter"" type of way.  How can I feel feminine when you make fun of my style, call me a ""fucking weirdo"", constantly tell me to ""be normal"" and ask me if theres something wrong with me mentally?  A lot of kids go through stupid phases, but both my parents, mainly dad, made me feel as though it was much deeper than that.  I remember them telling me ""you'll never be successful if you continue dressing that way"".  They were truly disappointed in me.  A 13 year old girl, still going through puberty, starting to compare herself to other girls, starting to have her own insecurities, and on top of that... having her own father insult her looks and speak to her as though he's speaking with a grown man, thinking that maybe it'll get her to stop dressing that way and finally be normal.  Let's just say it made me look and feel even less feminine. 

I ended up cutting my hair into a pixie (kept the bangs long due to insecurities) and my parents went completely bonkers.  Yes it was kinda bonkers and I was just a stupid kid, but their insults after that just made me feel even worse.  They started telling me I looked like a boy.  ""Why are you trying to look like a boy?""  ""If you think you're ugly, why make yourself look worse?""  ""Are you mentally ill?  Is that why you dress that way""  ""Do you know what a dyke is?  Well you look like one."", most of the insults coming from my dad.  He then one day asked me in front of everyone if I was a lesbian.  I said no and he accused me of lying.  I ran to my room crying, only to have mom come in and ask me the same question once more, but in a calmer tone. No, I'm not a lesbian! Stop asking! 

The tip on the icing was when I was sitting on the couch watching tv, my dad came and sat on the other sofa, mom was in living room to btw.  Few seconds later he tells me, ""Do you know the short hair makes you look fat?""  My mom defended me and told him to stop and that he shouldn't say that.  It's funny cuz I had kinda thought I was chubby, as most young girls do, but he pretty much confirmed it for me in my mind.  I ditched the t shirts and wore only sweaters after that to cover myself. He then starts calling me ""sweater girl"". Kinda funny...until he went out of his way to actually BURN one of my sweaters. And everyone laughed. What's also funny is that I'd seen pictures of me at that age and I was thin, never fat. Guess that was just his way of trying to yet again convince me to ""be normal"".

The thing is, I know he loves me very much. But he has issues controlling his anger and has his own insecurities, as well as problems with his own parents, specifically his mother. It makes him say the stupidest things. I just wish he was strong enough to have not had it affect our relationship. Because it's truly what's caused so much pain in my own life that wouldn't be there otherwise, like my social anxiety, my depression, the fact that I've been homeschooled for 4 years since I was 14,  all because I couldn't stand being around people anymore.  Everyday is the same day for me.  Every week is the same for me.  I don't go out.  I have no friends.  I'm am alone.

I know this is long. I just really needed to vent this out somewhere.  I've spoken to my mom about this once or twice before, but she still doesn't get me, or maybe she just doesn't know how to help me.  But any advice or support would truly help me out guys."
icecreamsandals,depression,1620611654.0,Everything I see is “tainted”?,"This is the best way I can describe it. I can’t see a picture from the 70s without thinking about how the people in it are old or dead now. I can’t talk to my parents without wondering when they’ll be gone. There’s also a perfectionism aspect to it. No work is ever good enough to submit, no activity is ever fun enough to enjoy, there’s always something ‘wrong’ with my environment preventing me from enjoying anything or starting anything. It’s like I’m constantly overthinking everything and taking life too seriously. There’s some level of ignorance that is needed for sanity, but my brain is acclimated to seeing right through everything. Yet, I’ve never had major depressive episodes or suicidal thoughts.

I don’t know where I’m going with this but I just wanted to rant. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder, but have been prescribed adderall XR due to inattention from a family physician (though I still have to see a psychiatrist for a formal diagnosis). It helps, especially with productivity but is inconsistent and makes me crash hard after 8 hours. I’m beginning to think my inattention and constant disinterest and tiredness come from depression, but of course I will talk to my doctor. Is what I’ve described similar to others experiences with major depression or dysthymia? Not asking for a diagnosis on myself but simply your personal experiences"
Ok-Illustrator7834,depression,1620501588.0,Is it normal to feel very angry and depressed when normal people justify your suffering and try to make it look better ??,"I've been depressed and suicidal for five years now. And it gets worse day after day to the point that I can no longer cope with my simplest problems, and I prefer to stay in bed all day long . I had a lot of trauma in recent years, but the biggest cause of my depression is my spine problem. But after I thought about what happened these years, I found that the thing that caused me the most psychological suffering was not the pain resulting from my chronic health problem .., but the things that I heard from people in my surroundings. I feel intense anger , followed by a long wave of depression and sometimes nervous breakdowns whenever I hear healthy people try to convince me that I am supposed to be content and accept my catastrophic life as it is. Especially what I usually hear from religious people ... when they try to convince me that there is a good divine plan behind my illness ... when I hear such words that make my suffering an acceptable and positive thing ... I become insane . For example : two years ago when I tried all the treatments and didn't work. I became suicidal ..My mother told my aunt about that .. so she came to visit me and told me that I'm weak ! ..My aunt.. a healthy, successful, rich woman who has not faced any big  problem in her life .. tells me that I am weak because I think about suicide after suffering daily and for years with an untreated disease that destroyed my youth and all my dreams in life .. She did not  suffer a minute, what I suffered for years, but this did't prevents her from calling me weak   ..I can't even describe how I felt in this situation . Last month my doctor told me that I must be thankful for God because there are much worst diseases than my disease ... wtf !!! ... As if I was born to suffer and I should be thankful because this suffering could be worse .. but living as normal people and pain free ..is too much to ask !! !!  My depression gets worse whenever I hear things like this from healthy people who do not even know what they are talking about..Perhaps because I suffer to the point where it is impossible to be convinced that there is an answer or a reason that makes my suffering acceptable or justified...I feel that trying to make it look better is insensitive and inhumane  .Is it normal to feel this ??  Am I too sensitive ?? Or is the problem in the terms that my arabic society uses to console me?"
SakuraAxolotl,depression,1620632331.0,I give up. I'll never amount to anything,"I turned 19 on the 1st and I already have nothing. No GED, no license, no money. No talent. I cant even get accepted as the gender I want to be. I give up. I will never get commissioned, I will never get hired anywhere. My art will never take me anywhere in life. I see so many videos of where someone gets offered their dream job, or someone's talent gets shared and then they blow up and have a ton of people supporting them. That will never be me, no one sees me. No one cares. I will never get that break. My art has never gone anywhere and it never will. I can see the disappointment in my parent's faces and hear it in their voices. I think about dying. They'll be free from the financial burden I am. They say it's fine, but I know it's not. I don't want them to suffer from my uselessness anymore. I wish I had talent, I wish I could do something with my art. I want to make art for video games. But I know it'll never happen.

Travis-Walden,depression,1620425754.0,"Had a good day and now I’m a bit terrified, sigh","
I’ve been depressed for quite some time now, since 2014 to be precise. The lockdown has been pretty harsh and the last few days haven’t been easy to get by. 

Today, I finally caught a break in life by getting an internship I’ve been relentlessly pursuing for the last 6 months. After a lot hard work, lots of ins and outs, lots of twists and turns, I’ve finally gotten the internship and am a bit happy. And I am extremely proud of getting this internship because I had to hustle a lot and stray far off from my comfort zone. 

Now that the internship offer has sunk in, I’m afraid of something terrible would happen to me soon which would plunge me back into sorrow. The fact that I’m in India, a country where the Covid pandemic is wrecking havoc of an unimaginable magnitude doesn’t really help. 

I feel I’ve somewhat lose the ability to be happy because I view it as a precursor to negativity, a foreshadowing of sorts, so to speak. I’ve got to learn to be happy once again. 

I was a happy kid growing up, and that’s what I got to be like."

The_Viv_Element,depression,1620622616.0,Dreams,"So I just had one of those vivid dreams where school was over (i haven't been in school for 7 years) and everyone was leaving with their friends, then I just realized I was waiting for nobody and I just wanted to curl up in a ball and die outside on school property but my dream made me walk from school to home alone and i remember walking that whole way crossing intersections and cars zipping by... 

thinking ""I've got noone, I've got nothing to look forward to, I'm so alone in this crowded world"" it took too long for this dream to end and I didn't even get home. Now I'm awake and super depressed... normally I'm okay with depression and I've gotten used to being alone in my 4 walls for the last 5 years but I think it's starting to take a toll on me & I hate this feeling that nothing is okay. 

For more context, I'm deaf so it's harder to make friends in person, I'm also a high school drop out because I made stupid choices leading to drugs and drama (dont worry I've been sober and drama free for the last 5 years) I used to not know who I was growing up and I was very lost in the world. But I discovered myself recently & and I've never been happier because now I dont feel so empty inside, I feel like a person / human being but that nagging thought of me being alone and not achieving anything with my life is always there and its gotten very debilitating to the point I try not to leave my room unless I absolutely have to. I have too many regrets I'm holding onto and I hate where I ended up in life because of my past actions.

She said if i dont have a real job by next month she would leave me.
I did get a job but they let me go after a day cause i had weed in my system which was the way id cope with all the shit in my brain.
I feel like ive never done anything right all my life, just coasted by, doing the minimum in school just to pass. Now that im out of school im so lost i dont know where to turn or what to work toward.
I used to use youtube and video games to help cope too but its all blended into a big grey mass of self loathing and failure.
Most days i hate myself for all this, why was i put here, cause clearly im just a waist of space, a waist of air, a waist of food.
I ask my friends for advice and they always say the same thing, just try, just take a step. Problem is i forgot how to walk.

I don't know where this self hatred started from cause its been around most my life but im really getting tired of it and everything, tired of letting everyone down.

You ever think it would all be bettee if you just disappeared, how happy everyone would be, how you wouldnt have to keep bothing everyone with your same stupid shit?

Since then I figured, if I were to cut deep into a major artery it would be easy. So last night, I did it. I felt like hitting a jackpot. But it didn’t kill me, all I felt was cold. I didn’t want to go thru Mother’s Day, not because I’m grieving but I don’t see much in my mum.

Had my driver to get me to A&E; the attending doctor asked if I was doing fine. The surgeon who patched it up spoke to me as it goes. Driver called my sister and that’s when everything went downhill. She came down, had to remind me how useless and trashed up I was. Again putting the blame on me, I couldn’t go thru that ordeal again. We had a heated argument that lead to getting a tad physical. She was hitting so much that I had enough and pushed her. Her fall had fractured her ankle. 

As much as she deserves it, I felt bad. Maybe she’s right, I’m just a useless trash. Now I’m back home feeling very dark, like someone is just telling me to do it again. Inner thigh hurts a lot cause the cut was deep and I had cut upon the femoral artery"

It is my last year of studying and I wasted it all over the past 3 months I didn't turn in any university work and it's past deadline, I missed exam which is 50% of the final grade of the only subject that I'm relatively interested in. And I'm just feeling numb, I'm lying to my parents, who are getting really pissed with me, they talk about all other friends kids who study and work and I only worked for a few months over the course.  
I'm running on borrowed time, my parents already are planning to kick me out if I don't get a job and I don't blame them, they forbid me from taking their food to force me to earn some money so I do shit like surveys online and buy pasta.  
I told my mom I want to kill myself a year ago and asked her not to tell anyone, then my parents approached me and made fun of me basically explaining to me that I had no right to be depressed and I had to apologize, basically I had to apologize to them for various things daily pretty much, I feel so powerless, idk I disserve it probably.  
Nothing really interests me at this point, I used to be into biology in secondary school and college but I burned out and swapped to computer science, I started of well, scoring 90% and ending barely getting to the last year which I'm going to fcking fail and I don't give a fck somehow, It feels so fcking over, I have 0 direction in my life and I will live on the streets soon or kill myself, I already tried once but failed, didn't tell anyone.  
I really don't know what can I do, my parents will be so pissed, they will blame me rightfully, and I will have to get a retail job again or something and they will be so disappointed, (I don't want to tell them that, literally started crying right now think about it), we are from 2nd world country and my family moved to a first world county so me and my brother can have better future, I can't live with that.  

Worst part is I don't feel shit, I don't remember last time I was moved or happy and I can't think of anything to do that I wouldn't get burned out of in few months, it's always like this, I get excited about something, and I do fairly well, then something changes, idk, and my performance plumits.  
  
I don't know what to do, In so pathetic, I have 0 interests I wish I could stay in bed forever, I wish I could kill myself without destroying my mom, I'm such a failure, I recognize that and I was always putting in minimal effort just to get along, I actually never did something because I enjoyed it for the sake of it, it was always to be better than others or to get good grades, you don't get grades for social skills, you get them for shutting the fck up and listening ""you are such a nice well behaved kid"" they used to say, now I'm the ""weird adolescent"", they give me weird looks, they feel sorry for be, they think I'm abnormal, they are happy their kids are normal.  
  
My parents pretty much forbid me from getting therapy, with my evasive personality they would probably have to force me to talk to psychiatric.  
I used to have 2 friends, now they cut off contact with me and when I last met them before covid they were looking weird at me, thinking about it is the most upsetting, I would die for them in and instant (ironic since I don't value my life highly).

His wife left him about one year ago (she was a big support) and he has a 2 year old daughter. 

He says thinks like that he better goes now then later so his daughter doesn't understand it and she just doesn't remember him. 
He says he just doesn't have any energy anymore and that he suffered his entire life. 

Last therapist he has seen about 2 years ago. 

I don't know what to do.

I think its depression that is holding us back from being what we could be. 

I know this is almost like relationship advice but I am more worried about our mental health. Is it possible her being so horribly depressed and melancholy that it has stressed me out to where now I am depressed?. I dont want to be one of those guys that snaps and beats his gf because he feels she is sucking the life oit of him. Its just so sad. My son even had his lil suspenders on and everything. If anything his is a vent post. Im going to have to put my foot down. She has been in the mental hospital before and is too uneducated to fill out any court paperwork. I feel like I am about 2 seconds from finding someone thats grateful. Hell half these girls would love the double 70 inch 4k tvs x box and a luxurious lifestyle compared to most. They would have no problem taking care of my son especially at this age. Then just maybe then I could come home to a clean house a cooked meal and maybe fucking accomplishing something for herself for once.

My concern is probably more with mental health in general. I'm in my early 30s, and for about 12 years, I've suspected that I might have some form of bipolar disorder.

I went to college at a highly religious university, and the few times I've met with a therapist, I feel like they just kinda blew off looking for the real problems. 

I have terrible anxiety and crippling depression, but not all the time for some reason. It comes in waves, followed by an over-the-top happiness phase that can just as quickly snap me into a terrible rage at literally nothing. 

I don't know who to go to or what to do. I'm terrified of seeing a doctor. I have no idea who I should even see. Do I call a therapist or a psychiatrist? How do I know how insurance works? These questions hold me back from ever making a decision, and mental state just keeps getting worse. 

Nothing is wrong in my life. I am in a great place. Not rich, but employed in a position I am happy with. I am surrounded by family who show me way more love than I show them. I don't deserve them. I'm living in literal paradise, yet I hardly ever get outside to see it. I feel like I can't breathe. I can't even get out of bed to play videogames or make a coffee. I pretty much only leave the house to work, or occasionally when my wife drags my ass to do something fun with the family (which leads to a whole new slurry of social anxieties that I never had growing up).

Polarbear1054,depression,1620457550.0,Looking for motivation again,"Jeez I have not been here in awhile I definitely should have revisited sooner. Honestly life didn’t get much better a couple of advances but mostly things are still static. I started a delivery job at my uncle’s restaurant and it’s been paying well, I’ve saved up enough to maintain my car, help with rent, and even buy my own ticket for Morocco.

It sounds great but I’ve also been lying to all of my friends and coworkers that I’m attending school. To the point that I’m making lies about days I can’t work to make it more believable. I sent my application for school way too late and haven’t received a response back. in my parents eyes I wasted a year, because I didn’t go to school right after. I’m now scrambling to try to apply to the community college and get my shit together. And by scrambling i mean keeping it in the back of my mind until I eventually crash and burst out on the wrong person, or actually apply. I can’t even lie to myself and say I’m trying my best.

I went out for ftour (breaking fast for Ramadan) at the restaurant I work at and when we were cleaning up and trying to take our food home I got called fat by my coworker Alex for taking food home. 
“He’s already 300lb why would he want more!?”
Even though I laughed it off and my uncle wanted to yell at him I just cleared the situation so nobody had to feel bad. But truly that shit hurt me, I couldn’t ruin the night and it honestly pushed me to come back here. Almost a safe zone were I actually just let it out. I’m having thoughts of starving myself and as horrible as it seems I’m honestly thinking about it as a viable option. I’m gonna attempt to wake up in the morning to go to the gym and try to work out again after not going for more than a month. 

Shit was simple and god do I miss it, I see my friends who are the same age as me, and coworkers younger then me with a future already started or already laid out for them and I’m just gasping for air trying to catch up. I’ve been playing way to many video games lately and I want to attempt a week break although it will be hard I think it will reset me mentally. Of course this is a lot of motivation and shit talking from an overweight dude at 3am but I have to talk to someone. My parents are too old and don’t have an understanding of where I am and it will only make me feel worse from their textbook response, my sister has her own life there’s no need for me to ruin it with a stupid rant, she has enough on her plate. I need to fucking get it together or my life is worthless. If I don’t get it together then killing myself would be the best option, as extreme as it sound, no weight is better then dead weight."

Clefty96,depression,1620622039.0,Therapy doesn't work for everyone,"""Get therapy""

""You need therapy""

""Have you talked to a therapist about this""

The amount of times I receive responses like this is astronomical, and I've held my peace regarding my thoughts on the world of therapy for FAR too long. I am sick and tired of being told this is the end-all solution to my problems.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety right around the age of six after the passing of my father. Since I wasn't an adult and couldn't really make my own decisions, I was stuck bouncing from ""professional"" to ""professional"" for twelve years. It was always the same thing. They'd try to pry my soul open and prescribe experimental drugs that would work momentarily before fucking me up and leaving me feeling worse off than before or, in some cases, a psychiatric ward. The physical affects were there, too- I was morbidly obese for most of that timeframe. I don't think I really need to go into detail on all the bullying and harassment I got as a result of that alongside my cleft palette- I'm sure we all know just how fucking cruel kids can be.

When I turned 18, I said enough is enough and dropped the medications and the therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists. And you know what? My life is admittedly still a shit show. I have NO friends and NOBODY to talk to. Most people cannot stand me once I actually open up to them, which is harder to do now more than ever on account of being in abusive relationships and periods of having shitty friends. That said, I've honestly done more with myself than I ever did on all of that garbage and people with prestigious degrees poking and prodding my brain all day long. If I hadn't done this, I honestly have no idea how I'd even be able to drive or hold a job because of how much the meds screwed with me. I've also lost a TON of weight since I don't have the heightened appetite that I used to. I was once over 300 pounds...I'm now sitting at a comfortable 161 pounds and plan on being about 140 by the end of the year following some setbacks. In addition, I don't have to worry about the obscenely inflated costs of these ""professionals"" and medication that doesn't even work for me. I'm not exactly rich now, but there's no way in hell I'd be able to survive if I was stuck paying for that crap considering how much of a joke American healthcare is.

I'm not saying this is the path for everyone in a similar situation. I'm glad the shit works for the people who can afford it or actually benefit from it, but I can't say I'm one of those people and I know there are others. Telling me to ""go to therapy"" after wasting a dozen years of my life on it with hardly any (positive) results just sounds like you're telling me to go fuck myself at this point. If it was actually affordable and worked for me, I'd be all for it but that just isn't the case. I just wish people would stop acting like it's going to solve all my problems, or anyone else's for that matter."

Even if I want to get help for the issues I have, those hospitals were repurposed in to covid hospitals due to the country treating covid like a joke until it was too late, so I'm off seeking private healthcare that I can't even afford, whilst my anxiety acts up so hard that I sometimes just start crying while out in public, so I'm stuck desperately trying to make money through online means...and just ..fuck everything..

skinnyy2021,depression,1620609684.0,"besdies telling people it's ok to not be ok, we should also tell people it's ok to not be normal","For years, I feel like all my life has been me acting, saying lines because that's what the script says. 

you see, it's the little things. we tell people it's ok not to be ok but we don't really tell them it's ok to not be normal. if I told people I spend the holidays alone, they'd either get uncomfortable or find it weird. or worse, feel sorry for me. or they start thinking about what's wrong. never mind that I'm actually at peace with it. so it's easier to just lie.

Whenever I have to fill the in case of emergency contact field, I put my mom's name, though I haven't spoken to my family in years. The number is fake- also mine. While it looks like I have friends, there's no one out there who I'm close enough with. i could ask a casual friend, but it'd just lead to questions. so again, I lie.

Because while I am fine with all of the above, society isn't. I won't say I'm completely ok but I'm at peace.  But this constant subterfuge is draining. i do realize I choose to do this, that I can just not pretend, but it's easier this way. Not because I'm embarrassed of the truth. But because the truth is complicated. 

I know it's a coping mechanism that I never let people get close. I talk to people. i laugh. I can even be charming. but that's it. sometimes, it feels hollow. but at least it doesn't hurt. It'll probably be like this forever. If it is, that's ok. It's better than crippling depression right? At least I'm still functioning. It seems like a pittance and sometimes I feel like I shouldn't settle for this but you know what? At this point, I just want to be ok."

This weekend we found out my aunt had multiple strokes. Today doctors told us she is brain dead. She is technically still alive, but that is only because of the machines she’s connected to and the medicine they’re giving her. She is the rock in our family. Always there for other people. She is the glue in our family, she always brings us together. She is my dad’s best friend. She has helped him through his darkest times, she is the reason I still have him. She was perfectly healthy, 56 years old. And now she is gone. I don’t have many family members in general that I feel comfortable with. She is really the only family I’ve had, besides my dad and brother. She was the closest thing I felt like I had to a mom, because me and my mom have had a really bad relationship for over a decade. I feel so lost and empty. I don’t know why but I can’t stop feeling like I’m bad luck. I’m just everyone’s bad luck charm. Lately i feel like everyone I love is just suffering. I feel like as soon as I enter a chat, a group, a video game, whatever then toxicity and bad things happen. I’ve been telling my brother every night for weeks that I just don’t understand why bad things gravitate to me. He recognizes it too, how many bad things directly happen to me. Without going into my whole life story, I’ve only had abusive relationships, I’ve had manipulative and toxic friends my whole life, my mom singles me out to yell at and belittle. It just feels like never ending sadness and bad luck whenever I’m around. 

I wanted my aunt to be there for all my accomplishments. If I decide to go to grad school, whenever I get married, whenever I buy a home and raise a family. I wanted her there, because I knew she’d be unconditionally happy and supportive. The only other mother figure I had was my ex’s mom and I can’t talk to her. This feels like the 3rd mom I’ve lost in my life and it just feels like too much."

She_is_poetic,depression,1620494894.0,My boss is making my depression worse,"I’m having a really rough week. I’ve been on a new medication that is supposed to treat my PTSD and depression and there are great days but when things are bad the medication makes it feel like they are worse then they really are.  

Work in particular has been really difficult for a while now. Last year I was in the top 30% of the company but I felt like I was draining every ounce of live energy I had to get there. I was being told how good of a job I was doing in the moment but my boss would bounce back the next quarter and tell me I needed to do better. (Side note we have had a high turn over on our corporate team due to her management style). 

I have always been extremely ambitious and held myself to a high standard. I give my all to the work that I do and don’t believe in half ass-ing things. However, being told that what you do is never good enough really seeps in after a while and the last month or so that has impacted my motivation to do my job. I am still adhering the metrics, just not the “top tier”. She put me on a probation review at work for having 3 weeks of low job performance. This week she told me she has no confidence in my ability to do my job. 

I was in line to move into a different non-metrics based position in the company and she gave me a poor review in the final stage and they opted to select someone else. Mind you this is all based on the last few weeks of performance. 

She has also pushed me to reveal my mental health struggles to her and uses them against me. 

I feel like I am in such a shitty place and I feel so degraded and worthless. I have few friends right now and my support system is iffy.


Long story short: my boss is making work hard and my mental state is causing things to cave in."

I feel like a completely different person, after certain events that have sort of turned my world upside down. I wanted to ask you guys here if this falls within grounds of what depression is? 

I feel like I am completely unable to be an adult again. Moving back out, working regularly. Like, I have to survive and can’t lie in bed or cry as much as I do now. I need to be “on” 5 days a week, 7 hour days of which I am planning on with my new jobs. I am so scared. The thing is, I know I’m in a better place financially now. When I was younger I was so fearless and not so anxious and scared. I managed being on my own then, but now? I don’t know. 

I almost feel lazy for these feelings, but it’s like I overstretch myself and say”I’m going to do this. I need to grow up and take ownership of my life” and on the other I am so overwhelmed with school and working essentially three jobs. 

I think I’m ready to start the medication, but I’m scared. I’m scared I’ll change, or get a lot of side effects. I feel shallow, but im also scared I’ll gain a lot of weight, which I have heard is normal. 

I guess I’m just here to vent, and hear your thoughts or maybe guidance on this. Cause sometimes I don’t even know what I’m feeling or experiencing. I honestly DO want to feel muted. And not so emotional anymore."
htz245,depression,1620452411.0,"please read with an open mind, without any judgement","&#x200B;

October'20,  left the working lifestyle to focus mainly on health since the conditions that I was facing were complicated to balance up with the work-life. I'm still in my early twenties, so when friends or random peeps came to know of it, they would just blindly comment that "" Your parents are well off, you can afford to live without a job, don't need to worry about short in cash"" I hated that comment. 

six months down the road, presently, i am still out of the work life. and i am still surviving. my parents are gone so i have inheritance from them but i don't tap into the funds much. But since mum always reminded me to have a black card for medical, i waited for the invitation to arrive and yeah now i have one for myself. anyways, i have been using it only for medical purposes. eventually people start to notice the card, and the comments returned - why don't you use it for dining or shopping? why restrict yourself? i am not even given the space or writes to say ""oh i am tight on greens"". i used to limit myself on my monthly allowance, its more than sufficient. 

Just that last month and this month, my dark clouds had been really cloudy and bad. i have daily suicidal thoughts, sleepless nights almost everyday, lack of appetite, lack of motivation and mood, constant nightmares. as a result, i had gone back to spending constantly. i do feel bad, but i can't control it. buying stuff doesn't exaclty make me feel happier either. i had been buying a lot of shoes and mostly are impulse purchase, not that i need them. eventually i feel like maybe people are right, i am just a fucking spoilt prick. i can't survive with all these judgements, comments and labels that people make. it is sort of driving me to the edge - to suicide. 

""you don't need to work, you don't have to worry about running short of money, you don't have a family to feed. you can live that life forever"" 

growing up, if it's a bad season for depression, sometimes I would keep myself occupied to the extent of constant spending and impulse purchases. people labelled me off as spoilt, without understanding or offering help. I do have a shrink, and sometimes there are trauma and stuff in life that even having a shrink is not enough, requires the family and those who care about you to push for the better, which I lacked that since my parents didn't exactly care much of that. apart from my allowance, I had two black cards, one from mum and another from dad. Mum would always tell me to only use the card for medical purpose since health is always expensive. whereas dad didn't mind what I spent on - so that sort of fed my impulse purchases to ""ease off the dark clouds""...d what I spent on - so that sort of fed my impulse purchases to ""ease off the dark clouds"".

Do y'all actually feel better about yourselves after throwing such a hateful comment to me, a child?"

I dunno.

I just needed somewhere to say that life seems meaningless and sometimes it's really scary that we all won't exist one day. Like everything I feel and experience is meaningless, because no one will know or remember. I know this isn't novel, everyone wonders what the point is. But I just needed to put this somewhere.

CoolExchange4260,depression,1620533208.0,Am I looking for attention?,"I've been hospitalized and have had police come to my house a few times for telling close friends I was suicidal/saying goodbye. I've overdosed to try and kill myself, I still struggle with self-harm here and there. When my partner and I would have huge arguments, it would put me in a headspace where I feel worthless and want to end my life, and I would tell him that. But, I would try to convince myself how much of a bad idea it was to attempt, and wouldn't. Whenever I mention being suicidal (which at this point is only to my partner), I genuinely feel like I want my life to end so that my mental suffering can stop, but I can't bring myself to end it all. I'm not lying when I mention that I have suicidal thoughts, but I never have enough motivation to do it. I was called attention-seeking and that it was unfair that I got to tell him (my partner at the time) that I was suicidal and never actually go through with it. Now I'm overthinking and feel like maybe I am just an attention-seeker or convincing myself I'm more depressed than I actually am. I feel extremely ashamed of my mental health and my past related to it. Can someone tell me what they think?

TL;DR I was told I was attention-seeking because I've told someone I was close to multiple times I wanted to kill myself but haven't done it."

It was really hard to get the words to form in my mouth, it felt wrong but I managed. I knew they'd tell my parents and the police. I talked to an officer at my school and told him a bit about it, I refused to say what exactly happened and I also refused to give them their names.

I have to go to an interview with some other police officer, they want me to tell them what exactly happened but I dont know that I can..
My mom told my grandma when I got home and I didn't feel anything. I didn't say it so it wasn't that bad. I can see how they look at me differently, the sorrow in their eyes.

With depression a small step forwards feels like a leap, but a small step forwards is you heading somewhere - no matter how long it takes. 

The biggest yet tiniest step I took was forgiving myself for being ill. For having these chemical imbalances in my brain. For having to go see a doctor on a Sunday.

And the rest was history.

Aside from that, everything else “checks out.” I lose all interest in everything, won’t eat, won’t respond to any messages, can’t listen to music or watch tv because everything is extremely triggering and over stimulating. Then I’m unable to work and I have to go on leave. My panic chest pains and head pressure are so bad, which stresses me out even more. I’m unable to clean and take care of myself and I stop caring about my material possessions. 

It’s also hard to explain, but when the nonstop thoughts and panic get to be too much, it feels like I’m not really me and I’m super out of it. Also sometimes I’ll wake up and it feels like the day before was a dream 

Aside from my obsessive all consuming thoughts, I also spend all my time and energy “researching” the meaning of life and what happens after.

I just started taking Zoloft and it’s been helping. Also starting therapy tomorrow to manage this existential anxiety. We’re also looking into the possibility of OCD.

When I entered uni, I got into a deep depressive phase. It is a very prestigious UK uni and I don’t see myself leaving because of my academic background (always been a good student, have had good grades at this uni so far) but I really hate it. It got better at the beginning of this year when I changed my degree programme. However, with COVID, my mental health re-spiraled again and I just gave up on living in general. My fear of failure and my permanent state of sadness in the last 3 years just make me want to die. 

The trigger is that I didn’t submit an assignment, which means a fail which means it’s going to be on my transcripts hi how means a much lower classification which means not getting the masters or jobs I want. I know it’s not the end of the world for a lot of people but it is to me. The feeling I feel inside is of complete despair from both the recent trigger but mostly due to 3 years of ongoing sadness.

I have been seeing a therapist before (who all diagnosed me with severe depression), I am seeing one at the moment (it’s been 2/3 weeks with this one). I have also tried medication before with little success.

TW: suicide 

Hello all. I am new to this sub, but not to chronic pain. This past Friday I learned that I lost a dear friend to trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headaches. He held on for as long as he could, but with no sign of relief on the horizon he couldn’t hold on any longer. I recently learned about ketamine infusions and how life changing they can be, I also learned how they are not an option to so many due to costs. While processing my grief on Friday I decided to try to change the world. Which is funny coming from the girl who is terrified of walking into a room of strangers and being the center of attention, now suddenly I have decided I want the whole world to look at me and know mine and other chronic pain patients struggles. I am working on creating a social media campaign to fight back against big pharma and the pain clinics that rake in money hands over fist for a drug that is basically pennies compared to the fees they charge. On the day these pages go live I will need all of the help I can get to share the post to get it trending so it is not just scrolled past. I know like many others I have contemplated suicide to make the pain end and I want to end that. No one should feel that is their only option left. Right now my main goal is to get ketamine infusions indicated as a treatment for chronic pain, PTSD and depression to make it more affordable-but if these takes off other things like diabetes can be added."
