darling-driver,lonely,1619962786.0,To deserve being loved,"I'll probably not be able to make myself clear and some will say I'm complaining with a full belly, yarayara. But screw it, just want to get it off my chest.

Recently I came to a strong realisation: we humans can only love those who are willing to live.

When someone gives up on living (aka depression) we just stay by their side if we expect them to recover. Once we conclude that person can't be saved, we walk away from them. That is, unless we are forced to stay by their side by moral, social or legal circumstances; in that cases we stay, but facing it as a burden.

I gave up on living a long time ago, but I wouldn't say I'm depressed. My life is pretty ok, I'm just really not interested. And the idea of suiciding doesn't attract me. So I guess I'm halfway. I do the bare minimum just so I maintain my material conditions and then distract myself, waiting for my end to naturally come.

But it would be nice to have some company, y'know? I do have nice friends and family, but they're all busy... well... living. I wish I could have someone to live this no-life with me.

But as I said before, no one is able to love someone who gave up. So I guess I'll have to pretend I didn't. Or accept my lonely fate instead.",probably able make clear say complain full belly yarayara screw want get chest recently come strong realisation humans love live someone give live aka depression stay side expect recover conclude person save walk away unless force stay side moral social legal circumstances case stay face burden give live long time ago say depress life pretty ok really interest idea suiciding attract guess halfway bare minimum maintain material condition distract wait end naturally come would nice company know nice friends family busy well live wish could someone live life say one able love someone give guess pretend accept lonely fate instead

Before a week me and some online friends planned to finally meet and by that we would have a small 
4-person party for our loner friend that will have tommorow birthday and probably he would be alone, again. 
So we did travel to his city and he met with us, I was the only one in group who never seen any of them before so one extremly extrovert friend hugged me so much she almost broke my spine. Anyways, they are one of people that know I'm gay and I liked that loner from start, but he was trying nor to get too much close to me and that literally hurt my feelings. We came to his house, played ludo, laughed, had lunch and at the end of the day they escorted me to my bus because I was rhe first one that had to go back home, we hugged as saying goodbye, and then suddenly that loner said: ""Hey, Peter."" I rotated to him and he kissed me, it was just for a second, but it was amazing.. I said I wanted thst guy from the start and my dreams comes true. I love him, and only thing I wanted when I was on the bus was him, his beautigul eyes, his kindness, everything..

NationalPersimmon878,lonely,1619838748.0,I am at the worst pint in my life. Idk what to do anymore.,"This feels really awkward and embarrassing but I feel so shitty. I’m going to just rant about how I feel and my life even if no one sees because I need to. 
I am a 16 year old girl and I am a junior I’m high school. I am usually one of the best in my classes and I always got my work done. I have always worried about school and I have always gotten straight As. I currently still have straight As but I have really been struggling mentally and I have never felt this way before. 
I have repeatedly had depersonalization and derealization around 4 or 5 times in my life. It is honestly the worst thing to experience. (I feel like I am just watching my life through my own eyes but it doesn’t feel like me. I feel detached from everything.) it’s terrifying and I am pretty sureI have anxiety (I don’t want to self diagnose) which when my anxiety heightens enough I get depersonalization and derealization. Well lately, I feel isolated and lonely. My depersonalization, derealization, and anxiety has taken over my whole life. Even when I did get this in the past, I could always bounce back and continue with all of my responsibilities. Although it has never lasted this long (it’s only been around a month, which is not too bad) but in the first two weeks, everyday was a constant battle to fight my depersonalization and derealization by being going outdoors, reading, hanging out with family, etc. (Although it is extremely difficult to hang out with family because of my mental block to talk due to my dp and dr. So friends is out of the picture.) I was still getting work done, and I still was until right now. Although the last two weeks I have lost motivation for life and just stayed in my room and watched anime all day long. I did not realize the extremities of this until a few days ago, I realized that I wake up, watch anime, log into my online classes, and then watch anime and eat for the rest of my entire day. It’s so shitty and I barely realized that I sit for literally 10-12 hours without moving watching anime because I have nothing better to do, no motivation for life, no more motivation to do better or get better. I don’t really have any goals, and I never really knew my purpose in life. 
All that being said, I have already told my dad about my depersonalization, and he said that he will look into therapy for me (which I am excited for, I think that it will benefit me a lot, although I am scared to open up to someone). I don’t know what this feeling of not caring is. Idek what life is tbh lmao, I started to think that life you just do what makes you happy, and that enabled me to think that I could sit alone all day and watch anime bc that makes me happy. But i think it causes anxiety, because my dp and dr started to get better last week, I started to feel better, and now it is coming back. I am scared again. 
There’s a lot more that I could explain about my background that would explain a lot of my self doubt although this has been long enough and I am surprised if anyone will read it. 
But if they do thank you. I don’t know what to do. Tomorrow I will try to unplug but I have attempted that multiple times and it becomes a repeating cycle of trying to get my life back every day. 
I do think that staying indoors has negatively affected me as well, I am always in my room and lost all social skills (even though i already lacked them). I have gotten far more insecure and don’t want to even be seen by family anymore

Magoush,lonely,1620098611.0,I’ve been thinking about how my fucked up genes led me to become a failure. I want to share what happened in my life up till now (18),"Growing up I was just an ordinary kid but was born with Ventricular septum defect (VSD) which has made me physically very weak and led to my parents being overprotective. I moved to the USA in 2011. I got my surgery. I was an ordinary kid. When I got to middle school I reached puberty and my face became uglier and I got fat and started getting bullied. For 3 years from 6th to 8th grade, I didn’t have a single friend and the bullying permanently damaged me. When I got to high school I was afraid of talking to people thinking I might get them mad at me or that I might do something wrong. I was afraid to try anything. I was a loner my freshman year. All I did was watch YouTube all day. I remember my family being pissed at me for being a loner and antisocial all day and compared me to family members my age. Made me feel worse but I wanted to break out of my shell. I joined track but once again the bullying returned because I sucked at running. I was always short and skinny. I was 5’5 and 100 lbs. I remember feeling I’ve had enough and wanted to become someone ppl will respect and admire. My dad really wanted me to go to an Ivy League and become a doctor. I was the youngest in my family, shit happened and my siblings never got the chance to go to college so I was the only one left. I thought that was my chance. I spent the entire junior year of high school studying for the sat and looking to boost my application. I retook the sat 4 times and still got a lower score than some kids taking it once without studying. I took the subject tests and was so burnt out I scored bottom 10%. I thought if I could get a good SAT score ppl in my school and my family wouldn’t see me as a loser. Ofc I ended up just applying to a state university. I wanted to experience social life before I graduated so I tried so hard to get invited to parties but ppl just didn’t want me. My school was very sports focused and I didn’t really fit into any group and it was too late. Even the nerds didn’t want me. I ended up just staying home all day and watching YouTube videos like before until pandemic hit and graduation was socially distanced. I didn’t even wanna go to graduation. Now here I am done with first year of university. Ppl say first year is the best but I lived with my parents and online classes so I didn’t even get the first year experience and made 0 friends. I don’t even know what I will become in the future. I tried to improve my self in every way but I’m just shit at everything and stuck with my ducked up genes. Sometimes I wish I could swap places with someone from my country of origin because I don’t deserve this opportunity in life. I don’t know if anyone is still reading this but those of you who think ur a failure just know that ur not the only one",grow ordinary kid bear ventricular septum defect vsd make physically weak lead parent overprotective move usa 2011 get surgery ordinary kid get middle school reach puberty face become uglier get fat start get bully nmbr years 6th 8th grade single friend bully permanently damage get high school afraid talk people think might get mad might something wrong afraid try anything loner freshman year watch youtube day remember family piss loner antisocial day compare family members age make feel worse want break shell join track bully return suck run always short skinny nmbr nmbr lbs remember feel ive enough want become someone ppl respect admire dad really want go ivy league become doctor youngest family shit happen siblings never get chance go college one leave think chance spend entire junior year high school study sit look boost application retake sit nmbr time still get lower score kid take without study take subject test burn score bottom 10 think could get good sit score ppl school family see loser ofc end apply state university want experience social life graduate try hard get invite party ppl want school sport focus really fit group late even nerds want end stay home day watch youtube videos like pandemic hit graduation socially distance even wan na go graduation first year university ppl say first year best live parent online class even get first year experience make nmbr friends even know become future try improve self every way im shit everything stick duck genes sometimes wish could swap place someone country origin deserve opportunity life know anyone still read think ur failure know ur one

Ihats1,lonely,1620091542.0,I Still can't get over her...,"It's been about 8 months, i don't know if its even her, or the feeling of being that close to someone emotionally. 

Ever since then its been a culmination of things, my 2 extremely close friends getting jobs which with school has made it impossible to hangout with them. The other friends I have are good and they are friends, I just don't feel the same hanging out with them anymore as well.

In the beginning stages of quarantine I at least had an outlet sort of. I had discovered staying up till 3 in the morning and was using it to break down for hours on end. But with 3 days of breaking down at night and crying, I would have 1 extremely good day where I would feel amazing.                                            Now I can't even cry, no matter how hard I try. At best I just feel despair and regret in my chest. One night I drank a Bang and it made me feel horrible, I wanted to cry in the shower like the pitiful husk I have become but I ended up just standing and staring into the wall. The warm effect from the water did little to make me feel better. 

I have no motivation now, my grades are kept good just because I know Its something i should probably do but i have no will to do so. I don't want to go to college or anything, i would rather Work a retail job and live in a 1 bedroom apartment sleeping in my free time. Because that's just how bland my life has become. I can't smell either so the world seems even more grey (deviated Septum, not corona related).  

I lay in bed at night, thinking if my future will be lonely forever. Corona has sucked adding to this. Majority of people stay home at school or just don't go out that much so its been very hard just finding more friends over the course of this year. Honestly i don't know if it will get better. It's puzzling, I've never felt anything like it before, the true void of nothingness.

I want to add that when we were friends he helped me out with getting started at the gym. We motivated each other and he really helped me get the ball rolling with my gym progress. Now that he’s gone, i still go to the gym but I don’t have anyone to celebrate with when I hit new goals or am happy with my progress. No one to hype me up or push me further.

However, a complete lack of romantic relationship experience or financial stability is almost a guaranteed way to mental anguish.

There is clear evidence that earning more money does increase your happiness, up to a certain point. Once you can comfortably cover your living expenses and some luxuries, adding additional income won't add much to your overall happiness. Likewise, being broke and struggling to even make ends meet adds a significant amount of stress and anxiety to peoples' lives. 

I  would argue that relationships are very similar. Having very little to no dating/relationship experience, despite desiring it, is almost a guaranteed way to depression and stress. Just look at the Foreveralone and Incel groups; depression and suicidal ideation are common in nearly every post. There are some people who can live fulfilling lives without a relationship, but it is definitely not the norm.",everyone hear basic platitudes course true extent lot people dead bedroom lonely relationships well people climb corporate ladder leave unfulfilled however complete lack romantic relationship experience financial stability almost guarantee way mental anguish clear evidence earn money increase happiness certain point comfortably cover live expense luxuries add additional income win add much overall happiness likewise break struggle even make end meet add significant amount stress anxiety people live would argue relationships similar little date relationship experience despite desire almost guarantee way depression stress look foreveralone incel group depression suicidal ideation common nearly every post people live fulfil live without relationship definitely norm

throwaway1234719,lonely,1620360731.0,Everyone in my life but me.,"My intense feelings of loneliness stem mostly from my inability to get into a romantic relationship. 
I know I know it’s not everything and I shouldn’t base my self worth on it, but when you spend all 24 years of your life trying to find that kind of connection and only being met with rejection, it hurts. 

I do have a couple of friends I consider close. I met them way back in school and have managed to hold onto them despite my tendency to fuck up everything I touch. 

We were all single, and I took a weird comfort in that. It helped to have people in my life that struggled the same way I was. We would always complain to each other in that dumb meme-y “hell yeah brother gonna die alone 👉😎👉” sort of way. Maybe it wasn’t the healthiest way to deal, but it helped. 

Over the course of the last month or so, they’ve all managed to get into a relationship. Everyone but me. And it makes me feel like a terrible person because I wish I was happier for them, but I can’t help but feel jealous. And now whenever I try to talk to them about feeling hopeless in finding a relationship, even if I’m reaching out to them in earnest, they’ve started hitting me with the usual “hey don’t worry there’s someone out there it’ll happen when it’s meant to happen :)” bullshit. I get angry at them cause we used to jokingly say that to each other since we all knew how fake it was. But now that they’ve actually got somebody they think it’s suddenly legit advice. So now I just get to silently watch from the sidelines as my closest friends get to experience something I never will, while they treat me like every other “relationship expert” does. 

TL;DR all my friends suddenly got into relationships and now I’m even more alone than ever.",intense feel loneliness stem mostly inability get romantic relationship know know everything base self worth spend nmbr years life try find kind connection meet rejection hurt couple friends consider close meet way back school manage hold onto despite tendency fuck everything touch single take weird comfort help people life struggle way would always complain dumb meme hell yeah brother gon na die alone sort way maybe healthiest way deal help course last month theyve manage get relationship everyone make feel like terrible person wish happier cant help feel jealous whenever try talk feel hopeless find relationship even im reach earnest theyve start hit usual hey worry theres someone itll happen mean happen bullshit get angry cause use jokingly say since know fake theyve actually get somebody think suddenly legit advice get silently watch sideline closest friends get experience something never treat like every relationship expert tl dr friends suddenly get relationships im even alone ever

So anything people say about me being too young to worry or think about this stuff ain't making me feel better. Too many people have told me that and I'm stubborn. Feels like I've lived 30 years with how slow time is crawling. I can't go a single night without thinking about my exes. I can't go a single night without getting a reminder of how lonely I really am. Everyone keeps telling me it'll get better, BUT IT SURE AS HELL DOESN'T FUCKING FEEL THAT WAY. Then there's that one side of me who just wonders if I should be feeling this way, cause obviously people got it worse, at least I got a family, at least I got shelter, food, etc. I don't know if should throw my feelings away, in that case. I can't stand it. If life was a person, I'd punch it repeatedly. And very hard. Like I said, if it gets better it certainly doesn't feel that way. I'm trying to stay positive and tell myself that it won't be a bad ride all the way, but I don't know what to do anymore. Can't go one day without thinking how the people in my life have someone. But me? No one. At least no one to have a loving bond with. I'm starting to sound like a bitch, but I can't hold it all in for too long. Don't get me started on people who give you advice, but they themselves are in a relationship. Ah yes, I'm totally going to heed what they say about how it's good to be lonely or how they were in a dark spot just like me. Well good for you, because at least you don't feel alone anymore. I might have brought up the worst possible excuse, I don't know, but I can't stop thinking about it. Yeah, I distract myself with other things, but it's not gonna make the feeling go away. I've done so much shit and it makes me wonder if I even deserve one in the end. Complaining about it only adds to that theory. I think I'm incapable of loving someone in that way. I used to want to not feel shit, because at least I wouldn't feel all the bad. And now, I regret it. Surprise surprise. Maybe I don't deserve to be with someone after all. Then I'm only 16.

guiltystranger94,lonely,1620268485.0,I have no one to talk to. Do I deserve to be alone.,"I am 26 years old. I don't have any ambition. I don't know what to do. I don't have any friends. Like literary no one. The whole day I just sit in my room doing nothing. I watch some videos on the internet and that's it. This has been going on for 5 years now. The whole day I don't talk to anyone. I have never been in a relationship always wanted to but never had the courage to speak up. I always isolate myself. I am so afraid to talk to people especially in groups. I hate myself more than anyone. I can't look myself in the mirror anymore. I think I deserve this. This world is not a place for someone who is so afraid and has no ambition. I want to give up. It's so painful. It's just that I am afraid that there is nothing after life and after I die I will just stop existing. I just don't wanna feel pain anymore. 

Edit: I wanted to say thank you for everyone for talking to me and commenting on my post. Sorry I didn't reply to your comments. Got some messages too sorry again if I haven't replied to your messages. I actually hide some of the  chats thought I would talk later not realizing I can't get them back and don't remember the usernames. I was just having doubts of talking to everyone cause I have talked to some people here and after some time when they find out how depressed I am they leave. I feel more sad after that.  Don't feel bad if i didn't respond to your message. I am not that interesting to talk to. And thank you for taking time and commenting and talking to me. It means a lot to me. If you are going through the same thing or something alike you can always get better and try to be happy and have fun. Never give up and keep on fighting. It's going to be hard unbearable sometimes but just keep on fighting and moving forward. 
There's a quote I like  which I would like to share:
 Let everything happen to you ,
Beauty and terror, 
Just keep going ,
No feeling is final.

I was expressing my concerns about some tests and my friend was not having it. F's attitude was why are you worrying? relax. what's the point now?. I expressed  in agreement that there was nothing I could do about it too  but her unwillingness to understand that sometimes concerns can linger was off-putting.  I told F that while she may not care, I did because it was my responsibility to. F called me out for being hostile and rude. She really dug into me and claimed that it was the main reason she was rarely inclined to just talk to me. My blunt and 'hostile' attitude was quite a turn off on multiple occasions whenever there was a difference in opinion. This wasn't the first time F has called me out for being rude. To add to that I'm too dull for her. Anyways....

 The whole point of narrating this is to admit that I may be passive aggressive sometimes. When I'm crucified for something that doesn't strike me as deeply rude/offensive I'm hurt but even more so since I've let myself become that way. This incident is important to me because I opened up to F  about a serious personal issue a year ago....something that my own family members have struggled to voice to those close to them. So F became really important to me from that point on. But now I feel regret and confusion. Everyone has baggage but maybe it's gotten to me. Maybe I have cracked a bit. But now I look at myself and wonder who would empathize with my attitude. I think back on those who are worse and have no control and let themselves run free with their aggression.....I think about if I'm one day going to become like them. Now I wonder if I would be able to empathize with them......because I too am asking for that type of empathy........

jimmieabes,lonely,1620120169.0,How to cope with being average?,"I’m gonna start with some narcissistic background, then go into some pity afterwards. I’m 27 years old, I have a 6-figure job, a waterfront home, a big lifted diesel truck, yada yada...I can sing, work with my hands, play piano/guitar, hunt/fish, haul trailers, and a bunch of other random things. My friends and family think highly of me, and people I meet always end up saying things along the lines of “I like you, you’re a cool dude.” All this being said, I know in my head that I have a lot to offer. The problem is, I’m 5’9” (average), maybe a 6/7 in looks (average), have the personality of a piece of cardboard in that I don’t really have a lot of cool hobbies, and introverted, and get overwhelmed in crowd settings unless I’m piss drunk. I only have 2 friends, both of whom have moved away for work recently.

I have 2 brothers who are better looking than me, one is taller in addition. But the 3 of us have all suffered being single our whole lives. Not one of we have said that we love anyone romantically - nothing has worked out for us yet. I haven’t had a relationship last more than maybe 2 months. I love being alone and I thrive this way, however I’ve always wanted to get married to someone I enjoy spending time with.

This, in my head, all boils down to the fact that I’m painfully average compared to the 6’5” Chads that girls are looking for nowadays. I don’t stand out that much physically, and that’s why I can’t get the girls that I actually want to be with. In the past, with the exception of one girl, I’ve always been left for someone taller.

I got only (1) online friend that I have met almost a year ago now on twitter. They don't really want a close friendship, which is what I crave. They care, I know they do, I do too, and they often try to be here as much as they can, but they need a lot of space, are scared of close bonds, and I am often frustrated and sad because I feel like I'm always the one trying to get to know them, which doesn't seem reciprocal.

And on top of that, I have attachment issues and fears that make meeting people and making friends very painful, panic inducing and confusing.

I don't want to be alone so that's why I try to still talk to them on the daily - but it feels very lonely, and they know I'm lonely with them, but they don't know what to do even if they wish they could, and I don't want to make them uncomfortable either.

What made think of this so I felt the need to write a post here - is how I have a ""public"" twitter account with them following me among other people, and they never interact with me. My private twitter where nobody even follows me feels less suffocating because at least I don't have expectations there, I can ramble, be sad, lonely and talk to myself there. I desperately wish I had someone who wants to talk to me, who likes sharing things with me, who wants to be close - but I don't and it hurts.

DecipheredEnigma,lonely,1619921547.0,I had to breakoff a friendship with a girl whom I had feelings for while she did not feel the same way. Here's the very last thing I said to her:,"This girl was the kindest person I've met and it's also the reason I feel it might be a trait of hers that holds her back in a way because she's too afraid to let people's feeling get hurt.

We developed a friendship and to keep the story short, I fell in love with her and she kind of picked up on that. I had never talked with her in depth about this but she gave me clear signs that she is not interested. Nothing wrong with that. I understood and we continued to have conversations, give each other advice, share big moments in our lives, check up on one another regarding our physical and mental health, things like that. However, I suppose these feelings never went away and over time they yet again started to interfere with our friendship.

Below is the very last thing I texted her. Please note that she has already responded to this and acknowledged my feelings but has again made it clear that this is something she does not want to pursue but wants to keep talking with me and be friends. She reserves the right to do so and I respect that decision but sadly I had to make the call to end it.

&#x200B;

>I think I'm in love with you. I just have these feelings for you that is hard for me to explain. I think about how kind hearted and smart and lovely you are and how I see beauty in that and it makes me find you attractive. I don't know why I feel like I should tell you but I wanted to be upfront about it to you and I feel guilty for having them because I don't want to have you think about me in the same way because I think you deserve better than me. I also want to keep you in my life because you mean so much to me and despite how late or early it is you always found a way to take the time to message me. You always ask how I am doing. You give me advice and you compliment me whenever you can. Those types of things make me have these love feelings for you. And if you don't want to talk to me about this or if you never want to hear from me again I don't blame you if you don't have the same feelings. You deserve the best of love and I'm afraid that I think I am not capable of giving you what you desire in a relationship. I don't know where to go from here but my intentions was to share these feelings and not try and take a friendship to the deep end. What I mean is I still want to be your friend but I feel ashamed and incredibly stupid for wanting it to be more than that.

I know this was the right thing to do. Her fear of hurting other people's feelings forced her to want to care about me, but it's been very apparent that she does not want me any more than as a friend (it's a lot I don't want to get into). This made me feel like I was holding her back and it seems like I can't hold back these feelings. So this was the best call to make and I stand by that.",girl kindest person meet also reason feel might trait hold back way afraid let people feel get hurt develop friendship keep story short fell love kind pick never talk depth give clear sign interest nothing wrong understand continue conversations give advice share big moments live check one another regard physical mental health things like however suppose feel never go away time yet start interfere friendship last thing texted please note already respond acknowledge feel make clear something want pursue want keep talk friends reserve right respect decision sadly make call end x200b think love feel hard explain think kind hearted smart lovely see beauty make find attractive know feel like tell want upfront feel guilty want think way think deserve better also want keep life mean much despite late early always find way take time message always ask give advice compliment whenever type things make love feel want talk never want hear blame feel deserve best love afraid think capable give desire relationship know go intentions share feel try take friendship deep end mean still want friend feel ashamed incredibly stupid want know right thing fear hurt people feel force want care apparent want friend lot want get make feel like hold back seem like hold back feel best call make stand

PizzaBoy2086,lonely,1620614547.0,I am in pain,"I've been feeling pretty shitty for a while now. I would like to blame it all on the quarantine but if I'm being honest to myself and everyone else I've been feeling like crap ever since high school graduation three years ago. That night it sort of hit me that whatever goals and aspirations I had for my life were too lofty or too meaningless compared to the goals of all those people I saw walking across that stage to get their diploma. In high school, I was coerced into taking AP courses and AP tests because it was what my older sister had done when she was there, and of course she had done exceptionally well in all her courses whereas I, a supposedly smart AP student, had to get tutors for courses that everyone else in my class seemed to breeze through. I had my moments to shine in English and history courses, but I fell flat in all the rest even though my aim was to go into STEM after graduation. My hopes rested on that, that I would be able to breeze through the sciences to achieve my career goals. By the end of high school, those goals were out of reach, made so by my abysmal scores in those courses. I want to stress that I had planned out my whole life around those goals, and now I was utterly lost. 

I decided to follow my sister's route, apply for a scholarship to our local community college. I was rejected, probably because it was the first interview for a scholarship I had ever been in and was extremely nervous. She got a full ride while I got to work 30-35 hours a week at minimum wage at a Little Caesar's (the raises stopped at $8.25, by the way, would not recommend). But I powered through. I still had no plan for my future, but at least I had work and school to distract me from that rather large enigma. Of course, I fared no better in college than I did in high school, and I had to delay my graduation by a semester because I failed a Calculus course. But the final semesters were pretty okay, and I had some classes that I actually enjoyed. Y'know, until Covid reared its ugly head. Those few classes I did enjoy were snuffed out by switching to online course curriculum, which left the classes a shadow of what they once were, and I learned absolutely nothing from them for the rest of the semester. It was around this time that my dad began pestering me about the next step in my life; now that I had an Associate's, what was the plan? There was none, and for the rest of the summer last year I hemmed and hawed trying to come up with a new goal that would satisfy him. I kicked the can down the road saying that I would take a few more courses at the school to get some credits under my belt for a bachelor's degree, as my newly found career idea was to become a history teacher, the inspiration for which came from my sister of all places. He seemed satisfied with that answer but once those classes are over, I would need to apply to colleges and look for better job opportunities as my current job won't cover the cost of a single semester of any four-year school in our area, let alone room and board at one further away. 

That being said, I did hold for a long time a great joy in my life, that being my book. I had written about 70 pages of the book itself and maybe 30 or 40 more pages of stuff related to the book. Me being the goddamned idiot I am, I kept all of this on a USB stick which I lost this winter. I had poured almost five years of work into it, and now it's probably sitting in a landfill somewhere in midwestern PA. It has been hard to cope with and find the energy and tenacity required to rewrite all those pages. I might as well be putting in as much effort trying to remember what I'd written as if I were writing a dissertation. If there were one thing I'd have done in my life that was worthy of remembrance, it would have been my book. 

Such as it is, these things have weighed heavily on me for some time. Tonight was a particularly hard night. I am plagued constantly by my thoughts, and even among friends I feel ashamed and lonely. I try to convince myself that if only I had an S.O. that my porn addiction might wear off and that a relationship would satisfy most of the needs in my life. Sadly, they aren't so much ""needs"" as they are desires. I should be thankful and grateful not to be in the situations so much of the world faces. But my thanks and gratitude are nothing, they do not fill a void. I am consistently pressured by my family and my church to espouse our beliefs from the rooftops and to act Christian to those who don't return the favor to me. But if I am genuine to myself, I cannot put on a face or a front of patient loving kindness and mercy. I believe it, but I cannot bring myself to act it out, hypocrite that I am. I live in sin yet I profess the word of God. I stopped asking for forgiveness a long time ago, because I found myself returning to God every night to repent. In my mind, I justify it in that asking for forgiveness usually means you'll try to change your ways. I've tried, God knows I've tried hundreds of times. But I Just. Can't. Stop. So I stopped repenting. And my guilt is all the heavier for it. 

I'm very sorry to anyone who forced themselves to read to the end. I tend to ramble and carry on with these things forever. I very much wish there were a way to stop myself from explaining my whole life story, but I wanted to explain why I felt the way I did, what caused myself to be in my present predicament. I hope that anyone who reads this knows that I wish you well and I hope that you escape or conquer any feelings or predicaments that are weighing you down, whichever comes first.",feel pretty shitty would like blame quarantine honest everyone else feel like crap ever since high school graduation three years ago night sort hit whatever goals aspirations life lofty meaningless compare goals people saw walk across stage get diploma high school coerce take ap course ap test older sister course exceptionally well course whereas supposedly smart ap student get tutor course everyone else class seem breeze moments shine english history course fell flat rest even though aim go stem graduation hop rest would able breeze sciences achieve career goals end high school goals reach make abysmal score course want stress plan whole life around goals utterly lose decide follow sister route apply scholarship local community college reject probably first interview scholarship ever extremely nervous get full ride get work 30 35 hours week minimum wage little caesar raise stop 8 25 way would recommend power still plan future least work school distract rather large enigma course fare better college high school delay graduation semester fail calculus course final semesters pretty okay class actually enjoy know covid rear ugly head class enjoy snuff switch online course curriculum leave class shadow learn absolutely nothing rest semester around time dad begin pester next step life associate plan none rest summer last year hem haw try come new goal would satisfy kick road say would take course school get credit belt bachelor degree newly find career idea become history teacher inspiration come sister place seem satisfy answer class would need apply colleges look better job opportunities current job win cover cost single semester four year school area let alone room board one away say hold long time great joy life book write nmbr page book maybe nmbr nmbr page stuff relate book goddamned idiot keep usb stick lose winter pour almost five years work probably sit landfill somewhere midwestern pa hard cope find energy tenacity require rewrite page might well put much effort try remember write write dissertation one thing life worthy remembrance would book things weigh heavily time tonight particularly hard night plague constantly thoughts even among friends feel ashamed lonely try convince porn addiction might wear relationship would satisfy need life sadly much need desire thankful grateful situations much world face thank gratitude nothing fill void consistently pressure family church espouse beliefs rooftops act christian return favor genuine put face front patient love kindness mercy believe bring act hypocrite live sin yet profess word god stop ask forgiveness long time ago find return god every night repent mind justify ask forgiveness usually mean try change ways try god know try hundreds time stop stop repent guilt heavier sorry anyone force read end tend ramble carry things forever much wish way stop explain whole life story want explain felt way cause present predicament hope anyone read know wish well hope escape conquer feel predicaments weigh whichever come first

BongyAh,lonely,1620214148.0,Ever felt...”Different” from other people?,"I’m wanna open my mind and also not feel so alone in this aspect, so feel free to drop what has sort of separated you from other people. I’m gonna be very vague and not delve into the specifics just a brief run down but I’ll start.

I have a very small, close group of friends that I handpicked from high school to keep as friends. However, as we graduated and began to develop our lives independently, I’ve realised I’m kind of the odd one out now. When we hang out and have discussions I realise...I’m nothing like these people around me. Their hobbies, their life philosophies, their beliefs, just them as people, I don’t really match up with at all. And so after a hang out or even during a hang out, I just sit and realise, “Wow, I’m just different from these people. Completely. Nothing like them, and cause of that I can never truly be apart of them.”I’ve noticed I’ve felt this way about a lot of groups or people I’m with. I feel so radically different from a majority of groups or people that this has made me feel alone. I like my time alone, it’s probably because I feel most comforted around myself but it’s started to make me feel lonely, and truth is, I’ve been a sort of “lone wolf” or “outsider” all through high school and the only reason I “hand picked” my group of friends was because they were the only ones at the time who made me feel not alone. That’s changed however. 

Anyways, I’m curious about the other “outsider” or “lone wolf” people out there. I know I’m not the only one ironically. What truly separates you from other people? Is it a mental or physical ailment? Different mindset or personality from normal? I wanna open my mind to how many “different” people there are and what kind of “different” there are.",im wan na open mind also feel alone aspect feel free drop sort separate people im gon na vague delve specifics brief run ill start small close group friends handpicked high school keep friends however graduate begin develop live independently ive realise im kind odd one hang discussions realise im nothing like people around hobbies life philosophies beliefs people really match hang even hang sit realise wow im different people completely nothing like cause never truly apart ive notice ive felt way lot group people im feel radically different majority group people make feel alone like time alone probably feel comfort around start make feel lonely truth ive sort lone wolf outsider high school reason hand pick group friends ones time make feel alone thats change however anyways im curious outsider lone wolf people know im one ironically truly separate people mental physical ailment different mindset personality normal wan na open mind many different people kind different

Metalback72,lonely,1619882851.0,"21m, so tired. I don't want to exist but i don't want to hurt my family.","Little bit about myself. Im 21 yo male, been doing sports and martial arts since i remember myself. I was always the quiet kid but never been bullied and disliked and i believe its probably because of physical appearance and people knowing i can stand for myself if needed.

I just don't know what the problem is. I can't talk to people. Just can't. I'm always coming out as the cold/no feelings guy everywhere new i go. I had 1-2 people in my mandatory military service that i could trust and they're pretty much the only people that actually know me. But now that im discharged after 2.8 years im back to being completely alone. I found a job and already fucked every chance i had on finding friends (especially women. Many show interest but quickly realize there's something wrong with me).

My day to day life now goes like this:

Wake up 5:30am, work 7-4, lift weights when i get home 5-6pm, practice boxing in a gym 7-9pm.

I have big dreams. I want to be a champion and i truly believe i will achieve it. All those years of being alone got me working like crazy. I never quit in anything i start. Never. 

I just don't see how can i go through life living in misery inside my head. I feel like i go through everything on auto mode. Completely numb to everything. I'm just very tired..

I sometimes love to believe i was destined to be alone in order to develop the work ethic and discipline that i have and that it's a matter of time before i get everything i ever wanted. Thing is, i noticed that almost everything i want and desire eventually happens if i put my mind into it. The reason it's almost everything is because i never managed to make friends or get a girl by my side. 

There's those days when i feel unbeatable like im the best person ever. I work the hardest. I'm trying to help people with everything i have because i truly love it. Kinda fooling myself that everything is alright and maybe i can enjoy life completely by myself. And then the realization that im already 21 and haven't done anything in my life. Wasted my teenage years crying at home pretending everything is fine. Never had a friend. Never had a relationship. Touch starved. 

Thing is I'm the kind of guy who on the outside looks like i get it all easy. I've been told so many times that im good looking (from men and women, or women that told me their friend is interested). I'm very conscious about my appearance. It's important to me to always look good, be clean and smell good. When i tell people I've never been in a relationship they laugh like I'm joking with them. 

Never been handed nothing. Never asked for help with ANYTHING. Everything i have is earned with sweat and tears. It's the only reason i still have self respect. I know what I've been through to get to where i am.

luckyviolet13,lonely,1620269864.0,i wish we never met,"when i was 12, i met this boy online. we ended up getting really close, for a long time. after years, i found out he was a bit older than me. nobody had to know that though. when i found out that the person i fell hard in love with for the first time was actually not a boy, i was scared. but i told myself it was okay anyway, i really liked who i was talking to, and i understood why they may not feel comfortable in their skin. i get that. every day, we texted from sunrise to sunset, slept on skype, said goodbye into the webcam before i headed off to school. we'd be like, put the microphone on your mouth so i can hear you breathing. it felt like love. 


we planned our very first in person meeting when i was 15. she would fly from maryland to come see me, she'd rent a car, pick me up from home, and we'd spend the weekend in a hotel room. i was madly in love. she let me drive the rental truck. someone came all the way here to see me, how lucky am i. when my parents found out, the feds became involved.


shit hit the fan. it's been almost ten years, she's still in custody waiting to be deported. for so long i thought it was love. spent my savings on defending her. they added more time to her sentence when they found out we were still in communication. apparently we weren't supposed to talk. i had a burn phone from cricket. they had tapped phone lines. i hired a lawyer, dropped the no contact order. i couldn't quit her. 


we wrote letters back and forth, so many letters, confessing so much love, for so long. i'd fill the pages in my best words. i thought she was the one, that i'd move to another country to be with her. leave my family behind. this was all a mistake, i wasn't a victim. i wanted her. in the worst way.


piles of letters, filled with words i spent so much time swooning over. stamps, my name, so lovely written, sometimes with hearts decorating the envelope, sometimes with a scent i can never forget. she was proud of me and my accomplishments out here, she wasn't mad at me, she didn't hate me, it was her fault. she was doing well. she was becoming an electrician. in jail. you can do that. i know that because of her.


my heart broke when she told me that someone she had known during her stay got the letter ""R"" tattooed on their finger. that meant that someone else loved her in the way i loved her, all the while i thought her love was solely for me.


i've been depressed for almost ten years straight, bitch gave me ptsd, tried so many different meds, therapy, ketamine injections straight to the fucking vein, just trying to get her out of my head. lately, i see her in my sleep so vividly, doing so much better than me, and it hurts every time. to see her with other girls makes me so jealous in my dreams. i miss her in the worst way. i loved her something fierce.",12 meet boy online end get really close long time years find bite older nobody know though find person fell hard love first time actually boy scar tell okay anyway really like talk understand may feel comfortable skin get every day texted sunrise sunset sleep skype say goodbye webcam head school like put microphone mouth hear breathe felt like love plan first person meet 15 would fly maryland come see rent car pick home spend weekend hotel room madly love let drive rental truck someone come way see lucky parent find feds become involve shit hit fan almost ten years still custody wait deport long think love spend save defend add time sentence find still communication apparently suppose talk burn phone cricket tap phone line hire lawyer drop contact order quit write letter back forth many letter confess much love long fill page best word think one move another country leave family behind mistake victim want worst way pile letter fill word spend much time swoon stamp name lovely write sometimes hearts decorate envelope sometimes scent never forget proud accomplishments mad hate fault well become electrician jail know heart break tell someone know stay get letter r tattoo finger mean someone else love way love think love solely depress almost ten years straight bitch give ptsd try many different meds therapy ketamine injections straight fuck vein try get head lately see sleep vividly much better hurt every time see girls make jealous dream miss worst way love something fierce
DangerDaskov,lonely,1620355392.0,"""Join the military"", they said,"" you'll meet lots of people"", they said","The title is not wrong yes I did join the military. Was it the best decision? Maybe... could I have done better things in life than being all the way out here? No I couldn't this is my step towards a better life but right now I can't seem to see that. Right now I'm a young 19 year old with a bright career and a broken heart. In less than 10 days I'm supposed to graduate tech school, which is like a college where you learn about your job but you march and wear nice uniforms, and make it to my first duty station. I've fallen back many times here because this course it's hard and it's made me rethink whether sometimes I'm really happy in life and if would rather be dead. Not just that but just how damn stupid I felt when I first started all the way back in January of this year. I've made it this far but right now what's making it seem to make it hard these last 2 weeks I have left is cause I feel hard for a girl in my class. I meet her back in February and although we rarely talked she was the first one to mess with me with what I call a ""Oreo diplomacy"" in which she gives me oreo's and I don't bully her simple. Over time I grew closer to liking her for a moment in believed I would make through if I stayed with her. Although I never told her that I never dated anyone else in my life and that I've secretly been dealing with depression,stress, anxiety, and a bit of suicide I kept smiling in class,making her laught, learning about her life back home, and over all finding out how much I love her for who she is. I was willing to sacrifice everything and I mean everything to be with her. She lives in another state no problem I'll move were that way her parents don't kick her out and she becomes homeless. Like God I though why do I love and care so much about people when I don't care much about myself. Why did she have to be the only girl i liked here and why did I messed it up.... Last week I was struggling with anxiety over a test we had last Friday which I passed but the whole week I was scared I wouldn't pass and I wouldn't be able to be in her class. At this point im.only here cause of her and when I told her I liked her on Sunday it was out of desperation. You see she has never dated anyone before and her first relationship was her with some Navy cunt. She was hurt when he basically left her and all she wanted was friends to help her get over. But nope.... I had to come around and put my feelings into her. I'm not sure how long she dated him or how long ago was their breakup probs 1 to 2 months ago. But she was still hurting and it makes sense I would too if I ever dated anyone. But already last weekend I wanted to see her tell her how I felt but time and time again the weather and God were against me. Not just that but her best friend who knew about my crush with her told me to just tell her how I felt but not be surprised when she rejects me.... I'm a dumbass of all proportions instead of hanging out when she wanted to on Sunday I ran off from the group of our friends and going back to my dorms I cried off in text how I felt about her... everyone worried about me and ever her telling me they are scared I might commit suicide, which wasn't true I was heartbroken and upset at myself cause another girl rejected me. I've never told anyone about my depression or my plans to commit suicide until that day they had me sit in front of my Sergent and explain to him and my friends why I was upset. I hate them they betrayed my trust and had me send the rest of my Sunday in a hospital for mental health check up. That whole evening I spent texting them all how I didn't want to be here all I wanted was to fix what I broke and now look what I get for loving people for caring for people.... I always cared treated others with respect.... why God treats me this way. On Monday of this week I met with a physiologist but they make an appointment cause I'm about to leave. That same day I went to class no expecting much but all I saw was her all damn day she looked upset and alone... I stupidly walked up to her and tried to just ""talk"" like nothing happen and she just said she was busy... since then all week I've been feeling worst and worst I don't want to go back to that hospital or be sent there. I act normal to those friends who reported me so they think im ok when truthfully I'm not ok all week long in the same class as her pretending like we don't know each other giving her space when I want to tell her in person that I'm sorry. Fuck I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry please I wanted to just make this friendship last beyond the time we have now so when I can I can visit you or you can visit me. Fuck everyone else is tired of me saying how much I liked her and no one wants to listen to me anymore.... now it's Friday today my buddy who reported me is basically getting a position here at the dorm and so is she as like assistants to the Chaplin which I'm happy for sorta but mad cause it's like God somehow gives them both everything and I'm left here crying, vomiting for no reason cause I'm just sick to my stomach with how shitty my life is right now. My mind plays tricks on me all week we ran into each other, accidentally looked at each other, and everytime she came over to sit with our group of friends she would just sit alone or I would.leave and she would join them.... fuck I though for once in my shitty life where I grew up poor and in the ghetto fatherless and motherless. From domestic abuse to domestic abuse and to a damn homeless shelter I could finally feel proud I made it here I'm wearing this uniform but no I have no one that cares about me and those that do soon turn on me. And all did was respect others kept to myself and prayed to God I would give a better life to whatever family I could have someday. But here I am watching my buddy and her almost talk to each other and hang out like they like each other even though he says he likes someone else the way they are with each other is like they've forgotten what I went through and how I'm dealing with this is not ok. But they could careless about me they are almost like meant for each other and I hate that cause why couldn't it be me? Why did you bring them both in my life God? So I can just watch every girl that comes my way get snatched up by some other guy? So you can laugh at me for believing in true love and that I can be accepted by someone? Why why why why why why am I so horrible why couldn't she accept me what did I do wrong where did I go wrong. I want to finish my classes but it's hard when she's the one thing on my mind and everyone is just tired of seeing my gloomy face yet she pretends its all ok. She says she's an introvert and she enjoys being alone and all that but I seen a side of her where she has lied about everything.... she enjoys the company of her friends... the friends I used to have... now I dream where she us happy with someone else and me a loser who would have given up on his dreams would have gave her my whole heart and all I asked was that she became the one I deserved to have in my life the one God sent to be with me but it won't happen. Like everyone of my crushes she is special and i like her for who she is and seeing her go away from my life hurts me cause I messed up I messed up my life and every opportunity to do great things it's gone from me. This week I'm full of tests and shit so I need to focus yet with every look that gives me when she turns around and looks my direction and with every pass by and with every memory I've had with her I wonder did ever really liked me or she played with my feelings even now...
I don't ask for much but to blessed one day that someone may like me before I die that I'm not a bad person and I've never done anything bad and never will so why am I such a loser and a loner....
I don't want to date anyone in the civilian side most of yall won't be understandable when your love one is away for so long and I'm scared ill get cheated on so I have nothing in my sea of opportunities just a career that I'll do a great job at and a future with no one to share.....

I go into this spiral of shitty things the run through my mind and i don't understand why. On top of that, it's hard to even talk about them because they see so fucking rediculous, to the point people would look at you like your crazy or dumb for thinking like that. 

Sometimes, i even start to think if people really care, like everyone. Even those close to me. If I were to disappear from this earth who would give a fuck.

TryToReadThisName,lonely,1620576139.0,"Waiting for Bike Boy, a lonely love excerpt","A short story from my life and a look into my loneliness! Maybe you'll relate, maybe not. It's a bit long, and sorry for the switch in tenses. I'll edit it sometime.

May 8th, 2021

I met him yesterday. It could have been earlier, had I applied to that job. Of course, they required two more years of customer servicing that I never could have fulfilled in the six months before they opened. Still, a part of me wanted to say “Fuck it!”, and apply anyway, but I never did.

His eyelashes were so long and beautiful. I considered telling him telling him that, but for some inexplicable reason, the thought was tossed away and disregarded, so I simply thanked him for selling me my joints. When I flashed my debit card he asked me what I thought of my bank. I resorted to hating it because that's who I was in that moment. I liked doing that. I turned into a caricature of myself; taking a strong stance about something and playing it up. It's like a little conversation game, a little bait, to see if the other person bites. Keeps things interesting.

He did bite, and we talked about how shitty our mutual bank was for a few minutes. This was one of those moments where my adult life was beginning to cement and I could feel it hardening with every word. I’m turning 21, and now I'm talking about how shitty the credit union I was signed up for by my mom when I was 11 is. What’s next, dunking on the awful state of the roads we drive on? The price of meat at Costco is a solid contender as well. 

As someone who works with customers every single day, I can tell when somebody is customer servicing me, or just being themselves. In this instance, it truly felt like we connected as two individuals. Truthfully, it didn't occur to me until on my way home, that there was even a chance that he was just customer servicing me and enjoying it. These types of people are near invincible and should be regarded as psychopaths.

Now, I used to be very friendly to people in public spaces. Very accomodating to the chatty people on the bus. I could probably write a Bus Excerpts from my life, which would ALSO be a love excerpt if I'm being honest. But then, in the last stretch of the pandemic, I regressed. I no longer invite or facilitate these kinds of interactions, and I have purposefully drifted away from socializing with even the closest people in my life. But that’s not the focus here.
As we were chatting in this tiny apple-store-esque smoke shop, to my own reluctance I was slowly backing out, turning away, rocking on my feet, until eventually, I inched out the door with a meek “Thank you”. And I didn't have any thoughts about it again.

Until I was across the street and about 60 steps away. ‘I should have asked for his number!’ Ten more feet away… ‘I would never have asked for his number.’ And thus my guilt dissolved. I'm not the type of person who asks for other people's numbers. That is incredibly, momentarily, vulnerable. So I told myself I would visit the store and try again. I realized I had forgotten to buy my usual 10 pack for the week anyway. And what, exactly, was I even “trying again”? If you had asked me right after the thought, I wouldn’t have had an answer. I just knew that I needed to try.

I was, give or take, 100 feet away from my house. Absolutely winded from the climb, and a little irritable now. The last part of the journey always ends like this. I have this little set of rules for myself too. I’ll spare the details, bar this important one; Never be the first person to stop and rest. I knew there was a person on their bike trailing up the path behind me, so naturally, I knew I had to flex on them by showing them how in shape I was. I don’t smoke every single day, look at me go, I’m never absolutely winded from that two-minute uphill trail. Good job, me. 

I was doing great, less than 100 feet from my house now, when the person on the bike swerves up in front of me and yells, ""Hey! I think I just sold you weed!""
I let out an honest “HA!” and I can’t help but grin. He laughs too, and somehow we slip right back into the conversation. Much like the shitty bank, there was nothing special about the topic. But I felt us connect again. It was so easy, so uncaring and so, so vulnerable. It was like we both couldn't help but be anyone but ourselves. My cursed brain finally relieved from the thought of how much I wanted to see him again. Less than 30 seconds later, I got to the front of my house and said, ""Well, good luck riding up the rest of the mountain."" 
He gave me a shy smile and replied, ""Right, I'll leave you alone now."" Instantly I felt a pang of guilt in my chest.

I was already turned and had taken a few steps up my driveway, when I heard him say, ""Oh! You live right here."" I gave him an awkward smile. ""Yeah, I- Yeah. It was nice meeting you."" 

And as if I had imagined this entire interaction, he was gone. In all likelihood, he didn't think much of this interaction. Maybe a little, ‘Wow, such a small world!’ incredulousness, but nowhere near as monumental as whatever was going on with my brain. Or, maybe I’m wrong, but I don't think the emotions behind either of our motivations mean much of anything at this moment.

If I’m being honest with myself, I couldn't help but project my own disappointment onto him. That split-second moment where I left him feeling awkward - or unwanted- I recognize like it was my own reflection. He told me just how far away I had drifted from myself. I needed to let Bike Boy know that I can be vulnerable, that I love other people wholeheartedly and unconditionally. I needed to try.

Saturday morning was perfect. I woke up at 6am, loved the fact that I could sleep in more than I loved sleep itself, and reveled in that until about 10am. I needed an outfit conversation-worthy, I needed to smell great, and I absolutely needed to be myself. Which meant no writing down conversation beforehand, no self-conscious actions, and no expectations. Notice I said self-conscious actions, and not thoughts because that is a ridiculous demand if you are someone like me.
If this guy was working today, I had no doubt in my mind I was going to reel him in. The weird part was that I was being myself, presentation and all, but I felt like I was watching it happen. Like a director crafting each and every movement of an actor on set. Didn’t matter, helped with my confidence anyhow. 

Each step towards the goal was invigorating, I would even describe it as beautiful (I swear I wasn’t high). No hero’s journey can be complete without conflict and as usual, mine consisted of man versus self. I wish I could say that the near panic attack in the coffee shop was eye-opening. But I don’t think there’s a force on this planet that can crush my hope when it comes to romance. 

I wish I could say I ran into him on my way there because, damn, what a story that would make. But it was just a peaceful, sunny walk. I had been listening to music that was in hilarious contrast with my personality, and my style, but it made me feel like I was someone important. That’s a good tip if you’re someone like me; listen to music that makes you feel like the main character from a slice-of-life movie. 
The door to the tiny shop was opened, I slide into the room and around the wall blocking my view from the counter… and there sat a short, adorable blonde girl smiling down at her phone. I greeted her kindly and swallowed the bundle of social anxiety nerves I felt arise in my throat. It wasn't until I left the store that I felt the disappointment. Even after I had told myself not to be, and to just enjoy the act of doing this in the first place, I definitely knew how this particular ending would turn out for me. 

The thing about my pitfalls, though, is that most of them come with hope, as well. It is maybe my most unfounded, illogical feeling, but I think that's the point of hope. So really, I don’t think there is such thing as a “hopeless romantic”. All love is intertwined with hope. Not in the way that, like, you have hope in seeing the person again, or having hope that they’ll fall in love with you, but more so that loving them (even against your own will) is an act of hope. Your body, your brain chemicals, they have that shit built in whether you like it or not. It’s annoying and it makes you do dumb shit, but sometimes that dumb shit works out. Sometimes it does not.

The closer I got home, the more I wanted to wait for him. I had to sit somewhere he couldn't miss me if he were going to work, or even just into town. I don't think I've ever been happier to live in such a small place. And, yes, I realize how weird and creepy this was. It was romantic to a desperate and lonely mind. There's a two-lane road in a school zone that leads towards the way into the biggest part of town. Perfect. This is ridiculous. 

But it was the only way to repent for betraying myself. I still don’t fully feel like I want to be so open again, but I know it’s so much more natural to me than whatever I am doing now. It's the only chance I have to let this guy know I think of him as a person. I see him and I've thought about him. I want to be vulnerable, with everybody. I want everyone to be able to bear witness to my self and to judge me. I want them to know that I am my own internal source of power and no external value can be my fuel (Okay, now I was high). So I wait for him. 

It's cloudy and windy now. But the sun will also shine through occasionally. Sometimes tiny leaves blow into my face but it doesn't bother me enough to move. I sat there, writing all of this down and occasionally smoking a joint until I can bring myself to look at the time. 1:32p.m. I don't remember what time I sat down, but I left my house around eleven this morning. I’m not even disheartened by my efforts though. Whether I sat down to see Bike Boy again, or if I sat down for a different reason, it doesn’t matter. I just sat on wet grass, for like, 2 and a half hours on a Saturday by myself. It was time to head home. I could always try again when I run out of smokes.

When I think of Bike Boy now, I can see what he represents. I said he was a reflection of myself and that still rings true. But he is an example of how my past relationships have failed, of my own wrongdoings and miscalculated steps. I have a lot of thinking to get done, most of it too raw to share, but thank you for reading this far.",short story life look loneliness maybe relate maybe bite long sorry switch tense edit sometime

starzwillsucceed,lonely,1619849815.0,Beware of fake users that claim to be a young women looking for a good man.,"Yesterday night I(35m) was contacted by a user(27f) on reddit that claimed to be a young woman in the army. She consoled me with her opening remarks about my posts of being lonely she found on this sub r/lonely. I was suspicious from the start because the profile had 1 karma and was 1 year and 4 months old. 

I decided to just go with it since I am by myself most of the time since I live alone and if this user was who they claimed to be, then cool, I made a new friend. 

We talked for a bit and I then moved on to ask if she wanted to exchange pictures. We decided to use Google hangouts for this (her ask, not mine). She was really really beautiful and I was surprised that she would resort to reddit for attention from a male. But I just kept the conversation rolling while still being cautious. 

I then asked if she wanted to exchange social media such as Facebook or Instagram and she told me she had no social media at all. I was kind of surprised of this so I just wanted some way for her to verify that the pictures she was sending of herself were of her. I simply asked her to send a selfie on hangouts of her holding up three fingers while touching her nose with her middle finger. I even sent her one of me doing the same so she had something to reference. If she sent one back of her with the desired pose of the same woman in the selfies she sent earlier, then I would have been content to know that I was talking to the person she claimed to be. She said okay, but then ghosted me quickly after. 

I digress. The internet is full of people trying to get attention from us or trying to find ways to prey on lonely men AND women that will most likely lead to them asking for money or support when they aren't who they say they are.

This woman was very forward with how much she wanted a good man and had long prepared statements that seemed to be copied and pasted of her desire for a long, happy life with a man that would treat her right and love her unconditionally. I was very skeptical with this.

Mattthew261,lonely,1620180104.0,Trying not to be an incel,First this is my first Reddit post so I am not sure how this will play out since I am new to the whole reddit community so please just bear with me. I am 44 years old and worried that I am turning into an Incel. I know there are two types of incels: One who is just involuntarily celibate and one who is involuntarily  celibate and is a bitter and angry person toward women and men who are sexually active. I really do not want to become a hateful incel. I have serious confidence issue due to repeated rejections and weight issues. For a long time I thought that only assholes get the girl and that nice guys don't even finish. I no longer believe that is about being nice or an asshole. I think it is about confidence. And that is my problem. The good news is that I have began a journey of self improvement. I have began lifting weights 2 times day and bike riding 3 times a week. I have also cut down sweets and snack to a bare minimum and are starting to see results at the gym. My hope that if I  work my appearance that maybe women can look past my lack of confidence.,first first reddit post sure play since new whole reddit community please bear nmbr years old worry turn incel know two type incels one involuntarily celibate one involuntarily celibate bitter angry person toward women men sexually active really want become hateful incel serious confidence issue due repeat rejections weight issue long time think assholes get girl nice guy even finish longer believe nice asshole think confidence problem good news begin journey self improvement begin lift weight nmbr time day bike rid nmbr time week also cut sweets snack bare minimum start see result gym hope work appearance maybe women look past lack confidence

Never-a-Boyfriend,lonely,1620103047.0,"cant say this to any irl fam, sorry to dump it on you guys but i felt disingenuous not to","Someone I really respect took me to task recently, and one thing that they said was I needed to ""be my best self"" rather than the person I had become.

I love this person with my heart, no doubt but in that moment I nearrly lost it, ended up telling them that opinions were like armpits, just about everbody had one or two, and a lot of the time they just plain stink. Left the house post haste, befor I said something else stupid and regretted it nearly immidiately. I wasn't wrong, just lacking in tact, as ""my better self "" would say. 

My Better Self

They did what better selves do. Stood by the ones they cared about, no matter what, right or wrong. Loyalty was one of the few things that no one could ever take away from you, or force from you. Like respect, it is earned, and when it is mutual there can be strength like no one could comprehend. They took it to the mat, took punches took time, and and hits. They did all of the things that a better self is expected to do, and really more than that sometimes. Giving of themselves until, sometimes there was so little left they would fall into bed just long enough to start to fall asleep, when the alarm clock would remind them of their promises. Suffering in silence is the better self credo, as I'm sure you know. 

They did the thing that makes a better self into a Best Self. They gave everthing that they had, or were ever going to have. Stepped in front of the bullet with a smile on their lips. 

At least thats what I have been told. Usually just before asking why I can't be like that again. 

If I could, don't you think I would? God, I fall asleep every night begging the Universe to please, just let me wake up him. PLease... The light is gone, though. and all that remains is the shadow. I can remember most of what made him, me, me. It's just not automatic. It's studied. Out of sync with my new sense of perception. I have to work hard as hell to be kind. I cant slack up a bit, or I don't know what will happen. The worst is the feeling that I'm letting the people I care about down, just by being alive. Like I fail them every day, just by existing, but I can't blame them. 

I blame me. Him. That goody-goody sonofabitch. Who the fuck did he think he was, fucking Jesus? Asshole. ASSHOLE!!!! Evertime I watch a vid of him or see a picture, I wish I could reach through the damn screen and punch him on the damn nose. This is it.

I don’t know where to start. I just can’t keep friendships, I used to be able to years ago but since I’ve been on a downward spiral mentally everything’s been worse. I can feel the grudge and annoyance that my friend group feels towards me when I speak a word. I’m just the 3rd wheel that tries to get in on the conversations but they just push you back out.

Every single friendship I’ve been in has ended in hatred against each other. It starts off with feeling like you’re settled in, but soon enough it allll turns to shit. And I know and feel that it’s all my fault, my personality, my ugly-ness, my body, my presence makes everything worse. My presence annoys everyone, not just friends, annoys my mother, my brothers, myself.
Sick of being a socially inept, fat, ugly, dumb, stupid, piece of shit thing. I deserve nothing more than a cardboard box on the side of a road, no one would notice a thing if I was gone.

But now, I realised... I lost my way a long time ago. Crying is mercy. Mercy for yourself. If you lose that mercy, you lose your compassion towards others. 

And that is why I am now I am friendless. I suppose if I had been more open with my ""feelings"", I'd be able to bond with people better and still have friends around who genuinely cared for me.

Rasta-Grandpa,lonely,1619917073.0,Has anyone here ever seen the other side from a very dark and sad place?,"I'm going to try to keep this short but like many of us the only friends that I ever really had never were there for me and ended up just taking advantage of me whenever they had the opportunity. I've never really met another person who wasn't mainly interested in themselves. I used to be in a band but that fell apart because my bassist ended up being one of those toxic people.

I utilized COVID for some personal self-development, I've landed myself a pretty cool job but my co-workers are mostly remote.  I am in a much better position in my personal life as opposed to my social. I am basically a quiet monk and nobody ever notices me. I am even involved in 2 volunteering organizations and even that hasn't granted me any friends or relationships either.

Everyone including my therapist just tells me to just wait, and that my time will come. I don't believe that. I think removing myself from my social circles before COVID has doomed me forever.

I'm starting to see a lot of things changing and people getting vaccinated, being excited to party in the summer. What am I doing? I take a step outside and it's just as shitty as it was on the inside. I still don't have friends. I still haven't dated anyone in 2 years. I'm 25 and I only make $15 for now, but I'm busting my ass at my job and trying to be creative.

Just because the vaccines are out doesn't mean we're returning to any semblance of normal anytime soon. The lingering anxiety will remain there for probably the next couple years to come, as I don't want to bother anyone or assume myself in anyone's personal space. I just want good for everybody. But I've only ever gotten taken advantage of. No one has ever had my back or loved me unconditionally besides my mom maybe. My sister is back home from her first year college and she hangs out with friends EVERY DAY while I stay inside. God fuck it's kinda hard to write this.

This is probably one of the darkest and most depressing periods I've ever experienced in my life. The isolation is actually killing me, and I think I can feel it in my body. Every day I carry death close to me, right by my side. It's always on my mind, and I don't want to die, but I feel like I'm going to die very soon. I'm in a place where it doesn't feel like my life was cut out for this, and that I need to either burn out slowly like a candle or just end it ASAP.

I'm willing to wait if the summer makes things any better, but I'm not expecting anything. Whenever any semblance of an opportunity appears (its never the ideal one) I never allow myself to let it take place in my mind. I'm stuck in the all-too-familiar rock-bottom depression for me to actually feel happy. It feels almost like an oxymoron; I can't possibly feel happy, because the world is full of suffering and misery. I'm probably somewhat sabotaging myself here, but I want to make friends, I just don't know what else to do next. I sob to myself every other night. I seriously just want to be free again.

I just wanted to ask, has anyone ever taken themselves out of this even temporarily and was able to feel happy again? Does it just take time to get used to or is it something that just hits you and then suddenly you're ok again? Why is everyone so excited for things to go back?

_Cheeseburger_cake_,lonely,1620146715.0,Rather long boring story of lonliness,"Ok, so first of all I am not the best writer and I apologize for any grammar issues and spelling errors. I am also not the best at getting my point across or sharing my feelings and this will be a long read. Feel free to read or not. Just felt the urge to vent / share and figured I would post it here. NOTHING I am writing is an attempt for pity. I just wanted to share my experiences and maybe it can help someone else out and maybe it will help me a bit to share instead of keeping it bottled up. With that out of the way let's begin. 


Currently I am a 36 year old lonely male.

When I was 17 I watched on TV the events of 9/11 as many others did. Up to this point I had no idea what I would do with my life. As I watched something clicked inside of me. It was a resolution. I would bring the pain they gave us americans that day to them. My naive 17 year old self thought. Promptly I reported to the closets USMC recruiting depot. Not long after I was on my to Paris Island. (not going to indepth here) After basic training I was quickly sent to Iraq in 2003 for my first combat tour. After this tour I came back and was given 45 days of leave which I used to go back home. At this point I was blissfully unaware how this war would effect me and my relationships. While home on leave I met a southern belle and we dated long distance for about a year after my leave ended. At which point we got married. Soon after that I was deployed to Iraq a second time. 

During this deployment I was involved in an ied explosion which it seemed I escaped relatively unharmed except for some back pain. Once my deployment ended I spent the last of my time with my wife before finally moving back home. 

Once back home though our relationship fell apart I started to have night terrors etc and on top of that I was having a hard time finding work and going to college. Our relationship ended in a divorce for no true reason that comes to mind. Which is funny because we still talk to this day. It just didn't work out. 

Finally I finished college and got a decent job. While working this second job I met my second wife. We fell in love quickly (I am a romantic for better or worse. I once bought out an entire restaurant for a private date. ) We got married and had two kids. Life was good. I had good job, a stay at home wife a picket fence etc. Only thing is my back was hurting more and more and the night terrors continued. (25 around this time)

One year after our second kids birth died in their sleep at night one week before Christmas. Unopened presents and full stockings etc... Death certificate listed it as unknown and this is where everything started to go ""wrong"" my life. my wife and I  grew distant. I ended up getting hurt at work. Badly. I was pulled from a utility pole by a logging truck not paying attention. They never found the driver. I was in the hospital for about three weeks. 

It took another 9 months to recover enough to get back to work. Now I noticed my back still hurts and I'm getting this weird tremor in my right hand. I would ignore it another year or so. At this point I am still married with my second wife and we still had our one child. 

Soon after I returned to work I went to see a back specialist at which point I'm told after an mri my back has a crushed vertebrae that looks like it's been that way awhile. After some investigation we concluded it happened when I was in the ied explosion. After some surgery my work laid me off / fired me for being absent from work for so long. My wife left then too the day after Christmas. A really hard time of year for me. (30 around this time)

Now forced to sell my home and deal with a second divorce I move in with my friend from work paying him very little in rent. Meanwhile my ex is now dating again and looks extremely happy it's soul crushing. I also work odd jobs like delivery etc as looked for more stable work. 

The hand tremors I had start to get worse by 32-33. So I start to go see nuerologists at which point I get diagnosed with early on-set Parkinson's the doctor says it's likely due to chemical exposure in iraq. (burn pits. Ewww)

Which brings me to today. 36 haven't dated since my divorce. Haven't worked in 4-5 years due to the Parkinson's and left over effects of back surgery etc and worsening ptsd (6-7 years ago) Living a lone and occasionally seeing my kid when able too. 

Even though I feel very lonely often and my body is slowly losing control of it's self I can't sleep more than a few hours at a time, can't really exercise like I would want to, become a shut-in and am keenly aware no women would ever want a man with my issues I'm still thankful and strive to make myself happy. 

I'm thankful I get to spend time trying to learn new skills, I don't get nagged, I have a beautiful kid,ore time for hobbies, got lucky and don't really have to have a job, and I am still alive

I guess my point is life can be very cruel and very hard but if anyone out there is drowning in despair and lonliness find something to make yourself happy don't rely on a boy or a girl to make you happy. Make yourself happy first so if you do find someone your not super reliant on them and can also make for a better relationship. In my opinion. 

Then if that boy or girl leaves you can coupe with it. Try to make a few friends even if it's just internet friends.  

I still hope someday I may find someone to put up with me and my issues but if I don't that's ok too. 

I just felt like sharing and venting a bit. If you read all of this thank you and have a great day. I skipped over a lot of details and events but if I covered everything this post would be a book. Lol.

Echo-Blank,lonely,1620546199.0,My computer screen and I,"My computer is never off anymore. Every minute I’m home, I’m going from Discord server to Discord server, google tab to google tab. It used to be video games but quite honestly I’ve grown bored of all my games as of late. They’re just— not fun. When I’m not on the computer, I’m watching Youtube, researching random shit, or browsing Reddit. That’s my daily life. I’m not saying I regret it, or don’t enjoy doing these things, but...

I want friends to go play sports with. Go on little adventures, eat out every once in a while, or just go somewhere nice to talk and hang out. When your only interest is computers and you have bad social anxiety your environment becomes very familiar, very quick. I would say I care more about my desktop environment than I do my room, because that’s where I spend the most time looking. My PC is customized more than you’d believe. Most of the programs on startup, I’ve written the software myself. I enjoy employing automation in every way I can.

Right now one of my main goals is to learn everything I possibly can about computer hardware and software systems. I just want to be really really good in one area of expertise. I read paper after paper, article after article, just going down the rabbit hole, taking notes until I’m satisfied with my understanding of the subject. As I learn more, I also find myself going back to previous notes and refining them through another rabbit hole. Sometimes I’ll have projects in mind to keep my rabbit holes somewhat on track and to have a clear purpose, but it’s usually not going to stop me from sidetracking laterally for god knows how long lol

It gets really difficult at times to keep my motivation to learn. I yearn for someone to talk with about something I made or learned that day. I want to swap ideas back and forth. I also want to be introduced to new interests every once in a while. Loneliness is probably the most efficient way to keep me in bed, or idly listening to music and watching my custom-made audio responsive background, or have my head on my desk, wondering what I’m doing all this for anyway.",computer never anymore every minute im home im go discord server discord server google tab google tab use video game quite honestly ive grow bore game late theyre fun im computer im watch youtube research random shit browse reddit thats daily life im say regret enjoy things want friends go play sport go little adventure eat every go somewhere nice talk hang interest computers bad social anxiety environment become familiar quick would say care desktop environment room thats spend time look pc customize believe program startup ive write software enjoy employ automation every way right one main goals learn everything possibly computer hardware software systems want really really good one area expertise read paper paper article article go rabbit hole take note im satisfy understand subject learn also find go back previous note refine another rabbit hole sometimes ill project mind keep rabbit hole somewhat track clear purpose usually go stop sidetrack laterally god know long lolit get really difficult time keep motivation learn yearn someone talk something make learn day want swap ideas back forth also want introduce new interest every loneliness probably efficient way keep bed idly listen music watch custom make audio responsive background head desk wonder im anyway

I think of the people I used to have in my life, the people that didn't make me feel alone, and I wonder if they think of me when they're trying to fall asleep. 

I try to forget about them, find new people, but since I have yet to find someone to make me less lonely it's hard. 

The other day one of the people I'm trying to forget followed my Instagram. I texted them and never got a reply. It keeps me up wondering what that was about because they clearly stated that they wanted nothing to do with me. 

Tonight as I lay in bed hoping to never wake up again I stumbled into the reddit about of someone who I have not thought about in a month and now I can't help but think about them. I was already having a hard time because I'm about to celebrate the loneliest birthday I've ever had and that just plunged me into the depths of he'll.

13547USERNAME,lonely,1620074678.0,"The reason depressed, suicidal or lonely people don’t get help is NOT because of the stigma against depression. It’s because nobody gives a fuck about their problems","Every time a person who is depressed or lonely tries to get help, people trivialize their problems and gaslight them and teach them comforting lies and false hope, only for us to realize in the end they lied. 

Every time we talk to someone, they minimize our problems. You are 30 and never had a gf/bf and never could date or lose your virginity. They say “tHeRe’S mOrE tO LiFe tHaN sEx aNd dAtInG” and these are the people who get depressed over a breakup or who won’t date a virgin because they cannot handle teaching you or who get dates regularly and don’t know what it’s like in your shoes

You tell them you never made friends and are socially isolated and others have pics of them doing fun stuff online they say “but but those are just the highlights” even though their highlights are far more exciting than anything that occurs in your life and then they say “BuT yOu dOn’T kNoW wHaT gOeS oN iN tHeIr LiFe hOw Do yOu kNoW ThEy’Re hApPy?” And how do you know they’re just as miserable? Some might be miserable but a majority I’m sure are pretty happy and definitely way happier than an extrovert who is socially isolated with an uneventful life.

They tell us that friends, social events etc aren’t that fun and we aren’t missing much even though people throw these events to celebrate special holidays or their birthday. For example, if parties are boring, why do people go them all the time including after trying them out for the first time? If they sucked they wouldn’t go over and over again? Why would they throw them when celebrating a holiday or graduation or their own birthday? If hanging out with your friends isn’t so fun why do people do it so much? If concerts and bars aren’t fun why do people go to them all the time? 

Instead of helping you make new friends or find a partner or go to a fun event like a concert they just trivialize your problems.

These are the same people who went insane under quarantine. At least they had friends and a social life prior to covid while a lot of people here never did. And despite being unable to handle the tip of the iceberg of what socially isolated people dealt with they gave the audacity to trivialize our problems 

This is why depressed or lonely or suicidal people don’t get help. Even if they knew you won’t stigmatize them for being depressed they still won’t talk to you knowing you’ll gaslight them or trivialize their problems. 

This is why the suicide rate and depression rate has skyrocketed despite campaigns and people “trying” to prevent suicide/depression.",every time person depress lonely try get help people trivialize problems gaslight teach comfort lie false hope us realize end lie every time talk someone minimize problems nmbr never gf bf never could date lose virginity say theres life sex date people get depress breakup date virgin handle teach get date regularly know like shoesyou tell never make friends socially isolate others pics fun stuff online say highlight even though highlight far excite anything occur life say know go life know theyre happy know theyre miserable might miserable majority im sure pretty happy definitely way happier extrovert socially isolate uneventful life tell us friends social events etc fun miss much even though people throw events celebrate special holiday birthday example party bore people go time include try first time suck go would throw celebrate holiday graduation birthday hang friends fun people much concert bar fun people go time instead help make new friends find partner go fun event like concert trivialize problems people go insane quarantine least friends social life prior covid lot people never despite unable handle tip iceberg socially isolate people deal give audacity trivialize problems depress lonely suicidal people get help even know stigmatize depress still talk know gaslight trivialize problems suicide rate depression rate skyrocket despite campaign people try prevent suicide depression

MessiahJohnM,lonely,1619975283.0,"If you had a new neighbor, how would you want them to try and meet you?","Hey all (TLDR at end!!):

I’m moving to a new complex in a few weeks and really want to get to know my neighbors...and even make friends with one or two if I get lucky. There’s no way over 100 people can live in one space and  none of them will be both friend worthy (and open to a friendship). 

Anyway, I’ve always been happier at poorer complexes, as the people were more often smokers AND open to friendships. I was a smoker for a couple years (half a pack a day) and when I quit people who smoked were still just as open to friendship.

With smoking being banned at most places these days, when people would likely be healthier smoking a bit and having social bonds (loneliness is worse than smoking like half a pack a day according to science), I don’t know how to meet people. I’m very open, friendly, and when I am in spaces where talking to others is encouraged (the climbing gym for ex), people like me very easily and we get along.

Making friends with neighbors is crucial for my own mental health ((probably most of us tbh)), as every time in my life I’ve felt truly happy, there was friendship and connection with people who lived close to me and/or with me. I feel like many people are depressed now *because* we lack connection with our physical surroundings and the people closest to us physically, as this is something extremely important to being a social mammal. The closer the physical proximity to a friend, the more likely that relationship is to be maintained.

TLDR:
If you had a new neighbor happy to get to know people, how would you want them to say they genuinely want to get to know their neighbors?",hey tldr end im move new complex weeks really want get know neighbor even make friends one two get lucky theres way nmbr people live one space none friend worthy open friendship anyway ive always happier poorer complexes people often smokers open friendships smoker couple years half pack day quit people smoke still open friendship smoke ban place days people would likely healthier smoke bite social bond loneliness worse smoke like half pack day accord science know meet people im open friendly space talk others encourage climb gym ex people like easily get along make friends neighbor crucial mental health probably us tbh every time life ive felt truly happy friendship connection people live close feel like many people depress lack connection physical surround people closest us physically something extremely important social mammal closer physical proximity friend likely relationship maintain tldr new neighbor happy get know people would want say genuinely want get know neighbor

I just want to die. I'm almost 22, and I never knew what happiness and friendship ever were. I am, without a doubt, the most unwanted person alive. I've been stacking lethal doses of different medicines for 2 years, but couldn't do it, just clinging onto any glimpse of hope. but i can't do that anymore. I'm tired. I'm tired of being shunned away by everyone so violently. I'm tired of being silent all the time. i'm tired of thinking about past trauma, and how the future won't be any different

it hurts how others can simply just be loved, and I hate myself for thinking like this. and here I am, again, one step away from ending my non-life, thinking about who could possibly care. and there is absolutely no one, outside of my family. I'm trapped in my pile of misery, disfigured by my own blood, and I have no one to even turn to. not that I think I deserve a friend, I never did. but why do I have to go through all of this unloved and unwanted?

LordJameson7,lonely,1620356177.0,I feel like I'll never find anyone loyal,"A little background: I'm a 26 year old guy that lives in a somewhat rural part of Pennsylvania, a small town about an hour away from the big city, but very little in terms of a local dating pool. I can't find anyone local willing to even go out with me, so I've been dating girls about an hour away, thinking they'd be better, but it's the same old 2 dates, take advantage of my wallet, then ghost me. I'm honestly tired of this ghosting game, I'd rather someone honestly tell me they don't like me/hate my guts than pretend to like me and *poof* gone, at least I'd have some closure or an idea of what I did wrong/can improve upon, but when I get ghosted I have no clue, I'm just the same old me that isn't getting anywhere with dates, still feels lonely in the presence of others because I have yet to form a true connection or bond with a date in recent years. I know it's 100% my fault, I'm somewhat short, don't have ripped abs, wasn't a jock in high school (still am a nerd). I'm just a geeky computer guy, girls naturally never really took an interest in me all throughout my life until after college, and I was so God damn lonely, mentally broke down and had to go to the guidance counselor so many times just because I felt so alone and frustrated, still go to therapy today, but I'm no less lonely. I've been with 2 women officially, and 2 unofficially, I have very little dating experience for my age, most people get their first sweetheart at like 12 or 13, I lagged 10 years behind, and think I still do socially/dating wise, I'm now at the level of a high schooler, but am dating in an adult world, I'm guessing 99% of everyone has more experience than me, I have no game and it sucks. I just wish I could find my ""soul mate"" and get over all this dating shit, it's tiring, I'm lonely, and I've been alone way too God damn long for my liking, something about myself needs to change, because I'm obviously repelling women away for some reason I'm oblivious to, and I'd like to know what it is, I'm pretty good looking (aside from the height) and mostly well mannered, though can be a hothead sometimes, but I've made a lot of progress in therapy with my anger problem and it's rarely an issue anymore. Something else is hurting my game, or maybe it's just the lack thereof, but I have had sorta successful relationships before and I did it just fine back then.

AFatPandasaur,lonely,1620448032.0,I used to love the weekend,"I’m almost 30. I used to love the weekend. I’d get to spend my time with my friends and do whatever we pleased. Early on it was video games or being out at night playing crazy hide and seek games in the dark. Later it was going the bars or going to concerts or festivals or just relaxing in our own apartments doing whatever we wanted. I’ve had multiple relationships with girls whom I’ve truly loved. With a special someone it really didn’t matter what I did, I was just happy to be with them.

My “friends” were very toxic and abusive. It took many years before I realized that and we were no longer in each other’s lives for various reasons. I still kept one best friend though from that group. He fell to drugs and chose shittier people over me. Those same people treated me like shit and he always said “it’s just a joke man, you gotta lighten up.” If that’s how they always treated me, then it wasn’t a joke. He never got that. 

I became friends with others and was in a couple different groups of people. All of whom were also very rude to me and abusive but again to me it seemed like being picked on and treated like that was just how it worked, even though no one else in the group would ever get it as bad or as consistently as me. I couldn’t believe it was happening again. 

There was a girl who I used to have a crush on in high school and we became life long friends later. Recently she has completely stopped being my friend over something so petty, it just leaves me dumbfounded.

Oh, the relationship thing? Every single girl besides one cheated on me or lied to me or abused me emotionally. I haven’t been on a proper date in a very long time. I’ve tried online dating and it’s awful. Nothing is real. There is no emotion and no one cares. Men are a commodity for women on dating apps and thusly we are expendable and replaceable. 

I’ve been called handsome and very good looking. When asked, people have said “oh, afatpandasaur? He’s one of the nicest and kindest guys I’ve met.” I genuinely care for others and their well being. I want people to be happy, even compete strangers. I will go out of my way to help someone if I am able, no hesitation.

Yet, I have no friends. None. They all have left me. I stood up for myself and people didn’t like that. I’ve tried reaching out and nobody cares. As I said before I’ve tried online dating which seems to be the only avenue for dating and it’s demeaning and leaves me feeling so much worse. 

Due to life issues and my depression and anxiety and stupid financial decisions I’m currently living with my folks since living on my own would be so expensive I’d never be able to save money and get ahead in life. I tried and that was awful too. I’ll eventually have enough to buy a house for myself but even now the market is getting worse and worse.

My job doesn’t care if I live or die. They are awful. I work in the trades and my only coworker I see in a daily basis is a selfish racist bigoted asshole who encourages civil war. I can’t leave yet cause I don’t have another’s years worth of experience under my belt.

I’m writing this because I guess I just want my story to be heard. I want it to be heard cause maybe you know someone in your life who may be lonely. Someone who used to love the weekend. If this can spark the light that someone sees to save them, even just one person, then I feel my pain was worth it.

It’s actually something I tell myself to make myself feel better. “I’m going through this pain, this hollowing and numbing loneliness, these betrayals of love and friendship, so that someone else doesn’t have to.” To me, that makes this worth it to some degree.

This has devolved into the ramblings of a very very very sad and lonely soul. The pain has hollowed me out and I feel my strength waning. Therapy and medication didn’t help. My previous passions are lackluster. They only serve to hurt me more because I can’t even enjoy them. I ache. It won’t stop. The pain won’t stop. Not even my mom can make me feel better. 

Please please please, if you have gotten this far, fear not for me. Do not feel sad or sorry. Do not apologize or try to understand more. I have accepted my fate and while I’m still angry, I’m slowly making peace with it.

This is all I ask. 

Be kind. It’s quite literally the easiest thing you can practice. If you see someone or think someone is lonely. Reach out. Try. You may save a life.

Every single person is fighting a battle that you know nothing about.

Be kind. Enjoy your weekends.",im almost 30 use love weekend id get spend time friends whatever please early video game night play crazy hide seek game dark later go bar go concert festivals relax apartments whatever want ive multiple relationships girls ive truly love special someone really matter happy friends toxic abusive take many years realize longer others live various reason still keep one best friend though group fell drug choose shittier people people treat like shit always say joke man got ta lighten thats always treat joke never get become friends others couple different group people also rude abusive seem like pick treat like work even though one else group would ever get bad consistently believe happen girl use crush high school become life long friends later recently completely stop friend something petty leave dumbfound oh relationship thing every single girl besides one cheat lie abuse emotionally proper date long time ive try online date awful nothing real emotion one care men commodity women date apps thusly expendable replaceable ive call handsome good look ask people say oh afatpandasaur hes one nicest kindest guy ive meet genuinely care others well want people happy even compete strangers go way help someone able hesitation yet friends none leave stand people like ive try reach nobody care say ive try online date seem avenue date demean leave feel much worse due life issue depression anxiety stupid financial decisions im currently live folks since live would expensive id never able save money get ahead life try awful ill eventually enough buy house even market get worse worse job care live die awful work trade coworker see daily basis selfish racist bigoted asshole encourage civil war cant leave yet cause anothers years worth experience belt im write guess want story hear want hear cause maybe know someone life may lonely someone use love weekend spark light someone see save even one person feel pain worth actually something tell make feel better im go pain hollow numb loneliness betrayals love friendship someone else make worth degree devolve ramble sad lonely soul pain hollow feel strength wan therapy medication help previous passions lackluster serve hurt cant even enjoy ache stop pain stop even mom make feel better please please please get far fear feel sad sorry apologize try understand accept fate im still angry im slowly make peace ask kind quite literally easiest thing practice see someone think someone lonely reach try may save life every single person fight battle know nothing kind enjoy weekend

Medical-Implement-91,lonely,1620435210.0,Storey of my life,"I've felt lonely my whole life. Every small up - not that there have been many - has come with a big crashing down. I can't trust people and haven't been able to for many years now.

OK, I'm going to give my life storey because I need to get it off my chest. If at least one person takes the time to read it, it would mean alot to me. I'm 37 by the way. 

When I was a child, I could never make friends. I was shy and awkward, and I would cry at what most people would say is nothing. I was very lonely. I was like this right up until I was about 15. I know right? A little old to be so sensitive. I felt excluded and bullied constantly. Then I snapped one day and decided to start giving people crap. Anyone that came my way got it. Not a healthy choice right? But there it is. Why is it people only respect selfish assholes? I just want one person in life I can share things with and be myself.

This harder but disrespectful attitude led to me forming a few relationships (friends). I hung around with them. We went out cycling for fun and shared our interests. But then my true sensitivity and quietness eventually started to show, and they left me to hang out with other people. I was devestated. I felt lonely again. I would call them to hang out and chase them around like a fool. And if I pestered them enough, sometimes they would. I couldn't see that they had me dangling like an idiot. Then I met my girlfriend through one of my so called friends.

I was 17 and she was 15. After a couple of weeks I very stupidly accidently told this girl I loved her. I guess I felt desperate to have someone in my life that would not leave me. She said it back and I promised her I would never leave her. We stayed together for 12 years... Out of obligation to a promise. Until I was 29. We didn't really love each other.

At the start of the relationship we started smoking weed. All of my so called friends smoked it and a couple of years after I got with my girlfriend they all got married moved away and had kids. Lucky them. I felt abandoned. I still do, and it's been 20 years. I remember each and every person that has ever hurt me like it was yesterday. None of these friends ever bothered to contact me again. I assume they stopped smoking weed. I guess I only smoked it for so long because psychologically it was the only thing getting me by. I know that's not true but I was mentally addicted. It makes you think you're happy at the time, until it wears off and you need more. It just adds to your depression. 

The girlfriend never once again said she loved me during our entire 12 year relationship and again, like the fool I am, I chased her around and kept trying to have conversations that actually meant something to me for 11 years. She would say all the wrong things and repeatedly broke my heart. So we argued. The whole time she just got high, avoided talking about anything that mattered to me, and slept constantly. She wasn't in the relationship at all. Not caring. Like always, I felt alone the whole time.

Near the beggining of the relationship we moved in together and I met a guy who smoked weed too, but he had anger issues, got into fights all the time, and actually spoke proudly of it. I pretended to be like him so I could have a friend. We got to spend the next 11 years sharing our problems with each other. In a way I feel lucky to have had that, but it was at the cost of my integrity. I was being fake and all I wanted to do deep down was quit smoking weed and be myself again. Truthfully I'm gentle. So I still felt alone inside the whole time.

During this relationship my girlfriend would constantly slag off my family and actually turned me against them. I was a fool. Then in 2007, my father died of lung cancer. He was only on his late 50's. It was a two year battle with two operations and in the end he suffocated. He was honestly on my side in life. My girlfriend was not supportive about his death at all. You always have to deal with your problems yourself. Nobody really cares. 

Just before my father got lung cancer my mother left my father for someone else and I could not understand why. I watched as she visited the house every day giving him false hope for two years and all the while he was deteriorating with cancer. My father would beg me sometimes not to let her in the house anymore if she came, because she was wearing him down. But the house was half hers and I couldn't stop her. My father was so strong and I watched him become so weak. I hated her for it. 

After my father died my younger brother was left in the house alone and was obviously devestated at such a young age, so I pushed down my own feelings and moved in to take care of him. I never even cried. My girlfriend was not happy despite the fact that she got to move from a tiny flat into a largish house and the bills would be alot cheaper. She just hated my family and I hated my mother for what she had done to my father. 

I argued with my mother for the next few years while I lived there. I wanted to move out. The same thing all the time. I would say. 'You have to move in with your son, so I can have my life back. I've given up my life for you.' She flat out refused the whole time acting like she was doing me some big favour. 

Throughout my entire life I had no money. The debt piled up and in the end I declared bankruptcy. Me and my girlfriend never had any money despite us both working full time. I've lived on the edge my whole life. This only added to the pressure between us. I started work as a delivery boy and met a guy that worked there who would bring weed to the house. 

Then when I was 29 my girlfriend finally left me. All the misery and loneliness in my life hit me at once, and I cried uncontrollably for weeks. All day, every day and in my sleep too. Yes, it's possible. I would wake up with the pillow soaked with tears. Everyone leaves me and I leave everyone.

Then one day I found an app filled with quotes from Buddha and one stood out to me,

""If you find no one to support you on the spiritual path, walk alone. There is no companionship with the immature.""- Gautama Buddha

This got me thinking how I had lived my whole life in service to others and got nothing but misery and loneliness for it. So I stopped talking to people. I mean everyone. Even the people at my workplace. I thought if no-one could get in my head and control me, then no-one could hurt me. Believe it or not I didn't speak to a soul for the next two years or three years. And guess what? I got stronger. That's right! It turns out you DON'T need people. I finally stopped crying and I stopped smoking weed and I took care of myself better and my confidence increased. I took my life back. But it didn't come without any downsides.

You see, because I wasn't speaking at work they started bullying me. Some of them would call me a bastard, some of them let the air out of my tires, and the guy that used to bring me weed burgled my house twice. I had evidence that it was him. They even employed a prostitute and tried to trick me into dating her. It was awful.

Then one day out if the blue some police officers suddenly showed up at work and arrested me. Apparently the boss there had told them that I had gone insane and started busting the place up and intimidating all the staff. It wasn't true of course. The next thing I know they are taking me to a hospital and accusing me of having schizophrenia when I was really just trying to protect myself from people.

They put me on a two weekly injection. What they thought it was doing I have no idea, because I still refused to talk to anyone. You see I felt so much stronger alone. While I was like this my emotions were stable as a rock.

Work fired me and I could not afford to pay the mortgage on my mother's house anymore. She would send me big abusive messeges blaming me and saying 'now I have to sell the house because of YOU' even though her house should have been her own responsibility. 

The house was sold and I had nowhere to live. I slept in my car for  a while then my mother decided to take me into her spare room even though she was not allowed because if her landlady. I supposed it was nice of her, but I did not trust her after everything and I still did not speak a word to anyone. I felt peaceful inside. For the first time in my life I didn't need people.

The next thing I know my mother gave me £38,000. You have to understand throughout her entire life she always tried to buy my affection. She even stole me away from my father when I was young by bad mouthing him, and buying me sweets and toys. I was grateful for the money but I still didn't speak to her. You see everyone around me, including her, acted as if I had something wrong with me. Like in was sick in the head. I can assure you I have always been fully aware of my surroundings and actions. The more you tyy to defend yourself against people, the worse people accuse you, and the worse things get, so I continued my silence.

I used the money to settle my new debts. I redid my school leaving qualifications and finally got worthwhile grades. I got my big motorbike licence and enjoyed a 2013 Suzuki bandit for a year or so... But I became depressed and felt alone again because of it all. I must have felt like I didn't earn it or something, and everyone was putting the pressure on me because of not talking and giving me dirty looks. It seemed to me like the whole city had heard shit about me... So I came off the medication and skipped the country. And everything was fine. 

I lived in Japan for five months and learned some Japanese in a school. I felt right at home since most people there are too shy to talk to each other anyway. I felt strong again. I began to speak to people. I trusted them. They were considerate of my feelings, they never did a thing to inconvenience me, and they never once hurt me. I got along with all the people I spoke to. For the first time in my life I felt at home and peaceful. Seriously, it's like they did something to instill my heart with strength.

Then when my funds started to get low I moved to a small town in northern Spain for two months and sent for my qualification certificates through the post. I planned to try and get a job in Spain. When I couldn't get one and all I had left was airfare back to the UK, I realized I would need benefits to survive.

But I didn't want to go back to my home city. I decided to go to London instead and live in hostels until I could get a job. The second I applied for benefits though the police found me and put me straight back on medication and straight back in a hospital again. For this reason I don't trust shrinks, and I don't trust the police. They can't see the truth. They don't comprehend. 

I have explained everything as calmly as I can to these people on more than one occasion. As far as they are concerned me trying to defend myself means I definitely must have schizophrenia.

I would blame my country but it couldn't be that right? It's because of my so called, friends, family, and coworkers from my hometown. The people who only pretend to care about me, and only pretend to have my best interests at heart.

Anyway after coming back, my emotions had been fortified, and because of the medication, I went on benefits... Which have turned out to be more than I ever got on a minimum wage job. That's totally not right is it...? But it's true. 

I have felt stable for the last couple of years and been doing better than ever living in a flat alone, up until about two months ago. You see, the medication I'm on has brought me a variety of negative mental and physical conditions. Depression, foggy mind, liver damage, incredibly stiff and inflexible muscles, weight gain, and high cholesterol.

Also,my mother's boyfriend had been pestering me saying if I didn't make friends or get a girlfriend I would become miserable and lonely. After a while he started to get into my head. Then one day I joined a couple of new groups on Facebook and suddenly started receiving hundreds of friend requests every day. I don't know why but when I started getting hundreds of message I thought maybe this is a good opportunity to try and find some trustworthy friends.

I fell for it again. Trusting people. I spoke to dozens of people and they all tried to scam me out of my money. One girl, from China, gained my trust by being really caring and loving, but at the same time asking me for really expensive gifts off a really specific website. And the worse part is, I actually love her because no-one has ever treated me so well. I think she'll leave me when she figures out she can't get anything else out of me.

For the past twenty four hours I have just been crying again and I'm afraid I'm going to become like I was before when I felt so lonely and cried for weeks.

Why is it that if I don't talk to people I feel strong? But when I do I can't stop crying? It's people themselves that make me feel alone and depressed, not people that help me! Is that normal?",felt lonely whole life every small many come big crash trust people able many years ok go give life storey need get chest least one person take time read would mean alot nmbr way

1mJust1mbtw,lonely,1620578291.0,I turned 18 today and i wanted to commit suicide,"Hi everyone, i’ll try to make this short.

I turned 18 today, and nobody remembered about my birthday. None of my classmates, none of my teammates. Literally nobody, cause I have nobody. Never ever had a single friend. Just one, and he turned out to be toxic for me... because of his looks, every girl that saw him instantly wanted his number, or at least stared at him. Last summer, we spent 1 month at the sea together, and i couldn’t handle it after a week, cause every time i was the ignored one. 

Now, he found a perfect girl and they’re planning to go on a cruise for 2 weeks this summer. He’s got it all. That’s exactly what i’ve always been looking for: a serious relationship with a girl i like too.

Regarding me:

I definitely don’t look good. Also because i’m rapidly balding and because i look odd

( and no, shaving it off and going to the gym is not THE solution, it needs to be accepted and it’s not easy now ). 

The only partially good thing i got is that i’m fit and tall.

I’ve tried to open up more... get to know new people... but every time, i ended up being alone anyway. Everyone is in a relationship, or has some friends... i don’t think i can go on anymore",hi everyone ill try make short turn nmbr today nobody remember birthday none classmates none teammates literally nobody cause nobody never ever single friend one turn toxic look every girl saw instantly want number least star last summer spend nmbr month sea together handle week cause every time ignore one find perfect girl theyre plan go cruise nmbr weeks summer hes get thats exactly ive always look serious relationship girl like regard definitely look good also im rapidly bald look odd shave go gym solution need accept easy partially good thing get im fit tall ive try open get know new people every time end alone anyway everyone relationship friends think go anymore

sirhc0223,lonely,1619863249.0,I'm(32M) in the mood to cry. Actually...I am.,"It's so strange.  I have people to talk with, to message, but I don't.  I have my own discord server with 90+ people, yet I have been gone for over a week.  I have been feeling dead, so I just sent a short message to them saying that I won't be there for at least a couple of days.  I find myself on reddit...seeking attention.  Yes, I'm not alone, but feel so lonely none the less.  I don't know what it is that I'm going through.  I guess it's because certain unfortunate things had happened with 3 people in the server that hurt a lot.  It's also not as active as I would like it to be and I've spent so much time on it.  I guess it all had drained me, although I had gotten pretty close with the people who are active.

I have gotten so good at wearing a mask and I don't even have to think about it.  I feel dead on the inside, yet I don't project it unless I get vulnerable with someone.  When I have been vulnerable with someone, they're usually gone.  I try my best to pretend that things are ok most of the time, but I want to be honest with myself.  I want to feel accepted.  I don't want to sound all chipper, when I truly want to cry.

I've finally admitted to myself about what I want and what I'm looking for.  I feel like I've been denying it and trying to run away from it.  Now that I've accepted it, I feel even more lonely, even if it's such a normal thing to want.  I want a girlfriend...to be there just for me...for us to do cute things together.  Like watch things together, read to each other, etc..  

But...I was called a bad person by someone I got close with late last year.  And all I can see myself now is a bad person.  Although everyone seems to say otherwise.  I try my best to be there for people, yet I can't seem to be there for myself.  I just want to feel loved.  But as I was having a nervous breakdown, she said I was a bad person and cut me out.  I wasn't ok before that point, and I have been worse ever since.  I was trying so hard to focus on the silver linings, because good things had occurred since then, but...It feels like more like I'm running away.  And.....Using people to cover up how I'm truly feeling.

I'm 32, yet I feel like I'm still in highschool.  Like I haven't grown up...Like I'm stuck in the past.   I don't physically look my age, my voice doesn't sound like my age, and my behaviour doesn't reflect my age either. This isn't to say that I'm immature or anything like that. It's very hard to describe. I have so many internal contradictions.  Although this isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just...feel like everything else is passing me by and I'm left behind.

I'm not looking for compliments.  I don't really take them well...I don't believe them when people say them to me.  I just want to be held and have that person say something nice to me and not ever leave.  I just want to be loved and not feel insecure.  I want someone to understand me...accept me for all of my faults.  And not leave when I'm hurting..

If anyone is thinking that I should be seeing a therapist...I am.  After what happened late last year, I made an effort to start seeing one again.  Just...Please don't say anything like that if I'm contacted.  It's triggering.  Also, I don't want to be contacted by someone acting like they have it all figured out...Again...triggering.  I don't want to feel like a lesser than.  And um...If I'm contacted, please don't suddenly talk to me well, and then gaslight and/or suddenly tell me why you won't talk with me anymore..  It has happened...It hurts and...Yeah...triggering..  

When I talk with someone new, I usually try to make them feel safe, welcomed and comfortable.  It's so strange hearing that come from me considering I have social anxiety issues, but...People think I'm outgoing when I'm not.  I did make a conscious effort to get better at using my voice, so yeah.  Anyways, I guess the way I act with people, puts me in a very vulnerable spot.  I take everyone seriously and not treat them like a joke...When...I shouldn't be expecting the same from them.  

Sorry, this ended up being longer than I expected.  I was crying throughout it.  Just sniffling now.  Thanks so much for reading this.  I was debating with myself for a few days whether I should post something here, but here I am now...doing so.  Thank you again.

P.S. If anyone wants to talk with me, I prefer to voice.",strange people talk message discord server 90 people yet go week feel dead send short message say win least couple days find reddit seek attention yes alone feel lonely none less know go guess certain unfortunate things happen nmbr people server hurt lot also active would like spend much time guess drain although get pretty close people active get good wear mask even think feel dead inside yet project unless get vulnerable someone vulnerable someone usually go try best pretend things ok time want honest want feel accept want sound chipper truly want cry finally admit want look feel like deny try run away accept feel even lonely even normal thing want want girlfriend us cute things together like watch things together read etc call bad person someone get close late last year see bad person although everyone seem say otherwise try best people yet seem want feel love nervous breakdown say bad person cut ok point worse ever since try hard focus silver line good things occur since feel like like run away use people cover truly feel 32 yet feel like still highschool like grow like stick past physically look age voice sound like age behaviour reflect age either say immature anything like hard describe many internal contradictions although necessarily bad thing feel like everything else pass leave behind look compliment really take well believe people say want hold person say something nice ever leave want love feel insecure want someone understand accept fault leave hurt anyone think see therapist happen late last year make effort start see one please say anything like contact trigger also want contact someone act like figure trigger want feel like lesser um contact please suddenly talk well gaslight suddenly tell win talk anymore happen hurt yeah trigger talk someone new usually try make feel safe welcome comfortable strange hear come consider social anxiety issue people think outgo make conscious effort get better use voice yeah anyways guess way act people put vulnerable spot take everyone seriously treat like joke expect sorry end longer expect cry throughout sniffle thank much read debate days whether post something thank p anyone want talk prefer voice

mrsaturn513,lonely,1619929517.0,"I lost my two closest friends, because they started dating each other, and I had feelings for them.","Title pretty much says all, as complicated as it sounds... or maybe it isn't. I'm not sure at this point. To be honest I felt like I should make an anonymous account for this but I guess I don't really care anymore.

So Person A (29), Person B (27), and I (25) met in an mmo 3 years ago. I've never really had any real friends before, but we ended up getting really close pretty fast. I never thought that I'd ever find anyone even remotely similar or like minded to me, never mind even feeling comfortable being myself around. We hung out with each other everyday on discord voice and played games together. I even got to finally play dnd for once instead of just hearing or reading about it... I was happy. Of course it wasn't perfect, I know nothing truly is. There were plenty of times where I would end up feeling left out with the two of them even when we did things together. My self esteem was always really low...

Still, I ended up falling in love with the both of them. Not at the same time mind, Person A was pretty much shortly after we first met. It was the first time it felt like anyone outside of my parents ever truly cared about me. So a few months later, I confessed. I was fully expecting him not to feel the same way though, and he didn't, So, It didn't hurt as much. Soon After I ""moved on"", and by that I guess my feelings ended up moving over to Person B instead. More months pass, maybe even a year, and I end up confessing to them as well. They didn't feel the same way either. I should have gotten over these feelings after but I didn't this time.

Maybe it was because I was desperate to be in a romantic relationship, since I never have been, or maybe it was something in the back of my mind telling me that I'll never find anyone else in life, especially now with covid, but I ended up stupidly holding onto these feelings hoping that maybe someday they'll change their mind. There was just something about B that I kept pining over. Almost as if they were this long lost childhood friend that I've never had. We played a lot of the same games growing up, we had similar interests and ideals, even similar experiences in life... Almost like we shared the same brain cell as some people would say. They were like me, but more outspoken... but also more abrasive... which I should have been wary of all these years.

Despite that and pushing my feelings on the backburner, The three of us still grew closer. Or so I thought. These last several months, it felt as though I was drifting away from them despite how often we hung out everyday. And to them there were a lot of topics which I expressed being okay talked about in front of and enjoyed even, but they would still only talk about it without me. There was a lot of miscommunication. It ended up leading into a huge fight between me and B in December because they were going through something, and only told A and decided to shut me out of it. Which while I do understand it's their decision on who they tell, It felt as though I wasn't needed, and it hurt... The whole time during the fight, which pretty much lasted the whole month, It felt as though Person A only wanted to be there for B.

Regardless, we still made up in the end. But it also led to me confessing my feelings again for B because of what was said in the process of reconciling. I realized that part of the hurt was because of me still being in love with them. They still didn't feel the same way. Even then I thought it'd be okay, because we were still friends and that it'd be okay that A and B were growing closer together believing that it was all purely platonic. Even if they did end up being romantically involved together I tried to convince myself that it'd be okay anyway. That Illusion all shattered in March.

I was on my way home from work when Person A had messaged me on discord telling me that he wanted to talk to me about something. He told me that he and B had been dating for the last couple of months long distance, and I lost it. I was already depressed about a lot of things at the time, and they knew that, and I didn't have the emotional capacity to handle the news. I was so heartbroken and hurt and I started bawling on the spot in my car. It hurt even more because for the last few months, I could already tell something was going on between them based on how they acted towards each other. and I felt betrayed somehow because I had also confided in A about me falling in love with B.

I couldn't be around them anymore with how they handled things. My emotions were all over the place and I couldn't think straight. The next thing I knew, I told the both of them that I hated them, I lashed out, and hurtful things were exchanged between the three of us and I left. We shut each other out. I know I could've handled the whole situation better, and I should have but I didn't. I know I didn't handle the situation well, but to be honest I don't think they handled it well either. Again, lack of communication... I wish they could have told me beforehand that they had feelings for each other so I could finally push mine aside and make way for them. I know they were trying to figure out a way to make it hurt less or so they said, but they knew that this was gonna hurt me regardless, and the outcome just hurt so much more. Especially now that they think less of me. The last thing B said to me was to get over myself about this. It cut deep.

This all feels like something I should have experienced when I was younger. And now I'm sitting here all alone while the two of them get to have the relationship I longed for... It's only been a month since everything happened and I feel empty and depressed. Like there's this gaping hole in my chest. On the worst days, I feel like I'm drowning or suffocating and trapped... Every time I think I'm over it something reminds me of our time together and I just get kicked back down again. Sometimes I even dream that I'm still hanging out with them like nothing happened. I even ran into them again in the mmo we met in because there was a new update... It fucking sucked especially since, at least from the surface, they really have moved on without me.

I don't know, maybe I just deserve all of this in the first place for not being able to be a better friend to the both of them. I highly doubt they'll see this, but if they do, I'm sorry I couldn't... At the very least, I'm glad that I was able to experience what it felt like to have friends for once. even if it didn't last. I don't think I'll ever meet anyone that I can be close to ever again, but maybe it's for the best that I don't get attached anymore.

LettuceLucky,lonely,1620233745.0,I'm scared of losing my friends and don't know what to do," Hey guys!

I've been struggling with the thought of losing my (only) group of friends. It's going to be a little long so there's going to de a TL;DR at the end.

During high school I spent pretty much every single moment with this group (btw, we are five 19F right now) but now I'm starting to feel like I've grown out of them. Or that they have grown out of me. I don't know.

Last year, in March, we started uni. We were still close, not seeing each other very often because of a very long lockdown our country had, but we spoke regulary on the group chat, we watched movies together, played games, etc.

Everything was going pretty well until around July. Like I said, my country had a very long lockdown. My mental health started to suffer, and, as a consequence, my academic performance. (I forgot to mention, but I have a very important scholarship for the best engineering school in my country. The rest of my friends go to the public and free uni and study non-STEM degrees. I have to do really well in school in order to keep my scholarship). I was thinking of dropping out of school. I thought I wasn't as smart as everybody thinks I am. I was also suffering from Imposter Symdrome, I didn't think that I deserved that scholarship.

This went on for a couple of months. At this point, lockdown wasn't as strict as it was before so I met up with my friends a couple of times but I never mentioned this. Like I said, I didn't want people to know I was struggling. Only my parents knew. I've always struggled to communicate when I'm feeling bad.

Around october, I decided to change. I started taking my studies more seriously and I actually ended up doing a lot better in school. This year, so far, I'm doing way better and no longer paying attention to feeling inadequate. I'm very happy with how I'm doing in uni this year.

This improvement was made possible by studying a lot. Like 10-14 hours everyday. This led me to be pretty isolated, I spent the whole summer studying hard for my finals (which were around february) and I did really well. Because of this, I obviously didn't have time to meet up with my friends or play games with them. They didn't have finals around that time, so they were free to do whatever they wanted.

Flashfoward to a couple of weeks ago. I had exams, so I've studying like crazy. Nailed them. But as soon as I finished them I realized something: the group chat hasn't been used in weeks. I was very happy with my grades, especially knowing how bad I was a year ago, thinking about dropping out. But then I realized that I had no one (but my parents) to share this. I was completly alone. The thought of having no one to share what was making me happy made me very sad.

When I realized that, I sent a message to the group chat telling them that we haven't done anything together in a while and I'd be fun to do something (not IRL, my country is -again- in lockdown). They said yes and we decided to watch a movie that night. However, when the night came, no one was connected. I'd understand if they couldn't make it., but they had literally said that they could a couple of hours ago. I don't really understand with that happened.

Since then, I haven't really talked to them. Sometimes I answer their Instagram Stories, but I don't really have a lot of connection with them.

I forgot to mention, but everytime we talk they know everything about each other. They know what's going on with each others life. I'm clearly not part of those conversations. But they are private, so it's their decision to choose with whom they want to share their lifes. It's totally undestandable and I'm sorry I can't have the social skill required to look (and be) more helpful. I'd love to be the kind of friend that you go to when something good or bad happens in your life.

I know that our lives are changing. But I just don't know what to do. I don't blame them for anything. If it's someone's fault, it's mine. One of them got a boyfriend, another got a job. I get that they are busy and it's perfect. I'm really happy that they are having a good life. I don't really think I deserve them, they are too good for me (I mean, last year I was struggling but that is not a excuse to stop talking to them. I know my past actions were wrong and I'm deeply sorry if I caused them pain. Wish I could turn back time, but I can't). I just really miss them.

Since I realized how wrong I was, I've been feeling pretty dull the time. I'm still focusing on school. I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have friends on school (it's hard for me to make friends in online uni, if anyone's got advice PLEASE tell me). It's just that they were a very important part of my life, so everything reminds me of them. My favorite youtuber? One of them introduced me to her channel. My favorite tv show? One of them and I would talk for hours about that show. There's a lot of examples like these ones.

I keep thinking about this quote from the movie ""Her"": I'll always love you 'cause we grew up together and you helped make me who I am. I just wanted you to know there will be a piece of you in me always, and I'm grateful for that.

I'm very happy that they are having great lifes now. I just wish I was involved. I love them and miss them. And thinking that everything was my own fault makes me hate myself. I lost relatives, I lost friends, but I've never felt this bad before. I'm sad all the time.

I don't know what to do. I mean I tried to plan something and they didn't show up. I don't know if I should try to heal and forget about them or if I should keep trying to talk to them.

Anyway, if you read all of this thank you so much.

TD;DR: Struggled with mental health and school last year. Made a decision of doing really well in school. Studied a lot and I'm pretty good academically now. But in the progress I've noticed how my group of friends is starting to fade.",hey guy struggle think lose group friends go little long go de tl dr end high school spend pretty much every single moment group btw five 19f right start feel like grow grow know last year march start uni still close see often long lockdown country speak regulary group chat watch movies together play game etc everything go pretty well around july like say country long lockdown mental health start suffer consequence academic performance forget mention important scholarship best engineer school country rest friends go public free uni study non stem degrees really well school order keep scholarship think drop school think smart everybody think also suffer imposter symdrome think deserve scholarship go couple months point lockdown strict meet friends couple time never mention like say want people know struggle parent know always struggle communicate feel bad around october decide change start take study seriously actually end lot better school year far way better longer pay attention feel inadequate happy uni year improvement make possible study lot like 10 14 hours everyday lead pretty isolate spend whole summer study hard finals around february really well obviously time meet friends play game finals around time free whatever want flashfoward couple weeks ago exams study like crazy nail soon finish realize something group chat use weeks happy grade especially know bad year ago think drop realize one parent share completly alone think one share make happy make sad realize send message group chat tell anything together fun something irl country lockdown say yes decide watch movie night however night come one connect understand make literally say could couple hours ago really understand happen since really talk sometimes answer instagram stories really lot connection forget mention everytime talk know everything know go others life clearly part conversations private decision choose want share lifes totally undestandable sorry social skill require look helpful love kind friend go something good bad happen life know live change know blame anything someone fault mine one get boyfriend another get job get busy perfect really happy good life really think deserve good mean last year struggle excuse stop talk know past action wrong deeply sorry cause pain wish could turn back time really miss since realize wrong feel pretty dull time still focus school boyfriend friends school hard make friends online uni anyone get advice please tell important part life everything remind favorite youtuber one introduce channel favorite tv show one would talk hours show lot examples like ones keep think quote movie always love cause grow together help make want know piece always grateful happy great lifes wish involve love miss think everything fault make hate lose relatives lose friends never felt bad sad time know mean try plan something show know try heal forget keep try talk anyway read thank much td dr struggle mental health school last year make decision really well school study lot pretty good academically progress notice group friends start fade

Xeno-Bound,lonely,1620473068.0,My fear of abandonment,"I’m always afraid of people abandoning me, even if the fear isn’t entirely rational. My mind is always telling me things like “they don’t really like you” or “they prefer to be with others and not you” and it makes me scared. 

I’ve had this fear for a while now, but I think it became fully realized a few months ago, when I was actually abandoned. I had a romantic partner, and we both fell each other very hard. He made me feel loved, and worthy of being loved. My self esteem grew, I felt happier. However, one day, he stated that he no longer had feelings for me, and it was almost out of the blue. It was devastating. After all of the time we spent together, he just threw it all away. Now, we barely talk because of his busy schedule, and he spends time with other friends. It makes me feel discarded. 

These feelings of fear and loneliness have become so bad, it’s starting to have a negative impact on my friendships. I don’t want to be controlling or anything, but the thoughts and fears won’t go away. I feel like I’m being tortured while also being an asshole, and I don’t want to be either. I want this nightmare to end.

I was happy in my own little world playing games and watching anime but now the things I used to love don't bring me anything anymore. I have no one to share my accomplishments. I have no one to watch things with or talk about how work was or anything.

They turn down all my invitations to hang out, they don't message me anymore or even reply to me. I see them online every night playing the games I got her into and taught her how to play together and I can't even get a response from someone who I called my bestfriend and I'm heartbroken.

I miss having my dog(Delilah) sleeping by my feet at night. I’m getting her ashes today and it brought forth a mess of emotions. I thought about how alone I am without either of them. I’ve been depressed for years and it pushed my girlfriend away. She also has depression and I just stopped trying to help her and we just lived depressed together. I thought of breaking up with her constantly considering she might of been the issue. But when she broke up with me all I wanted was her back. Then she slept with someone in our apartment while we were still living together. That sent me over the deep end but for some reason I wasn’t mad at her. I still wanted her in my life but I was extremely upset. Then I moved out immediately. Keeping my name on the lease so she doesn’t get kicked out. Then a few months later my worst fear came true and I had to say goodbye to Delilah. It was the saddest moment of my life and I just wish she could of lived healthfully with me forever. I feel like a mess and don’t know why everything is hitting me at once.

Avolitionary,lonely,1620503793.0,"That linear clock throwing opposite, maybe this being the physics of my imagination.","I feel so disconnected and unable to relate beyond a certain point. 

It's frustrating. I keep being told it's where I was raised, my formative years being in Europe and despite on military bases, the exposure had a huge influence and living in the USA for nearly 20 years....I still feel alien.

37, crushing on a 21 year old that I've been trying to distance myself from (give me flack if you want, he's an amazing person who has no interest in me besides getting attention when he wants), few friendships that end up fading away, acquaintanceships that never get anywhete coz they are one sided, depression that had been really tough to trek through lately...mixed with anhedonia that I've been able to slowly pull myself out of...but  my personality has been stripped due to this.

Due to me still being a minor and that I live in the Uk, I still go to a fucking mess of a school. My entire class seems to isolate me and I occasionally hear them talking about me, though I don’t know what they are saying about me. Whenever we put out of our seating positions, my class sits on every table that isn’t the one I sit at. Apparently some of my classmates are actually somewhat scared of me, though I’m unsure of why. Hell, someone made a school-shooting joke and someone else said that if anyone were to commit a school-shooting, it would be me. The only thing my class knows me for is my hate for a certain boy in our class who has been bullying me for three years straight. I have never really had a full conversation with anyone in my class and I am physically harassed almost every day by the boy who I previously mentioned. He has punched me, kicked me, pushed me and decided to hit me in the head with a pencil case today. Whenever I decide to get back at him, he acts like the victim and gets away with all of the shit he’s done to me. He has sprayed hand sanitiser in my eyes twice and has hit me in the knees with a baseball bat in just this week alone. My class either mock me or act like I don’t exist. Whenever I try to say something, someone tells me to shut up. They then ask why I never talk. I feel like an object in my class. I don’t show emotion nor speak in my class unless it’s absolutely necessary.

I WANT to see my friends more irl, but going outside is already a heavy burden for me, my motivation is just too low. But I have also grown weary of being at home all day and seeing my family whenever I come out of my room. And today my PC (which is my best friend at home) kinda broke down. Something that makes me terribly anxious, for many documents are stored in that computer, just as my games.
 When such nasty things occur, my daydreaming skill comes to life and suddenly that feeling that I don't matter and that nobody loves me hits me in the face. Beside my family, no one showed love to me in years. This is also what I am feeling rn and the feeling just wont disappear, even though I am looking for  distraction in fun YouTube video's.
When I feel like this, I just want to cry, as a last try to get rid of it, but I can't cry. Like i just CAN'T. It is like I am not in the right mood to cry I guess. I think I am emotionless anyway, I can't remember the last time I knew what emotion I felt.

khvacant,lonely,1620007650.0,Waves of Loneliness,"(19M) I kinda wanna explain my circumstances and give background first:  

I’ll start with the past which will be part of high school and then bring it around to the present:  In 12th grade I got into my first relationship, but that all fell apart around this time last year.  All my flaws were basically pointed out to me and I was left an anxious, insecure mess.   I ran track back in high school and I actually knew a good amount of people, but I felt super alone and messed up after the break up, and really didn’t talk to anybody.  I didn’t have any goals or a sense of purpose, shit just wasn’t going good.  Other than being at the gym or the job I was at, I was in my room embodying the phrase “down bad” 😂.  COVID was in its prime so that only made things worse. 

(For more context my father passed away in the midst of things me really becoming a man and starting to have those struggles.  I have uncles to go to and what not but that comfortable figure to go to for guidance isn’t there anymore, which is probably a major reason why I’m on here)


From there on, I’ve been in situations where anxiety kicked my ass.  I realized a few things, a major one being that I really just gotta be myself and not put on some type of facade.  Point is, I began to understand a lot of the basic sentiments that are preached to people all the time.  

 Before this past year of college I knew I wanted stuff to change.  I began reflecting on myself and started doing things like no fap, meditation, cold showers, this that and the third.  In all this, I even discovered my passion for creating, and got into videography, photography, and things of that nature.  The only thing was that for the most part this school year, I was pretty much alone like I was in the summer.  I’m in a MUCH better headspace than I was then, and I’ve grown to be fine with being alone (that definitely can depend though).  It’s also not like I can’t have a conversation with anyone, and I’m definitely confident in my looks (idk how relevant that may be, but it’s just a perspective showing where my head is at). 

Here’s my point: Sometimes I’m just like “damn, I’m really alone in this shit”.  I start to think back to how I had that one person everyday just to talk to whom I genuinely was interested in.  I begin to think about how i’m at college and how it seems as if everyone is enjoying a great social life but me.  Even regular “guy talk” makes me semi-uncomfortable now because I haven’t really had experiences ever, let alone in college.  Just makes me feel more out of place 

Though I have been improving  myself I’ve just felt disconnected, and as if I need something more.  I’ve been really working on my passion and doing things with that, and I’m going to be working this summer too.  I’m just wondering if you guys have any advice on how I should proceed, and maybe tips on what to do if I start to feel down like I am right now.

SomeForgettableGuy,lonely,1620329417.0,I want to love someone,"I want to love someone, I have never been in love before. I feel very empty in my life, I don't do anything and don't want to do anything but I feel like if I had someone else there with me then things wouldn't be so bad. 

I'm fine most of the time but every few days I am reminded of how alone I am and it makes me really sad. 

I've never loved anyone before, and don't have family that loves me so I don't get any love and haven't felt loved in so long. 

All the women I've ever tried to get to know and date all chose another man over me, some even lead me on only to drop me so they can go off and fuck another man that is apparently better than me, which makes me sad.

I want to have someone in my life that makes me smile, someone that I want to do good things for, but instead all I get is a world seemingly full of judgemental assholes.

Everything would be so much easier if I could just meet someone...but the odds of that happening are almost zero...any women I meet won't like me. I can give them what they'd want from a partner, I'm not fun, I have no ambitions or motivation, and I think the world is shit. 

I know there are women that attach themselves to men like me, but they won't ever try to get to know me, because unlike the guys they choose over me, I won't verbally and physically abuse them. This isn't hyperbole, I've actually been considered lesser to an abuser...guess I just can't evoke any of the proper emotions in women, and will just be alone forever because I'm not attractive or interesting.

Is it normal? I mean, I am usually the guy who scores straight A's at most of the subjects, therefore a lot of people tries to take advantage of me (asking my class notes) but I usually sort these peope out quickly, and after that, I usually have like 10 acquaintances. 

Lmao, I am still a virgin, haven't have a girlfriend before, and to be honest, I dont really want a girlfriend. It would be a nuisance for me, plus I would feel myself limited and I would be forced to reorganize my time managment, which is a sensitive field (I like to work hard, but I also have a lot of ""me-time"", which I like to spend alone, doing my hobbies, like playing with video games or watching some sci-fi series)

Is it weird? Sometimes (really rarely) I have a sort if ""outcast"" feeling, if I could not fit in into society.

ExtremussPrime,lonely,1620248328.0,Got replaced and I'm depressed,"My best friend replaced me with her new classmates (and one in particular), so we barely played together. She spent a lot of time and continues to, with that classmate.
We were kinda best friends, duo at League of Legends, spent the whole day together playing or doing other things. And now she does those things with him, and me, 'have to be alright with that'.
We fought this past Saturday, because we were finally going to play a bit, told her to get in a call with me but she told she was already in a call with that people. In that moment I felt really bad, so told her I wasn't going to play and got out of the game. Then she texted me that I always say 'we don't play together anymore' and made fun of it. Told her to go back to her new friends and then she got mad, and wanted to end the friendship and stuff.
The moment she started that class, she changed for worst, ""I'm busy all day"", stopped texting me first, barely replied back with a few words.
I feel like shit. Told her I didn't wanted things to end, I entered a state of toxicity where I kept texting her and she ignores me. Last night told me if I keep texting a lot and with that kind of content, she'll block me.
So, here I am, trying to control me, lonely and depressed. I barely got any sleep since this past Saturday (5 days).
If anyone replies to this, probably will say that I have to move on, she's not worth it or things like that. You'll be right, but I don't want things to end, and not like this.

I'm those that have to text first or only text you when they need something. Lost friends because of different reasons, so kept getting alone over time, and I was ok with that, but not with her.

eyesour,lonely,1620531713.0,Once my sister moves I will have nobody,"I (23F) have lived with my sister for 2 years now. She is moving 8 hours away for grad school next week and once she moves away I will have nobody to talk to or be around in person. She is also taking the cat we have raised together. My parents live about 3 hours away, but they are moving across the country in a few weeks too and I will never see my childhood home again. I feel so lost already, and like I don’t have a real true home anymore once they’re gone if that makes sense. 
Today was my sisters undergrad graduation as well and she got to sit next to her friends, which also made me think about how when I graduate next year I will have no one there and will be all alone. 
I just feel very heartbroken and left behind, and I have tried to express that to everyone but I do not think they understand the true depth of my feelings. I also recently got taken off my insurance plan so I can’t even speak to a therapist.

Everytime i tell myself "" Maybe it's not your place, maybe next time you'll meet people that will appreciate you more, etc "" and i always end lonely in a corner with my phone and my headphones until i realised that there's something wrong with me and what's making me depressed that i don't know what it is.

Juice-Leia,lonely,1620516066.0,My attempt at “getting out there” today,"Today was Saturday so I was off work. As usual I had nothing to do and felt awful most of the day.

I found a small local pickleball event and decided to go. It was on the other side of town and there was lots of traffic. I felt kind of nervous but forced myself to keep driving there.

When I got there I approached the wrong group of people: Me: “Hi, are you from the app?” Her: “No...”

It was the other group of people on the courts. Well it turns out everyone there was 30s and 40s at the youngest and like 60 at the oldest.

I hadn’t played pickleball in about 8 years so I wasn’t very good. We played doubles and I sucked. I also didn’t understand the scoring at all or how taking turns serving works. It was awkward af.

After a handful of games some other players were saying they were going to head out. I wanted to leave too but wasn’t sure how. I just kept standing around trying to figure out how to get the hell out of there. Finally I waved and said “nice meeting you” and left.

So that was my experience today trying to “go outside” as is recommended for lonely people. On the positive side I got some exercise and did feel better than before. On the negative it was so awkward and none of these people are my age.

Overall I tried but still feel like I’m back at stupid square one. I don’t get how normal people have so many friends and exciting things going on whenever I try to go out and meet people it’s so mediocre.",today saturday work usual nothing felt awful day find small local pickleball event decide go side town lot traffic felt kind nervous force keep drive get approach wrong group people hi app group people court well turn everyone 30s 40s youngest like nmbr oldest play pickleball nmbr years good play double suck also understand score take turn serve work awkward af handful game players say go head want leave sure keep stand around try figure get hell finally wave say nice meet leave experience today try go outside recommend lonely people positive side get exercise feel better negative awkward none people age overall try still feel like im back stupid square one get normal people many friends excite things go whenever try go meet people mediocre

kawaiigirlUwU68,lonely,1620524364.0,Never feeling lonely.,"21F here. So i have aspergers and add (not sure if related). I had one super duper close friend and i still do and she is my cousin.
My parents were always concerned how i never showed interest in communicating with other people but didn’t do anything about it. 

I dont know whats wrong with me but everyone says that im weird for not having friends or talking to people, especially my cousin. My parents and cousin say its gonna be really hard for me in the adult world with no friends, but i dont want to have friends just to use them for help. 

I have never had any friends i kept for longer than a few months, they would always tell me i was weird and drop me. 

I knew i was ugly and had bad posture and i was bullied for that but i fixed both issues,but the only people who communicated with me were the ones who were looking for a relationship which i ended up going along with because i liked them but after breakups i would get dropped by them.

Now so far this might be sounding pretty incel to you, but my problem isn’t that i’m single it’s because for some reason I don’t get lonely or want friends and i don’t know how to fit in when i’m all alone all the time. My family and their friends always comment on me not being social with them or anyone else. And i hate it, because everyone sees me not being social or having friends as problematic or concerning.

I am concerned on how i am going to live in the adult world with no friends while i don’t wanna be forced to make some. Will i one day regret having them if i do?

I’ve began to realize that my mother has a problem with letting me grow up. I can’t be myself around her. I still have to act like an innocent little girl when I want to be a confident fun woman. I want to love myself. It all just hurt. I’ve been feeling lonely for so long and it only seems to be getting worse no matter how hard I try. I feel like I’ll always just be that loser with no friends. I feel like I won’t be about to make long lasting relationships with people, if I’m even able to talk to them in the first place.

,lonely,1620053531.0,Lonely without an idea how to change it.,"Hey other lonely people, I've got to this very desperate point in my life where i feel more lonely than ever and by a long shot. I know what the other side is like, been deep in the sauce not having enough time for everyone, yet I'm just as far down to scale just the opposite end.

To give some context i used to work and that's all I did, 5 days a week, 8h+ a day always talking to people and interacting, coworkers as well as customers.
I was completely spent by the time my days came up and i spent it sitting in my room smoking weed and playing video games. The classics, not joining my friends for nights out because I was too tired, never making plans.

Eventually I couldn't keep it up and quit my job a couple months after covid started in effort to try enjoy my life a little but this step was the first to my issue spiraling out of control. Due to lockdown and restrictions i couldn't see my friends anyways if i wanted to make plans. I wasn't seeing my coworkers or keeping myself busy with work. I was cruising and relaxing after 3+ years of non-stop work.

To top it off i moved back with my parents as well, no free house to invite who i want. I was in contact with a friend who moved away, also was in a similar situation at the time but eventually they were able to go back to work as restrictions are eased in his country.
We used to talk every day and play video games, we had each other at least. Since he left i just have a void in me, he was the only person still close to me.

My parents and i are ok but they don't really interact with me if that makes sense, i stay in my room lonely and sad and they don't really come to me. I feel like they just gave up on me / don't really care, even though I think they do I'm just not sure why they don't put effort into showing it.

NoAdministration2951,lonely,1619983074.0,Am I lonely or depressed or ugly ?," 

Hey people.

I work in a Bank in India. I don't have anyone to hang out with on weekends - am getting very lonely. I tried getting close with people in office but it isn't working. Like I can talk and maintain a good rapport there, but a plan to meet outside of work simply doesn't happen.

Its been 1 year me working there now. Outside office, my pg friends left for hometown last year itself. Then I took a flat and now am completely alone. Neighbours are all live-in couples, just to add to the loneliness feeling.

Due to covid there is no scope for any other way of meeting people. Also I accept that chances are less regardless. I tried dating apps but am skinny guy so chances are very low, I never get a match.

Due to covid the roads are mostly empty. But the area I live in I can see couples all around - it just reminds me how ugly I am.

I cry on weekends in my flat alone. Financially I am a mess. Savings are nil - if I'm fired tomorrow my whole life will be a mess.

I dont know what my problem is - Loneliness / Depression or am I just so ugly.

I feel i'm inching closer to suicide every day.

Please advise.",hey people work bank india anyone hang weekend get lonely try get close people office work like talk maintain good rapport plan meet outside work simply happen nmbr year work outside office pg friends leave hometown last year take flat completely alone neighbour live couple add loneliness feel due covid scope way meet people also accept chance less regardless try date apps skinny guy chance low never get match due covid roads mostly empty area live see couple around remind ugly cry weekend flat alone financially mess save nil fire tomorrow whole life mess know problem loneliness depression ugly feel inch closer suicide every day please advise

VioletShadow138,lonely,1619996597.0,"Pushing 40, living alone and single for the first time ever...here is a short snapshot of my life","I don't know how to do this. Being alone...all the time... I didn't grow up right, I was in an AWFUL, abusive, cult-like church growing up and stayed with terrible people in one long-term relationship after another for many years because I just didn't know how to function when I left high school. I gave up on organized religion many years ago and partied my 20s and most of my 30s away...being a musician in many different bands and gigging around bars/clubs/parties/venues/etc. There absolutely IS such a thing as the wrong crowd. And all the while I was with someone who cheated on me, disrespected me, and used me up for nearly 15 years. I had no self worth. But COVID times tore it all up, he went off to live with the singer of my former band, and I was left in my home jobless, injured and ill for the winter. I lost many people I thought were friends and was unable to recoup friendships I thought I had before that relationship. For 6 months AFTER the breakup last year, I was quarantined with both of them in my own home, and when they finally moved out with each other, the INTENSE, screaming-at-the-wind kind of gut-wrenching loneliness kicked in. 

I have never felt this way before. I have immediate family, a handful of friends, and one married best friend I am in love with, which further complicates my life. I try to play video games and music to ease the pain, but then something will trigger me and next thing I know I am screaming into a pillow and sobbing on the floor for hours. I have never been loved the ""right"" way, whatever the hell that means.  

I still have no job over a year later despite my best efforts. I don't have a band to play in and socialize...I don't know how to connect to people properly unless music is involved. I have never felt this alone in my life, even though I have a small handful of people I am SO thankful for who are rooting for me.

dmank007,lonely,1620188594.0,"Each individual’s perception of reality is unique, and nobody will ever have the opportunity to see the beauty of the world through each others eyes.","I am going to write this in first person because it is simpler to write that way, but please interpret this as an observation regarding each individual person on the planet.

I was born, i was raised, and I have had thousands (if not millions) of unique experiences that shape the way i think and perceive reality around me. People are inherently selfish and think about themselves; not a single person (except for my father) in my entire life has truly given half a shit about me. This leads me to the realization that when I die, all of my experiences and wisdom that I gained throughout this existence will die with me.  No one will be able to live what i lived through, and those who come after me will never be able to learn from the mistakes i made, leading them to unnecessary pain and suffering.

No one will ever ask me “hey xxxx, what do you think about this philosophical issue?” Or “hey xxxx, what’s your viewpoint on yyyy.”  People always want to talk about themselves and never leave room for the other person to insert their knowledge or potential expertise into a situation unless it benefits them in some way.

Therefore, when i or another person dies, we have a  grossly inefficient transfer of knowledge simply due to our inherent selfishness, and this makes the world a darker place.  And the understanding of this concept (at least through my eyes) is lonely as fuck.

kferrero,lonely,1619920389.0,Can Anyone Relate To..,"Hi there,

I’m quite new to Reddit. I found this community and I guess I’m just looking for affirmation that I’m not the only one who feels the way I do regarding my social life. I’m 23, and as far as I can remember, I have struggled to make close connections. I also have never been in a relationship. I’m not sure if it’s because I can be socially awkward or anxious at times, or if it is also based on my circumstances. The majority of my grade school experience was a very small, private school. Besides the small selection of people in my grade, I was also shy and considered the perfectionist or the teacher’s pet. I went to three different high schools from 9th-12th and barely had the chance to settle. I’m finishing up college, and I go to my local university. I transferred out-of-state because I felt like I’d have better social and educational opportunity elsewhere, but due to medical issues had to return to my hometown. I’ve never had the financial means of living on-campus, so many times I’d take the hour drive from my family’s home to and from campus. I finally decided my junior year to use the money I had saved up to move out and live close to campus, but the pandemic hit and so my dreams of making new connections came somewhat to a halt. Since I moved out, I have lived in four different apartments due to short-term leases and financial reasons. I believe I am a friendly person, but I think the volatility of my living situations and locations has made socializing difficult. I do not have a car either, so I usually walk or take the bus around. I have joined various groups on campus when I could, but never got too far besides an acquittance to anyone within those clubs. I have also joined dating apps with minimal expectations in order to meet up with people, but many times I am ghosted or it seems like people do not want to meet up in real life. I’m curious if anyone can relate and could offer any advice. I'm very open to listening. What could I be doing wrong?",hi im quite new reddit find community guess im look affirmation im one feel way regard social life im 23 far remember struggle make close connections also never relationship im sure socially awkward anxious time also base circumstances majority grade school experience small private school besides small selection people grade also shy consider perfectionist teachers pet go three different high school 9th 12th barely chance settle im finish college go local university transfer state felt like id better social educational opportunity elsewhere due medical issue return hometown ive never financial mean live campus many time id take hour drive familys home campus finally decide junior year use money save move live close campus pandemic hit dream make new connections come somewhat halt since move live four different apartments due short term lease financial reason believe friendly person think volatility live situations locations make socialize difficult car either usually walk take bus around join various group campus could never get far besides acquittance anyone within club also join date apps minimal expectations order meet people many time ghost seem like people want meet real life im curious anyone relate could offer advice open listen could wrong

Then one day I come home to empty house and a letter about how she wants to be independent and prove she can live on her own, she wants all this spiritual quiet and escape from everyone and just a lot of selfish things. Okay we smoothed it over the next got things off our chest and agreed hey this is gonna be great and be better for us and over the past 3 months she gets farther and farther away.  She is a very aggressive hi strung person and still even living separately everything pisses her off and even me on my usual loving hey I miss you text would create friction because she wants everyone to leave her alone and she is so tired of the phone ringing. (Yes she has a busy phone because of work). Sooo here is is the night befoe a month since I have seen her and week since I text her.  I tried to get together but her girlfriends are more important and even lunch FaceTime dates got ruined because of something she is doing and the one person who has been there and loved her so much after being beat down (mental and word abuse) still right here. Idk what I did because damn did I try and out a lot of weight on my shoulders to see her smile and she never smiled, it was always something to complain or scream about.  I’m tired of sitting around waiting for my phone to go off and disappointed every time it’s everything but her,  this past week a buddy said hey man wanna go up to the farm,  shoot guns and fix the Cadillac and instant idk what to do anxiety rushed because yes I do but what if she calls and says hey me and the kiddos are... do you wanna come.   Guess what? I bailed and guess who didn’t call or anything.  Yeah. After listening to a lot of Gaia, YouTube videos I realized I can’t let someone have that much power over me. If I keep living in the past. (This date in memory photos) I can’t move forward as my brain is stuck in that pattern. My lease is up in July and god damn it I’m moving an hour away. (Closer to my job) found me a one bedroom apartment because well nobody can live with me and I’m gonna force my self to get comfortable being alone and not in a negative way but in a good way to love my self and not be so co dependent. 

But tonight I’m lonely,  I can’t stop wondering where and what did i do and go wrong and actually can come up with nothing when any other time I can list things where I went wrong cuz I blame it all on me so I don’t think I’m wrong and truly believe this is a situation of their loss and have been talking to my self like a buddy would talk or I would talk to a buddy.

Ever since I left school and everyone went off into the “real world” I’ve realised how unimportant I am to everyone who isn’t my family. I know I shouldn’t be selfish and by no means to I expect my friends to make me their number one priority, however seeing how much effort I put in vs how little effort they put in has made me realise I don’t hold the same place in their life as they hold in my life. I saw someone else say this a while back, but it’s like they’re main characters in my life and I’m just a side character to them. They’ve all made tons of new friends and have so many people around them whilst I only have them. I understand that people grow apart naturally and you’re not always gonna be as close but it’s so hard to watch them flourish whilst I am so alone. I tried so hard to make new friends but it never works, I thought I’d made a new friend recently but he recently told me that he can’t be bothered to talk to me anymore. Just like that those few months of building a new friendship were gone. I know it’s my own fault for letting him become so important in my life but wow it’s hurts to be told that. 

I just wish someone would see me as important, in the same way I see them as important.

Ottaro666,lonely,1619988475.0,My friend recommended me how to make friends in the current situation and I’m so happy about it,"*This is not an ad and I will not mention which app I’m talking about unless someone tells me that’s allowed.*

I kept feeling down because lately I’m pretty lonely and bored. I usually don’t mind having only one or two close friends, but since we’re still under lockdown it hit me more than usually. Plus all my classmates are younger than me and I can live with it, but I’d love to be friends with people my age. 

Anyways, I told my friend and she fortunately told me about an app where you can easily make friends. Since advertising isn’t allowed I won’t mention the name! It’s not hard to find apps like that though. I sent some people requests and even received one. Now I’m finally having someone who’s around my age that I can talk to, plus another friend. 

I can really recommend getting out there online at the moment. With corona and everything it’s not easy to make friends or date. But be careful when interacting with people online, and don’t give away private information like your real name or your address, etc.!",ad mention app im talk unless someone tell thats allow keep feel lately im pretty lonely bore usually mind one two close friends since still lockdown hit usually plus classmates younger live id love friends people age anyways tell friend fortunately tell app easily make friends since advertise allow mention name hard find apps like though send people request even receive one im finally someone whos around age talk plus another friend really recommend get online moment corona everything easy make friends date careful interact people online give away private information like real name address etc

Pennyroyal_Tea2,lonely,1619977870.0,Finally a day without feeling lonely and with some sweet sweet human contact,"Being an introverted guy with some social anxiety is already really hard in this society, and the pandemic made it ten times worse. Even tho I work in a supermarket (so I can interact with other people daily) and managed to hang out with a couple friends, at least on weekly basis whenever we could, loneliness during quarantine sometimes still feels really overwhelming.

The thing personally I miss the most is human contact. Cuddling, hugs or even just someone giving you a pat on the back or a handshake. In the long run the lack of human contact makes you feel so bad, to the point you start asking yourself if there's anything wrong with you.

Anyway, today in many eastern European countries it's Easter. Finally we had the chance to meet some relatives, eat and drink together and have a fun afternoon after a long long time. My uncles came to visit us for lunch and the afternoon, and since I have a little cousin she also came. She's only 4 years old and she's soo sweet and we vibe a lot together. Lonely and human contact starved me couldn't stop hugging her every ten minutes or so, probably hugging her way over 20 times this afternoon. We played together with some snapchat filters, took a few pics together, I showed her my guitar and played a couple songs, we both combed each others hair and just cuddled a little on sofa. I'm feeling happy and good right now. Dunno how long it will last, but I'm so glad I can say \*screw you loneliness\* for a day.

To all of you guys out there feeling down, opportunities like this are rare. But they exist. Sometimes life just gives you a sunny day when you thought clouds and rain would never go away. Keep the good work up and be glad whenever you have a nice day, cause they are priceless.

I know most of the posts here are sad and negative, but I hope reading this gave someone a little hope. Even if it's just one person who enjoyed reading this I'm more than glad!

The noise in the apartment is quiet without my boyfriend ( ex now ) making noise just makes nervous and sad. All I could wonder why both had to turn on me when I refuse to allow her best friend) boyfriend to move in.

At the time, I wanted my ex out of the house so maybe we can get along better and have the space we need. As well too stop lying to my parents about people inside my apartment, that they had their name written on the lease. Main reason, it would be me and her again yet the worst scenario had to happen over nothing. Just dumb gossip between my boyfriend(ex) and best friend who started the despise me. I know it had to be my boyfriend who stir the pot for his sake and she believed him.

No matter how angry I try to stay it would always get replaced by sadness and I wondering how will I deal with so much heartbreak and loneliness at once. 

And now I'm cuddle up with a plushie my father gave me for Valentine's Day years ago. It helps to feel some kind of connection towards someone and not try to feel lonely.

KubrickandMorty,lonely,1619919431.0,I hate being alone in college,"Almost all of my friends are seeing people or are in relationships. I spent some time with some classmates to work on an assignment today, and they all started talking about the various people they were seeing. I had to just pray they wouldn't ask me, because I would have nothing to say. I've been alone for almost three years, haven't even held someone's hand in that time, and every day I just get one day further from knowing how it feels to be wanted. It just seems like I'm wasting my time in college. My friends, even my brother, are in relationships or hook up with people, and I can't even find the opportunity to talk to someone. Tinder has become a daily reminder that nobody wants to be with me.

&#x200B;

I reached a new low today. My friend, who I have feelings for (and who has rejected me in the past), told me that she received a message from a guy on an anonymous website run by our school. The website basically operates by having people send anonymous messages to people they're interested in, and then the person has to guess the identity of the mystery person. Like an idiot, I signed up and sent my friend a message, because it was the closest I could feel to having someone be interested in me. She responded, and now I have to pretend to be someone else so she doesn't find me weird and stop being friends with me. So now I have to have someone who I'm interested in message me in pursuit of a potential fling or whatever, all the while knowing that she would have no interest in me in real life.

MissedSupper,lonely,1620604950.0,Don't Give Up. You Are Your Hope.,"To everyone in this community, it is deeply sorrowful that you feel isolated to the point that you don't even feel like you have yourself. That's what loneliness and numbness from depression can do to your heart. I'm sorry you don't feel loved, especially when there are billions of people on Earth but they fail to be at our aid when we need them more than we feel like we need Earth itself to breathe. 

We have to address our hurting by not stopping our options for a **future** with suicide. It may feel easier to stop living when the inside of your head is a mental hell and you may feel like you're a mentally ill person or even the loneliness may drive you to believe: ""I am unlovable"".

But even when the whole world doesn't seem to exist for us in that moment of deep despair or that long grieving for the childhood or moments of happiness that seem distant, we have to choose our own wellness first. That means letting go of the scary thoughts that no one is coming in to save you or be your friend. It hurts so much and it is soul-breaking but that's how you start to realize how important you are because then you do realize you are always there for you. 

This may not feel like the truth because we can also be our greatest of enemies. Our mental illness drives us crazy. However, they exist **to tell us something**. You are always there for you even if it feels counterintuitive. We can act negatively because **we want to express our pain**. We feel depressed because **we need to treat ourselves better**. We feel anxious because anxiety is a defense mechanism that tells us **""something is wrong""**. We can self-harm because we may be suffering from anhedonia (no pleasure due to severe depression) and so we need to release ourselves from the pain of emptiness. We feel suicidal because we want to stop our pain but we don't know how to manage our emotions or get away from the pain. 

**We need to learn** to manage our emotions in a healthy and effective manner. This means looking at our situations and to analyze ourselves logically as we lack the thoughtfulness behind objective thinking. Doing so well help establish a balanced way to thinking. A beautiful way of thinking that you can see life and appreciate every aspect of it. Starting with objective thinking will help ease the projecting self-doubting thoughts. It will start to develop your subjective (Feelings) so you may feel free from your internal hell. Finally, you shall have open mindedness at its truest form. 

Please DM me if you would like to talk. The above skill is important for humanity to learn so I am hoping to make a mental health website with my friends and I. Please use these skills, please share these skills and please hold onto yourself because you literally NEED you!!

Much love and hold on.

I think this is the reason for my loneliness," I can't have fun with anything or anyone, I mean I try but it's something lacking in my inside that doesn't let me feel joy for anything, I hate myself and I don't know how to improve lol, I've been trying to start talking with people but I don't feel interested enough in anybody, I do try to put effort but I can't control feelings so I end up talking about the same boring things over and over with everyone and not having anything to say since I'm not interested in any hobby at all, like how can I talk to people if I don't have fun talking with people? It's depressing and I make others depressed.
 I envy those guys who have a passion in a sport and can talk about it all day, or those people who can go to parties and talk to everyone and have fun, or those who can play videogames with their friends and laugh alot saying and doing the dumbest shit they could think of, or even the kids who go on bike trips with their friends to have a good time, like why I can't do any of that??? If I do those things I would be so sad and depressed that wouldn't be able to enjoy it, I wouldn't be able to say anything fun neither do anything fun, I'm that boring person which nobody wants to invite to the party because it would just make things worse :c",fun anything anyone mean try something lack inside let feel joy anything hate know improve lol try start talk people feel interest enough anybody try put effort control feel end talk bore things everyone anything say since interest hobby like talk people fun talk people depress make others depress envy guy passion sport talk day people go party talk everyone fun play videogames friends laugh alot say dumbest shit could think even kid go bike trip friends good time like things would sad depress able enjoy able say anything fun neither anything fun bore person nobody want invite party would make things worse c

TwilightNightlight,lonely,1619831580.0,Remaining cheerful through brutal reality,"Where I'm at now, I haven't a soul on earth. As a mid-30's male I've been around the block when it comes to building friend circles, social circles, hobbies, and dating.

There's a phenomenon with humanity where some people are naturally outcast without great commotion. Some of us are just silently excluded, like Milton from Office Space waiting on a piece of cake. The reality is that neither nature nor humanity cares about your social well-being, especially if you're a male.

If you're confident, successful in your career, funny, outgoing, extroverted, but still single and alone, people assume it's by choice.

I've seen this every day of my breathing life. No one that ever met me would be able to guess I feel this way because I am extroverted, and yes often the funny man in the room.

The common advice on Reddit dating subs follows the fight-or-flight pattern: get ripped and put on some cologne, and if you're already doing that and asking out women and failing, then flee and just forget about it. Your luck WILL change when you least expect it. It's guaranteed. That's the attitude.

Nature is unfortunately not so kind, it kills people and animals alike indiscriminately. Why would social isolation or any other form of suffering be any different?

How do I remain happy through all of these thoughts? How am I not suicidal?

Because I am more fortunate than those who have died young. And even if women will never find me attractive, and even if guys don't want to hang out with me, cheerfulness and positivity are all that I have left. Jokes and self-deprecating humor make me feel whole again. Kindness and charity connect me with the world that has rejected me for who I am.

It's better to go out in class as a grateful, cheerful, focused individual rather than one wallowing in his/her own pain. Accept life's morbid realities, realize that it's not fair, embrace the outcome which may or may not be eternal loneliness, and savor every drop of life's beauty.",soul earth mid 30 male around block come build friend circle social circle hobbies date phenomenon humanity people naturally outcast without great commotion us silently exclude like milton office space wait piece cake reality neither nature humanity care social well especially male confident successful career funny outgo extroverted still single alone people assume choice see every day breathe life one ever meet would able guess feel way extroverted yes often funny man room common advice reddit date sub follow fight flight pattern get rip put cologne already ask women fail flee forget luck change least expect guarantee attitude nature unfortunately kind kill people animals alike indiscriminately would social isolation form suffer different remain happy thoughts suicidal fortunate die young even women never find attractive even guy want hang cheerfulness positivity leave joke self deprecate humor make feel whole kindness charity connect world reject better go class grateful cheerful focus individual rather one wallow pain accept life morbid realities realize fair embrace outcome may may eternal loneliness savor every drop life beauty
gUmFisT,lonely,1620546260.0,I'm really lonely.,"I'm 15 almost 16, I haven't had any relationships and I'm crying again, just right now as I type this.
And what makes this worse is that everyone I knew in my life (my parents, my siblings, cousins, classmates, or whoever I have known so far in real life) have friends and older ones having to be on a couple on top of them that care for each other, active relationships unlike me.

My mother has my father, my father has my mother, my little sister has dear friends, all my older stepsisters are on a healthy couple relationship, all my cousins have dear friends, my classmates walk with someone very often unlike me, who has no one.
Looking at everyone having fun with others and their friends and all that stuff, makes me kind of glad and happy for them that they probably wouldn't have to go though this and that they have somebody to live for but the thought about thinking if I'll ever be like the people I see or if I'll ever have someone that would care about me as much I would care for them just completely overshadows that.
No matter what I do, I will always keep thinking about that everytime I see relationships and such, it just so begins to pain me feeling that nobody cares.
I also seem to have social anxiety, struggling to open up to others, nearly my whole teen life confined in quarantine and covid failing my online classes. I'll be an adult as this whole pandemic would be over and it just starts to scare me that my highschool years were wasted. I have already struggled opening up in-person without covid lacking friends, people and classmates knowing me for being shy and no way I would even be able to make a friend with this broken online system.

I’m 18 years old and for the longest time I’ve felt empty and lonely. Dating apps only reinforce that so I’ve deleted them but it hurts seeing how easy it is for some guys to pull girls. I’m not even sure what to think anymore, I don’t think I’m that bad looking or that bad of a person but it seems like I just have the worst luck. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong so I could fix it but I feel stuck. It sucks most girls go for the “bad boys” who treat them like shit, I just wish I could get a chance. I’ve been battling a porn addiction and suicidal thoughts because of how lonely and depressed I feel. I wish things were different, I wish there was a way out. I try my best in doing the right things: working out, meditating, reading, practicing self love, etc but I can’t escape this feeling of lack, this craving for human interaction. Maybe I’m just feeling sorry for myself and I should suck it up but I needed to get this off my chest. I hope whoever is reading this has a great day, and if you’re feeling as lonely as I am that the pain subsides and you find a meaningful purpose to stay alive and enjoy life.

estevao_mod,lonely,1619879278.0,I so fck miss my friends,"hi, guys. I am Estevão and i am 22 yo. Let me tell you guys my history. I spent most of my life in the church, but I left it when I went to college and changed many of my ideals and beliefs. After going through a period of great confusion with myself after leaving the church, I am already in a much better time and I can like myself the way I am. My friends walked away from me while I was in this transition phase of leaving the church, and to be honest, I also stayed away from them because I stopped going to the same places we used to go to, like church, evangelical parties, meetings with other young evangelical people, and so on. I am not angry with them, on the contrary, I still like them, but we are on different paths. Many of them are getting married and are going on with their lives, and I somehow miss having them with me and the moments we live in. Today I write this because it was my brother's birthday and one of my friends came here at home and we had some conversations. It is difficult for me to live with all this, I tend to understand, but in the end there is always that feeling that we could still be together and following similar paths. I feel bad for leaving them, but at the same time I feel good because I believe my place was not to stay in the church. I made some good friends in college, but they are kind of circumstantial friends, and when they finish college they will also leave. This year I will finish college and I believe that very soon I will move to another city and this cycle of my life will end in an end. Have you guys gone through something like that?",hi guy estevão nmbr yo let tell guy history spend life church leave go college change many ideals beliefs go period great confusion leave church already much better time like way friends walk away transition phase leave church honest also stay away stop go place use go like church evangelical party meet young evangelical people angry contrary still like different paths many get marry go live somehow miss moments live today write brother birthday one friends come home conversations difficult live tend understand end always feel could still together follow similar paths feel bad leave time feel good believe place stay church make good friends college kind circumstantial friends finish college also leave year finish college believe soon move another city cycle life end end guy go something like

boatsir,lonely,1620126075.0,"I’m lonely but I really feel like I shouldn’t be. I’m lonely even around my friends, all because of my codependency to one person.","M[18] I need some advice here, I’ve been spiralling quite a bit recently. So, I’m a very naturally happy person. I’m extroverted and I have loads of friends. I’ve always been ok not being the person any of them are the closest to, because I had my best friend. We used to date until she got overwhelmed by the concept of dating, and broke up with me. I love her SO much. I’d practically do anything for her, but I also consider her the worst thing that’s happened to me. Since meeting her 2 years ago, I’ve become completely codependent on her. She loves me, she knows me more than anyone. I have a hard time feeling myself and comfortable with others (as much as I love having friends) and me and this girl could spend weeks on end together. We did everything together, she would get more angry at others than I did when people were mean to me. She loved me just as much as I loved her, or more. A bit ago I stopped talking to ALL my other friends, I only needed her. I’ve kind of regained all my old friends not too long ago though.
But recently she told me she just, doesn’t feel connected anymore. She hasn’t been feeling disconnected from everything recently. It’s just me. It doesn’t seem to be bothering her or anything either, she seems pretty happy when we have our weird conversations like we’re two strangers that don’t have a connection. She always takes a while to answer. I can’t be honest to her about being sad, I know she’ll just get awkward and leave and I can’t deal with that.
I’ve recently got incredibly clingy to my other friends. I don’t want to be alone thinking about the possibilities of losing her for one second. But without her there, I can’t connect to anyone, but I still feel clingy with them. I know I both like them more than they like me but feel less connected to them than they do to me simultaneously. It’s really getting to me. All of them are there for me, but the thought that they’re helping me even though they don’t feel very close me, really hurts. 
I probably sound like some guy who can’t get over his ex, but I’m autistic, I’ve never gotten this type of connection in my life. She’s also autistic and understood my special interests and would comfort me when I got sensory overload.

Dangerous-Stick-831,lonely,1620099375.0,I feel like I never had the opportunity to fit into society,"Ever since I was little, I always remember being alone. While in preschool other children would be playing amongst themselves, I would be playing with woodchips imaging I was the protagonist from *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*. There would be a few times I'd play with other kids, but my interactions were limited. I remember one time in kindergarten there was this kid new to my school, so I befriended him. I held a birthday party that year, but he didn't show up. At school the following day presumably, he told me that he didn't come not because he was busy or anything, but because he didn't want to.

Throughout elementary, I would try to fit in with other students, but I was always following people versus leading them. There was this one boy in my class that was very charismatic and would control what the majority of people did during recess. Every year, I remember hoping I would get invited to his birthday party. Sometimes I would, sometimes I wouldn't. I would always feel sad and left out when I wasn't invited. Throughout elementary, I did partake in sports and scouts, but this didn't help me make friends at all.

Fourth grade or so was when I started to feel like I didn't fit into society, and society didn't want me in it either. Multiple times, children would tell me their parents said not to hang out with me. I don't feel this was warranted. I wasn't that bad of a child. I'd disrespect adults here and there, and I used curse words. None of this was too bad compared to the average child my age. I always tried to be civil and nice to people and corrected many of my issues before Christmas break that year. Nothing changed and this pattern of rejection and social outcast has persisted until today. I would only very rarely get invited to hang out with children my age outside of school, either through playdates or birthday parties. I would attend one out-of-school social event every three or so months.

In fifth grade, I reached my height of social popularity, but it didn't last long. I became somewhat of a class clown, but the teacher liked me, so I wasn't that horrible. More popular students in my grade thought I was funny, so I became friends with them. Still, this was around the time when everyone started getting cell phones. I never got a cell phone and didn't understand the appeal. I also, despite my in-school popularity, never was invited to anything outside of school. I was sort of that kid people would talk to in classes to pass time, but outside of this limited circumstance, there was no reason to talk to me. With this social isolation growing and me dropping out of extracurricular activities, I began turning towards the Internet for social interaction. Of course, I had been using the Internet for years, playing online games, but I had never tried making connections with people before. The Internet stopped being a way for me to simply play games I loved and instead became a drug of the social life I desired. 

Through Minecraft, I developed many friendships. Of course, none of these were long-lasting, and as soon as I stopped playing Minecraft, I lost all of these friends. Later I started playing Terraria again and made more new friends. This led to me getting Discord, which even further increased my amount of online friends. None of these friends stuck around; many seemed to disappear as fast as they appeared. My best friend one month would be my enemy the next, or they would forget about me or turn on me for seemingly no reason. 

Around this time, I started developing misanthropic feelings due to my loneliness. No matter what I did, I could never seem to get friends. I grew jealous of others for their successes and wondered what they were doing that I wasn't. I grew getting more sad and frustrated with myself. I found that just my username, like my name in real life, would lead people to automatically hate me. People would hear rumors about me and not even give me a chance. Numerous Discord servers I was banned from because of things people had heard about me, many of which were not true and spread by stalkers or people who betrayed me. 

I looked for a solution for this problem, and I thought I found it. I began making numerous alternate accounts under which I would act differently. I started first with accounts where I would say I was a foreigner. I didn't gain any online social advantages from this, but at least my name wasn't holding me down anymore. This series of alternate accounts led to me making accounts where I, a male, would claim to be female. I mainly just did it because I was curious what it would be like to be female, or at least act like I was female, much for the same reasons I acted like a foreigner before. I grew amazed with my social success. I was invited to multiple Discord servers and would be often invited to play games with people. This didn't last long for me, as it made me very sad. I knew the reason these people were friends with me was not because of my personality or anything, but because I was acting like a female. I wasn't myself. This instilled in me an envy of females, as I viewed them as already having an advantage socially due to being female (there are many less females in online spaces I hang out). The accumulation in this was gender dysphoria for about a year (sorry if that isn't the right term, but other transgender people I had associated with short-term had shared my feelings). 

I've been mostly talking about the online part of my life for the past couple of years, but that's because it was the only life I had. I only became more socially isolated. Throughout all of middle school, I think I was only invited to one or two parties. I didn't have any stable friends, and would even be deliberately outcast by people, probably by their parents' wishes. 

High school was nice as I was around a lot of new people. Throughout years of social isolation, I didn't even know how to make friends. People seemed to already have their friend groups set. The only attention I would get from others would be mockery. Males would mock me in front of females and their friends, giving me sarcastic compliments. Females would hold cameras to my face to post on their social media while laughing. I'm not an attractive person, and throughout all my life have been called ugly by classmates and family alike, so I think it is safe to assume people in high school viewed me more as a circus attraction of socially awkward ugliness than a human being. 

I would begin trying to find advice on how to not be a social outcast. I read that being confident is the most important thing, but I could never understand what the meaning of this was. Being nice and kind was another piece of advice, and something I understand. I would help struggling students with their work and quickly became known to be helpful. Teachers would even request that I step up to the board while they would run out of the room. Despite my attempts at being nice and friendly, people ignored me when I wasn't helping them with their schoolwork. On top of this, people would pressure me to tell them the answers on tests for school. Cheating makes me feel sick, so this led to me not being so eager to help people anymore.

When COVID-19 came around, I was refined to my house. I would go months without interacting with anyone outside of my dysfunctional family. I didn't have any online friends, and I didn't have any real-life friends. Everything seemed so lonely. 

This trend continues through today. I don't know how I will manage to get a job or have a family. I cannot even imagine myself outside of my parents' house. I get good grades, but I cannot even hold a conversation anymore. Stuttering habits have developed throughout COVID-19 due to my isolation. I've picked up some hobbies throughout COVID-19, but due to restrictions, I haven't been able to attend any events for these hobbies. 

I doubt anything will change in the future after COVID-19. I try to be hopeful for the future and continue waiting for the day that everything will make sense to me. I would try to do something to change my situation, but I don't know what I can do.",ever since little always remember alone preschool children would play amongst would play woodchips image protagonist cloudy chance meatballs would time play kid interactions limit remember one time kindergarten kid new school befriend hold birthday party year show school follow day presumably tell come busy anything want throughout elementary would try fit students always follow people versus lead one boy class charismatic would control majority people recess every year remember hop would get invite birthday party sometimes would sometimes would always feel sad leave invite throughout elementary partake sport scout help make friends fourth grade start feel like fit society society want either multiple time children would tell parent say hang feel warrant bad child disrespect adults use curse word none bad compare average child age always try civil nice people correct many issue christmas break year nothing change pattern rejection social outcast persist today would rarely get invite hang children age outside school either playdates birthday party would attend one school social event every three months fifth grade reach height social popularity last long become somewhat class clown teacher like horrible popular students grade think funny become friends still around time everyone start get cell phone never get cell phone understand appeal also despite school popularity never invite anything outside school sort kid people would talk class pass time outside limit circumstance reason talk social isolation grow drop extracurricular activities begin turn towards internet social interaction course use internet years play online game never try make connections people internet stop way simply play game love instead become drug social life desire minecraft develop many friendships course none long last soon stop play minecraft lose friends later start play terraria make new friends lead get discord even increase amount online friends none friends stick around many seem disappear fast appear best friend one month would enemy next would forget turn seemingly reason around time start develop misanthropic feel due loneliness matter could never seem get friends grow jealous others successes wonder grow get sad frustrate find username like name real life would lead people automatically hate people would hear rumor even give chance numerous discord servers ban things people hear many true spread stalkers people betray look solution problem think find begin make numerous alternate account would act differently start first account would say foreigner gain online social advantage least name hold anymore series alternate account lead make account male would claim female mainly curious would like female least act like female much reason act like foreigner grow amaze social success invite multiple discord servers would often invite play game people last long make sad know reason people friends personality anything act like female instill envy females view already advantage socially due female many less females online space hang accumulation gender dysphoria year sorry right term transgender people associate short term share feel mostly talk online part life past couple years life become socially isolate throughout middle school think invite one two party stable friends would even deliberately outcast people probably parent wish high school nice around lot new people throughout years social isolation even know make friends people seem already friend group set attention would get others would mockery males would mock front females friends give sarcastic compliment females would hold cameras face post social media laugh attractive person throughout life call ugly classmates family alike think safe assume people high school view circus attraction socially awkward ugliness human would begin try find advice social outcast read confident important thing could never understand mean nice kind another piece advice something understand would help struggle students work quickly become know helpful teachers would even request step board would run room despite attempt nice friendly people ignore help schoolwork top people would pressure tell answer test school cheat make feel sick lead eager help people anymore covid 19 come around refine house would go months without interact anyone outside dysfunctional family online friends real life friends everything seem lonely trend continue today know manage get job family even imagine outside parent house get good grade even hold conversation anymore stutter habit develop throughout covid 19 due isolation pick hobbies throughout covid 19 due restrictions able attend events hobbies doubt anything change future covid 19 try hopeful future continue wait day everything make sense would try something change situation know

sunflowersfascinate,lonely,1620421196.0,Outgrowing friends or am I pushing everyone away?,"It kind of is a hard pill to swallow, I don't know how I got this lonely.

I have a live in boyfriend whom I am in constant contact with. He is my best friend, truly believe my soulmate. He has quite a few friends who he can occupy his time with when we work opposite schedules. Aside from him and my one friend who I don't see often, I feel like my connections and friendships are superficial, no real depth. I feel like I overshare in most of my friendships and it is hard to develop bonds with people when they don't want to be vulnerable. 

My male friendships either end because they can't respect my boundaries or their girlfriends don't like them speaking to girls. One of my best friends since 12 (I am 30 now) stopped talking to me because his girlfriend wasn't okay with him having me as his friend even though I've been with my boyfriend over 7 years...

I have a hard time maintaining friendships with girls, I don't know how to bond with them honestly. Most girls I meet don't have much to talk about. I LOVE makeup but don't know how to have deep conversations with them about it. 

Along this journey I am realizing the type of friends I want to attract. Those who are into the things I am! From music, astrology, gaming. I also like to enjoy the beach, go to the movies and watch stand up.  I think because I lean introverted I get drained easily, so when I try explaining to my friends why I don't want to go out, I feel like an awful friend. Sometimes I would hang out of friends and not enjoy myself, but now I avoid situations that I won't enjoy.

Recently one of my friends stopped talking to me because I didn't show up to her boyfriend's event. I told her in advanced that I wanted to study instead of go out. I don't want to waste my energy on people being constantly passive aggressive anymore.

The old me was okay with friends who would complain or nag, I think I was breeding toxic habits and somewhat attracting the same energy.

I know there are like minded souls out there, just not sure where to begin meeting them! Feel free to drop me a DM :)

The way he laughed and the way he could talk me out of any bad mood that I had, I missed how we used to video call and how he always made sure to tell me how much he loved me and cared about me.

And even if i would meet a nice woman, about what should i talk with her? I'm a gamer, i like movies and books. How should i start the conversation? How should i keep the conversation going on? I'm introvert and not talkactive, the classic silent guy.

The routine never once changes, go to PT (Physical Training), show up to work, eat, work some more, go home, watch YouTube and think about how unhappy and lonely I am. I've almost come to accept that it will never change. I don't try to push people away, yet I still end up doing so. The effects of loneliness and isolation only recently started taking a toll on me, more so to the point that I've purchased a weighted blanket and body pillow so as to help with sleeping and combating the cold empty grip of loneliness. Giving up on finding companionship is about the only thing I think about these days. I truly do try to find that sense of companionship, but always find that in the end, others don't seem to share that want or need.

nobodyevencares4,lonely,1620163675.0,My teenagehood has been worthless," I'm 16. I've never been in a serious or relationship longer than a few  weeks, never kissed a girl, never even asked one out. I'm outgoing in  school and one of the smartest in my grade. People talk to me but I  can't remember the last time I've actually hung out with anybody. Nobody  and I mean nobody messages me first. I haven't messaged first in a few  months and all my dms are from ages ago. Nobody gives a shit. My best  friends all abandoned me when we got older. I have to put on a front in  school to not seem lonely so nobody thinks to look twice or ask to  hangout or nothing. I tried swaying the pain by making friends in online  games, however none of them have hit me up in weeks, it's clear they  only played with me because I was good at the game and didn't actually  care about me or my personality or anything. I give up. Basically my  entire teenagehood was wasted. No memories of going to the movies, no  first kisses, nothing. I really just want one friend man. I even try  going out of my way to talk to people but we talk for a bit and then  never talk again... So no true friends. Literally... I don't think I've  been invited to a gathering or hanging out since I was 11 or 12. My  games aren't fun any more. School work has become pointless. I don't  enjoy watching movies or TVs, or playing with my siblings. I get  obsessive thoughts in my head about bad things that I know I would never  do in any lifetime. I've become an asshole through this depression,  lashing out for stupid shit. I don't know the real me anymore. I just  want one real friend... I've even recently started opening up on social  media and shit and so many people view the ocasionnal despressing shit I  post yet a total of ZERO have responded. If my teenagehood has been  this fucking shit I am dreading my adulthood. I want to kill myself but I  don't want to die. I just want one good friend that I can laugh with  hangout with and do things with. I'm very extroverted so being this  alone has been the worst thing I have ever experienced. I can't even  listen to music anymore because I just don't feel it. I can't go to in  person school because it's full in person and my anxiety can't handle  that change and obviously COVID. If it were every other day I probably  could. I keep asking my mom for me to see a therapist or a counselor and  at first she's like yeah then makes excuses as to why I can't. I can't  even go bike riding out into town meeting new people because we live on a  hill in the middle of nowhere across a highway. Ubers aren't even  available.

frik4nd3lbr00dj3,lonely,1619983482.0,My Reddit bot can send you some random questions to talk about with your friends 🤖,"**TLDR:** u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t can send you a random question which you can ask to a friend. This means that, you'll need to find that friend first. If you have a friend you can also **!link** your chat to your friend's for some extra convenience. Send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&message=!question) to get started! Read further for more information.

&#x200B;

It can sometimes be difficult to come up with an interesting subject to talk about. It’s also great to sometimes talk about something completely random. This is why [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) now has a new feature that can help you with just that! You just ask for a random question and it will send it to you. It has a list of around 800 random questions, so there are plenty! For extra convenience it will also send the question to your friend, so you won’t even have to repeat the question in a different chat. However, you still have to answer the questions in another chat. The messages you send as a reply to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) WON’T be forwarded!

&#x200B;

**How to get started:**

Just send a [private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&subject=Chat%20with%20frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t&message=!question) with **!question** in the message field to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) (private message **isn't** the same as chat message!). The subject doesn't matter but if you want to use the bot with more than one friend I suggest you use different subjects so you can easily distinguish them.

&#x200B;

**The commands:**

After you've sent a message to [u/frik4nd3lbr00dj3\_b0t](https://www.reddit.com/user/frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t) and gotten a response, you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to that message. These commands all start with a ‘!’ as a prefix. These are the commands you could use:

&#x200B;

**!link**: Links chats between two users. The username of the person you want to link to has to be placed after **!link**.

**!unlink**: Removes !link.

**!question**: Gives you a question from the list. If no number is provided a random number will be drawn. The bot sends the question to both people when linked.

**!help**: Tries to help you.

**!feedback** Can be used to leave feedback. Please write your feedback after **!feedback**.

**!changelog**: Displays the changes made to this bot.

&#x200B;

If you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it's easier if both receive this question at the same time, so you won't have to repeat the question. So for example, you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. To achieve this, there has to be a link. This link can be achieved with the **!link** command. You and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. It's very easy. Just reply **!link** followed by the name of the person you want to link to. For example if you want to link to your friend username123:

`!link username123`

&#x200B;

You can request a random question by replying with **!question**. You could also add a number to the **!question** command to pick a question based on its number (If you have a lucky number for example). If you don’t provide a number, a random number will be drawn. The bot will also ensure you won’t pick the same question twice (it keeps track). If you're liked, you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. An example:

`!question`

or if you want to get a question based on its number:

`!question 123`

&#x200B;

The **!unlink** command will hopefully not be necessary, but it’s good to know that it exists. Like its name suggests, It removes the link between you and your friend. You should only use this when you DON’T want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. It will ONLY **!unlink** for this particular friend. If you also have links with other friends, they’ll will still remain. An example:

`!unlink`

&#x200B;

The **!help** command is pretty self-explanatory I guess… It displays all the commands and well… tries to help you with that. An example:

`!help`

&#x200B;

The **!feedback** enables you to leave feedback. If you have any tips or just want to help, feel free to use this command. You have to write the feedback after **!feedback.** If you for example want to let me know that I should add some more features:

`!feedback Please add some more features.`

&#x200B;

The **!changelog** command is probably not all that interesting for most people. An example:

`!changelog`

&#x200B;

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask them!

**Have fun :)**",tldr u frik4nd3lbr00dj3_b0t send random question ask friend mean need find friend first friend also link chat friend extra convenience send private message url get start read information x200b sometimes difficult come interest subject talk also great sometimes talk something completely random u frik4nd3lbr00dj3 _b0t url new feature help ask random question send list around nmbr random question plenty extra convenience also send question friend even repeat question different chat however still answer question another chat message send reply u frik4nd3lbr00dj3 _b0t url forward x200b get start send private message url question message field u frik4nd3lbr00dj3 _b0t url private message chat message subject matter want use bot one friend suggest use different subject easily distinguish x200b command send message u frik4nd3lbr00dj3 _b0t url get response send command bot reply message command start prefix command could use x200b link link chat two users username person want link place link unlink remove link question give question list number provide random number draw bot send question people link help try help feedback use leave feedback please write feedback feedback changelog display change make bot x200b friend want get random question bot easier receive question time win repeat question example take turn request question bot send question every time achieve link link achieve link command friend use command link together bot know reply easy reply link follow name person want link example want link friend username123 link username123 x200b request random question reply question could also add number question command pick question base number lucky number example provide number random number draw bot also ensure pick question twice keep track like friend receive question bot keep track number example question want get question base number question 123 x200b unlink command hopefully necessary good know exist like name suggest remove link friend use want receive reply bot regard friend unlink particular friend also link friends theyll still remain example unlink x200b help command pretty self explanatory guess display command well try help example help x200b feedback enable leave feedback tip want help feel free use command write feedback feedback example want let know add feature feedback please add feature x200b changelog command probably interest people example changelog x200b question hesitate ask fun

FlowRoc,lonely,1620341266.0,"So lonely, it feels like im freezing...","Lately i have been feeling more and more lonely, so much that i feel like i am freezing. 
It has been over a year since i exchanged words, written or spoken with my parents, because i was born in a culture i never wanted and that put me through abuse and alot of other things. 
My siblings never really tried to understand why i dont talk with my parents anymore, so communication has been kept at a minimum. 
My friends, if i can call them that anymore, well...havent even tried to be ""friends"" even if i tried to inniate anything. They only get in contact when they need something from me...
Relationships dont seem to even work out in the slightest, because it seems that i am ""too romantic"". Things start well because i got looks and ""being interesting"" going for me, but i havent had anything that lasted more than half a year.
I try to get through every day, but lately i cant do that anymore without having the urge to cry every night...but funny enough, im not able to cry at all, because i got raised to not cry, so i rarely shed tears, even if i wanted to...
I dont know why i am even writing this, i never wrote anything on reddit before. I struggle everyday to keep on going through this shitty life, but i keep on going, guess that its worth to mention that its because of animes like ""zetman"" (especially the quote ""keep your head up high, because you wont find hope lying on the ground"" or something like that).
The last time i talked with someone about this and told them how i feel...well they told me that i should stop living in self-pity...
When i talk to people close to me, i rarely get an answer that is ""understanding""...most of the replies i get are more ""condescending"" or trying to tell me to ""stop being/feeling like i do""...
I guess i just wish i had someone in my life who is would be truly interested in me and care about me...a little bit of warmth in this cold world...

,lonely,1619987003.0,I have no sexual or relationship experience after graduating college. I don't understand what I did wrong to not even be good enough for love and human affection. (22M),"I guess I can give a brief summary of my life so people know where Im coming from. Basically I have been lonely my whole life. I never really fit in anywhere and I’ve always felt like even the people I know I am not that close to.

I've done pretty well in school my whole life. I was valedictorian of my high school and I graduated a top 10 with a double major. I have the ultimate goal of pursuing an MD PhD to have a career in medical research and academic medicine. That being said I obviously know these things don't matter in finding love.

I struggled a lot in middle school and the first half of high school to find friends. Mostly everyone thought I was a nerd and a loser. I had the reputation of taking academics too seriously, even though I didn’t want to. I felt alienated from the “smart kids"" because I hated being viewed as a nerd and I also felt alienated from everyone else. This insecurity has never left me. I sincerely hate my intelligence and how hard I tried in school. It ended up amounting to nothing.

I was in a variety of clubs in high school and college. In hs I was in band (which I hated and quit 2 years into it) and speech and debate, where I made most of my friends in the latter half of high school. Even so, most of them thought of me as a loser and made fun of me for being a virgin. In all fairness I complained about being lonely at times. I felt alienated from them as well because of this.

In college I was in like 7 different clubs centered around service and medicine. I also joined a fraternity. I still had very few close friends in college. I had 0 female friends. I felt alienated from my fraternity a lot because I wasn’t hooking up with any women. I felt like I also wasn’t super crazy with drinking or partying.

Pretty much every social group I was in I never really felt a part of. I feel like I just dont belong anywhere. I am so lonely romantically I constantly fantasize about having a girlfriend that cares about me. I never asked to be valedictorian or go to a good college, the only thing I ever wanted in life was to feel loved and accepted. I don't even care that much about my career anymore. I'm just tired of being alone. I don't know what I did to deserve this.",guess give brief summary life people know im come basically lonely whole life never really fit anywhere ive always felt like even people know close pretty well school whole life valedictorian high school graduate top nmbr double major ultimate goal pursue md phd career medical research academic medicine say obviously know things matter find love struggle lot middle school first half high school find friends mostly everyone think nerd loser reputation take academics seriously even though want felt alienate smart kid hat view nerd also felt alienate everyone else insecurity never leave sincerely hate intelligence hard try school end amount nothing variety club high school college hs band hat quit nmbr years speech debate make friends latter half high school even think loser make fun virgin fairness complain lonely time felt alienate well college like nmbr different club center around service medicine also join fraternity still close friends college nmbr female friends felt alienate fraternity lot hook women felt like also super crazy drink party pretty much every social group never really felt part feel like belong anywhere lonely romantically constantly fantasize girlfriend care never ask valedictorian go good college thing ever want life feel love accept even care much career anymore tire alone know deserve

You feel like you got no one to trust cause you don't get the kind of responds that you'd want. You want to be someone's special/favorite but realize that you're no one in real life. You're aware that your life is degrading after you realize that the last person that you feel loved was your abuser. You wanna get out of your country but unable to cause you're unemployed and plain useless. All you do all day is watching films cause it's the only thing that keeps you alive, but you don't feel safe cause you got your inner that can't stop criticizing yourself for not being productive.

Doeofdajane0,lonely,1620029423.0,"it's my 20th birthday and I have no friends, and my family doesn't believe in birthdays because of their religious belief system so no celebration","it's my 20th birthday today and I have no friends, and my family doesn't believe in birthdays because of their religious belief system so no celebration, and I have been raised like a loner, brainwashed since young, a lot of bs I can't share, I feel so worthless, People around me (family shows that they care, you can tell the difference). this morning I felt so many feelings, like, now I'm not a teen, my first digit changed, regarding my virginity. when I came to my room after freshening up, looked out the window and thought that there's nothing more to live for, I have failed attempts and I don't wana do it, I know I won't do it so no worries, I feel like no one gives even a little bit of f about me, on a deeper level. I was raised in a way to think that girls are bad and nothing and a boy/male should never meet a girl, or have any kind of connections, even tho my parents dated and frikin got married, this lead to me having love for females in my brain but to feel accepted I showed what they wanted me to show and feel, my parents are so sexist but in a different way, both of them thinks that females are low, Idk im so sorry I am all over the place, idk what to say, to talk about. they never let me have any relationship, not consciously but by brainwashing me, plus the food they were providing was not healthy, just rice legumes and shitty cheap vegies (i hate cooked vegies), not much meat and proteins and good vitamin-mineral containing foods, but mostly we ate rice vig, tortillas with curd and shit like that(sorry not trying to offend, when u eat that shit for so long you'll too hate it), my cognition wasn't good in my childhood and most of my early teenage life, so I didn't understand much, plus we all used to go to sleep super late at night, and then they forced me to wake up at 3-4 am for prayer, which lead me to not doing okay at school, not mentioning all the mental illness (ocd adhd mild touretts  Hallucination )I developed from all this. (which is so bad that I haven't gotten accepted at any job I have applied, plus I feel so embarrassed to exist in a public place for my social anxiety), my dad was rich but didn't provided us with much and gave most of his money to his mom's dad. the house we live in right now is my mom's dad given house(maternal grandfather), and my mom didn't get a divorce even her therapist told her to, but because of the society and religious belief system she didn't get it, a few years ago my sister got a divorce and came to live with us in this small house, and she is evil, she cheated on her husband, got a divorce, came here, living with us with her kid, uses my mom work, eats here and cusses and swears at my mom, me, she also used to torture her kid when she(her child) was 2-4 years old by darkening her room, closing doors and windows and blasting horror sound and showing horror gore images to her child to make her sleep by yellig at her. so she came and because of her we had to get a big house on hi-rent for a temporary purpose and that caused me to leave school because it was too far from that house and other reasons, then they patched up then divorced again, now she has thrown her child at my mom n dad for care and shes working a job, and enjoying her self. there was a time in 2018 when I was finally getting better but that's when she came for the second time permanently and her negativity made everything a mess again.  I feel so like a trash bag being thrown here and there just like I'm nothing. I tried therapy, but it doesn't help. I always and still do, felt good about all the womens, but there's some out there, one like my sis, that are just pure evil, and dads just married my mom to use her as an object. I almost never felt loved by a girl at any age, and when I talked to my mum about it, she says ""you got me, you can love your mom"" in an evil tone, yea I can and I do love you mom, but there's a different kind of connection with a women whos not your own blood, but she doesn't understand this. I just hate them all now, so much, Idk why I wrote such a long-ass post, I am not feeling anything, sorry if you don't agree with me, and please correct me if I'm wrong. living life is just so hard for me now, that I just cant explain it, I don't want to exist, but I have failed so many times while attempting it and I don't wana feel that pain again anymore.. I feel so less of a human. im not asking for anything just felt like writing this here so Ill feel a bit light but it isn't helping. and I am sorry if i came of a bit rude, I cant talk when im high on emotions so sorry if i offended anyone of you.

BudgetKaleidoscope1,lonely,1620059160.0,I have never hung out with friends,"For a good portion of my highschool career I spent all my breaks in the library watching YouTube.

At this point I've given up and and wish I stayed in the library even though these kids made fun of me for it. 

Here's the thing, I have never done any sort of ""typical teenager"" thing. Haven't gone on dates, hung out with friends or even held hands with someone I like. I feel as though I'm wasting these valuable years (16F). What makes it worse is that every time I open social media I see my peers do these things. Having fun. I literally just go to school and then go straight home. 

I have 3 online friends which makes it better I suppose.

awkwardbean04,lonely,1620124685.0,The worst luck with girls,"Ok so basically I have tried to purse 5 relationships with girls that ik are into me at least just lil and they all crash and burn in a short amount of time. Im 17 m btw. With all this being said I kinda feel worthless and not successful as a man. I have really good qualities too ( at least I think). I am honest,funny,not bad looking,confident,and fun. I also have some bad qualities too, such as I can be a dick on accident a-lot, Im short (5’6), and I can be awkward sometimes. Every situation where Im starting to talk to a girl I really think I have a chance. Then things take a U turn. I will give u a couple examples. I was dating this girl for literally a week and we were really good friends before, so we connected. Then all of the sudden she dumps me for another guy. Another example is the most recent one (reason i’m writing this post). This story is really fucked btw. So I was scrolling on snap one day and added a ton of people. I then added a light-skin girl that wanted to know me. We met up and we instantly connected. By the 4th time we hung out she kissed me and we were flirting heavily. She was sitting on my lap and shit and touching me a-lot so I thought I was about to have someone. Then we hang out for the 5th time and she was acting extremely moody. When I first get there she gets her brother or someone to tell me if I hurt her he will beat tf out of me. I was confused cuz we weren’t dating. After that she calls a friend and her friend starts talking about me. She asks if Im her bf and she immediately says nooo as if Im disgusting. She then said I was a bad kisser ( even though it was a peck). I felt kinda hurt by that so I asked her what I did wrong. She didn’t answer me so I asked a couple more times. She then starts to call another friend so I put my headphones in. She got offended by this and asked why I did it. I ignored her and shortly after I said y’all hear sum as a joke. She immediately gets mad and says shes going home. I tell her sorry but she keeps walking. I then apologize on snap when I get home but she leaves me on open. 30 min later her brother starts texting me on her account saying I fucked up and he was gonna beat tf out of me. I was so blown away by this because all I did was a stupid joke. Then after that she sent me a snap saying bae’s streaks. I think she had a bf the whole time or she wants me to back off. All I know is that hurt me for a bit until the brother came in and I was like this girl is crazy. Tell me what u guys think. Was I in the wrong or was she. Also if u pm me I will drop a pic so u can tell me if Im ugly or not. Some people think I am and others don’t. I think I dont look too bad but idk anymore.

zinoria,lonely,1620525267.0,Happy Birthday to me.,"Hello all. My birthday was last night (8th May).

In light of the ongoing global pandemic situation, my country is under controlled movement with restrictions so technically we  have to stay home. Anyhow, my birthday has been very depressing since I got kicked out from my relative's house in my late teens. I never have a chance to celebrate and feel special.  Social media is not an ideal platform for me to vent. I always feel that these people are more fortunate than me. I don't have many friends, had an abusive ex (I left him, Thank God).

I would love to share cake slices. I would love to receive presents. I would love to share my happiness with anyone on my birthday. I just want to feel special. I never have a chance. I am lonely. Internet keeps me entertained. I don't feel... acknowledged. 

To my surprise, not many people I know remember my birthday last night and I was saddened by the fact that people treat me like a stranger. My close friend forgotten to send a birthday wish but ended up, texted me when saw me online, ""Happy Birthday, zinoria. Sorry for the Covid thing has happened so I hope you stay alive out there."" That's reassuring enough.

My life is a joke. My birthday is supposed to be a day which I should feel happy about it. Sometimes I feel that I shouldn't be alive.",hello birthday last night 8th may light ongoing global pandemic situation country control movement restrictions technically stay home anyhow birthday depress since get kick relative house late teens never chance celebrate feel special social media ideal platform vent always feel people fortunate many friends abusive ex leave thank god would love share cake slice would love receive present would love share happiness anyone birthday want feel special never chance lonely internet keep entertain feel acknowledge surprise many people know remember birthday last night sadden fact people treat like stranger close friend forget send birthday wish end texted saw online happy birthday zinoria sorry covid thing happen hope stay alive reassure enough life joke birthday suppose day feel happy sometimes feel alive

imonabloodbuzz,lonely,1620266501.0,She’s probably forgotten about me. Meanwhile I’d do anything to receive just one “good morning” text from her,"I’m emotionally weak. I know.

I recently met a girl online after giving online dating one last try. We hit if off immediately. We had so much to talk about over text. It was the first time a woman took genuine interest in me in my 25 years on Earth or so I thought.

We went on our first date. It felt like reconnecting with an old best friend. We walked 9 miles together, we had so much to say. She was funny, kind, thoughtful and gorgeous. She had the most unbelievable eyes. Yet she was going out with me, a socially awkward and average looking virgin. We didn’t need to discuss whether we wanted a second date, it was assumed. Same thing with the third date. And the fourth. No sex, but I had my first kiss ever with her.

We’d send hundreds of texts a day. About dinner, work, or whatever. She’d say good morning every day because she got up earlier. We’d share songs, podcasts and actually listen and discuss them. Some of her recs were totally of no interest to me, but I listened for her. 

I learned about her small midwestern hometown, her uncle’s war stories, and her favorite candies. I told her about my elderly dog back home and what instrument I played in middle school.

Things just fell apart on the fourth date. After a few hours of great conversation she dropped the hammer on me with the “i’m not ready for a relationship and idk why I’m dating” lines. I was shellshocked. It came out of nowhere. There was nothing I said that she reacted badly to that I remember. She INSISTED on paying for drinks on several dates and did, I wasn’t being used as a meal ticket. 

She told her parents and sister about me and she even got express shipping on a dress once because she wanted to wear it to our date. We had 100 different dates planned. And she just ended it..poof.

Weeks after this ended, I’m in a constant state of emotional torment. Sometimes I have to take a break from work (wfh) to cry in my bed. I get excited when I receive a text for a split second when I hope it’s her but it’s always someone else. It’s only gotten worse.

I deleted her social media, number and our text convos. It hasn’t helped. Time hasn’t healed it, it’s gotten worse. I see friends and focus on work but I just think of her the entire time. I’m in therapy. And God, don’t tell me I need to “hit the gym”. I’m a long distance runner and have run 4+ miles every day for 5 years. 

I’m autistic, severely depressed, and anxious. I had accepted I’d be alone but I thought there was maybe a way out when I met her. I can’t do this and date again. It hurts too much. I wish I had never met her.",im emotionally weak know recently meet girl online give online date one last try hit immediately much talk text first time woman take genuine interest nmbr years earth think go first date felt like reconnecting old best friend walk nmbr miles together much say funny kind thoughtful gorgeous unbelievable eye yet go socially awkward average look virgin need discuss whether want second date assume thing third date fourth sex first kiss ever wed send hundreds texts day dinner work whatever shed say good morning every day get earlier wed share songs podcast actually listen discuss recs totally interest listen learn small midwestern hometown uncles war stories favorite candy tell elderly dog back home instrument play middle school things fell apart fourth date hours great conversation drop hammer im ready relationship idk im date line shellshocked come nowhere nothing say react badly remember insist pay drink several date use meal ticket tell parent sister even get express ship dress want wear date nmbr different date plan end poof weeks end im constant state emotional torment sometimes take break work wfh cry bed get excite receive text split second hope always someone else get worse delete social media number text convos help time heal get worse see friends focus work think entire time im therapy god tell need hit gym im long distance runner run 4 miles every day nmbr years im autistic severely depress anxious accept id alone think maybe way meet cant date hurt much wish never meet

ScrumptiousCookie123,lonely,1620423186.0,Finally found out why I’m alone.,"I found out that a group of people I used to know and grew up with conspired together, and ran me through the mud in a smear campaign. They impersonated me on Twitter and other social media platforms. At the time, I didn’t have any social media accounts. So I had no idea what was going on. I had no idea why others were angry/disappointed/disgusted/hateful/embarrassed with me. I didn’t understand why I was being scapegoated/ostracized/excluded. Everyone kept insisting that I needed to apologize. For what?! They wouldn’t even tell me what I did wrong. They would keep it super vague and say that I would disrespect everyone but demand others to respect me - in reference to the straw man impersonation they made of my identity. I never asked anyone to respect me. I was getting bullied, had no idea why, and couldn’t even defend myself. I simply was not allowed to defend myself.

I found out too late, and the damage was already done. Before I could make an account to report them on Twitter, they made sure to delete the tweets and deactivate those accounts. I wouldn’t be surprised if they made private impersonating accounts afterwards so I couldn’t see what was being posted.

They would use impersonating accounts to start fights, spread rumors/misinformation, and to misrepresent who I am as a person. 
Then, the same people who were impersonating me used their own accounts to refute/rebuttal the imposter/impersonating account - all to make themselves look like the “bigger person” and paint themselves in a better light. They would pretend to have “empathy” and “grace” when dealing with the straw man version of myself. 

I have so many questions...
Why are some people so awful? Why are some people so disingenuous?And why did people actually believe those impersonating accounts? Why didn’t people confront me in person and say anything about it? Why did people keep it hush, hush, and do all this behind my back? Why did it have to be me? I didn’t do anything to these people.

Experiencing this only brought me distrust and dislike people more. It also pushed me to write people off and generalize “everyone” as terrible, even though I know this isn’t true and there are good people out there. I feel super disheartened by this. 

The worst part is, even after being abused and done wrong by these individuals, I’m being medically pathologized/demonized/vilified as a “psychopath”, “narcissist”, “sociopath”, “borderline”, etc. I don’t have any of these diagnoses. They still go out of their way to make me out to be “evil” or an awful person who hurts others.

In reality, I’m socially withdrawn and “anti-social” (even though I’m sociable and friendly), because I’m super traumatized by what they put me through; I’m diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety.",find group people use know grow conspire together run mud smear campaign impersonate twitter social media platforms time social media account idea go idea others angry disappoint disgust hateful embarrass understand scapegoated ostracize exclude everyone keep insist need apologize even tell wrong would keep super vague say would disrespect everyone demand others respect reference straw man impersonation make identity never ask anyone respect get bully idea even defend simply allow defend find late damage already could make account report twitter make sure delete tweet deactivate account surprise make private impersonate account afterwards see post would use impersonate account start fight spread rumor misinformation misrepresent person people impersonate use account refute rebuttal imposter impersonate account make look like bigger person paint better light would pretend empathy grace deal straw man version many question people awful people disingenuous people actually believe impersonate account people confront person say anything people keep hush hush behind back anything people experience bring distrust dislike people also push write people generalize everyone terrible even though know true good people feel super dishearten worst part even abuse wrong individuals im medically pathologized demonize vilify psychopath narcissist sociopath borderline etc diagnose still go way make evil awful person hurt others reality im socially withdraw anti social even though im sociable friendly im super traumatize put im diagnose major depressive disorder generalize anxiety
lil-ice-monkey,lonely,1619888356.0,loneliness and stupid strong gal identity,"I \[F27\] identify so much with being ""a strong person"" that it has destroyed any chances of me getting what I really need - real human relationship, compassion, and support. I always attract traumatized people that need a lot from me emotionally and are unable to give back - as soon as I open up and take my armor off, I'm disposed of. I keep attracting them because essentially, it confirms my base belief - I am not worth anything, if not for my ability to help and support others, solve complex problems, be the ""sensible"" one.  


Multiple therapists have sent me home (aka ""I don't think you need another session"") because I appear to have my shit together, life is going on and my only problem, according to them, is that ""I am not accepting that feelings are normal"". Well, how could I, if nobody wants me if I have feelings? And I end the sessions because I'm so damn fucked in my head that I can't even let the therapist down for some reason.

I am not even ME anymore, so the phrase ""put yourself first"" makes no sense to me. I can't connect with anyone or anything. I look back at my life and any human relationship I have ever had seems like a temporary trip. I simply play the role everyone wants me to play - I am the one who ""puts things in order when they get out of order"".

I'm so lonely, I come home, cry and (secretly) drink myself to sleep. I've tried telling people I need support, but I just don't get taken seriously, because my image and *despair* don't go together well. I can't stop doing things actively, because I'm afraid that I might just kill myself if I stop doing things. I don't even know how to show people how lonely I am, and I'm almost 100% sure there is no chance of a good outcome.

How nice life would be if I had someone to relate to and share with. I just want to be cuddled up in a blanket. I just want someone to say ""I'll take care of everything"" and for me to be able to believe it. The more I think about it, the more impossible it seems. This doesn't even make any sense.

KSenniaV,lonely,1620486507.0,Is love and acceptance from others vital for happiness?,"I don't know the answer to that. I was trying to help someone, the other day, by taking this tack of, ""you have deep needs that aren't being met, but other people can't actually meet those needs for you. You need to heal yourself.""

But I don't know if that's how it works. 

Is it possible for a person to be enough by themselves? Can they be happy and content and meet all of their own needs internally?

Or are there certain needs that can only be met by others? 

I learned from the Lifetime movie ""Child of Rage"", which was based on a true story about child killers, that attachment to our mothers or some other permanent caregiver in childhood is necessary for us to learn how to love, trust, and develop a conscience. 

So maybe love and approval from others is required, and we can't meet our own internal needs by ourselves.

I'm not sure.

I only feel lonely sometimes. It comes and it goes. But I've always been a loner who enjoys observing other people and making up stories about them in my head. 

But I have Aspergers (Autism Spectrum), so I've always struggled with communication and connecting with other people. 

I genuinely want to help people, but sometimes I can be off, or get really lecturey, or be too analytical. Or I'll just say the wrong thing and offend, unintentionally. Or I'll be too clingy, come on too strong, and drive people away. 

It just happens. Communication disorders are like that. I do try every day to learn and grow because learning and growing is my life's purpose. 

For me, I just kind of accepted a long time ago that I am not socially acceptable, and that most people won't like me, and that I'll never fit in, no matter which group I join. 

So I guess that has sort of innoculated me from the desperation of having friends or lovers. I'm also asexual, so I don't have that urge to procreate or have sex. I'm sure for sexual people who have that urge it must be a lot harder if you have trouble finding partners. 

When I was younger, I actually was quite desperate to find one person who loved me best. That was the thing I wanted most in the world. Then I had a wonderful fantasy relationship with someone that couldn't ever have actually happened because I didn't possess the actual abilities to make it happen.

But I got to experience what it was like to be in love and to believe someone else loved me, and to pretend I had a certain type of future. 

At the time I believed I was at the height of my existence. I didn't believe anything could ever live up to or surpass the love I'd felt. I became absolutely obsesses with this person, she was my entire world. Nothing else mattered other than her, and when she broke up with me, once she realized I wasn't real, I didn't think I could ever be happy again.

I very dramatically cried every day for two years, I talked about it constantly. I couldn't think about anything else. I think partly because of my autsyism, but also maybe that's normal-ish? *shrugs*

I don't know. It's been ten years. I'm alone and glad of it. I read the relationship subs and there is sooo much drama and angst and horrible things that happen. I'm thankful I can be independent, and that I'm not tied down to anyone. 

Maybe it's my age. I'm 38. So middle-aged, or very close. I know that the relationship/family thing was never going to be mine, and I kind of struggle to understand now why other people want it so desperately?

Is it an age thing?
A Society thing? Peeps grow up seeing that others are all coupled up and having families, so they feel like they have to have that, too?
Is it a biological imperative?
Is it a deep psychological need?

Do most people need to be loved and accepted by others before they can love and accept themselves? 

Or is it possible to meet all of our internal needs ourselves? 

I still have no idea. And I have a broken brain, so I have no idea how it works for the normal-brained. (Neuro-typical)

But anyhow, I mostly wanted to apologize, in case I give anyone really bad advice. It's not my intention to be hurtful. I really just want to understand. And because I don't understand, I may some stupid shit that doesn't make any sense. Maybe the next thing I say will be smart. :D",know answer try help someone day take tack deep need meet people actually meet need need heal know work possible person enough happy content meet need internally certain need meet others learn lifetime movie child rage base true story child killers attachment mother permanent caregiver childhood necessary us learn love trust develop conscience maybe love approval others require meet internal need sure feel lonely sometimes come go always loner enjoy observe people make stories head aspergers autism spectrum always struggle communication connect people genuinely want help people sometimes get really lecturey analytical say wrong thing offend unintentionally clingy come strong drive people away happen communication disorder like try every day learn grow learn grow life purpose kind accept long time ago socially acceptable people win like never fit matter group join guess sort innoculated desperation friends lovers also asexual urge procreate sex sure sexual people urge must lot harder trouble find partner younger actually quite desperate find one person love best thing want world wonderful fantasy relationship someone ever actually happen possess actual abilities make happen get experience like love believe someone else love pretend certain type future time believe height existence believe anything could ever live surpass love felt become absolutely obsess person entire world nothing else matter break realize real think could ever happy dramatically cry every day two years talk constantly think anything else think partly autsyism also maybe normal ish shrug know ten years alone glad read relationship sub sooo much drama angst horrible things happen thankful independent tie anyone maybe age 38 middle age close know relationship family thing never go mine kind struggle understand people want desperately age thing society thing peep grow see others couple families feel like biological imperative deep psychological need people need love accept others love accept possible meet internal need still idea break brain idea work normal brain neuro typical anyhow mostly want apologize case give anyone really bad advice intention hurtful really want understand understand may stupid shit make sense maybe next thing say smart

Geodude074,lonely,1620128387.0,Last Action Hero was Arnold’s best movie ever,"Yes it was even better than T2. No I’m not joking. Hear me out.

LAH was an action comedy that frequently broke the fourth wall and was a completely original masterpiece that was also a parody of itself and was way ahead of its time. It had Tywin Lannister as the bad guy, Random Task as the henchman, a literal cartoon cat as a cop, a freaking Shakespeare skit, and of course Arnold as the wise cracking never ending source of dad jokes.

Look at the most successful action movies of the past decades i.e. Marvel, they’re all action comedies. The best ones are self aware and make fun of themselves and their own characters. The heroes are as humorous as they are ass-kicking, and the bad guys are literal comic book villains. LAH was simply ahead of its time, born in an age where action movies had to be serious, the audience of the 90s wasn’t ready for a comedic action hero Arnold.

It’s a shame LAH got stomped at the box office by Jurassic Park. It was completely original and never got a sequel. And because it never became a franchise that Hollywood could milk bone dry, LAH will always be a pure, golden 90s action parody, a timeless classic.",yes even better t2 im joke hear lah action comedy frequently break fourth wall completely original masterpiece also parody way ahead time tywin lannister bad guy random task henchman literal cartoon cat cop freak shakespeare skit course arnold wise crack never end source dad joke look successful action movies past decades e marvel theyre action comedies best ones self aware make fun character heroes humorous ass kick bad guy literal comic book villains lah simply ahead time bear age action movies serious audience 90s ready comedic action hero arnold shame lah get stomp box office jurassic park completely original never get sequel never become franchise hollywood could milk bone dry lah always pure golden 90s action parody timeless classic

Psychological_Job_97,lonely,1620550799.0,Quarantine loneliness affecting productivity. How do you all cope up?,"Been feeling lonely lately. I live alone in a big city. I go to work twice a week even though I can have the option to work from home. It just makes me feel better to see other people and sometimes my work friends. I want to go home, 500 miles away and gotta take a plane, but I don't have a space to work peacefully there and my dad's having extramarital issues. I'm still angry with him. My mom works abroad. I got no sibs. My SO and I would exchange messages and eventually she'd be busy. Of course, that's fine she's got a life too you know. I kinda hate myself for needing other people's presence just to be fine. 

Several holidays passed already and I badly wanna spend it with family or close friends but with the strict pandemic protocols, I can't do it. It has been like this for more than a year. I'm seeing a therapist to somehow work things out (loneliness, family issues, etc). She said I've been improving real great. Yet, there are times like this I just feel lonely. No friend to contact because they have a life too. After a year of lockdowns, seems like everybody's moved on already. 

I have lots of time in my hands but I can't use it productively esp on weekends where I intend to use it for studying(I'm also in grad school, part time). On days I go to work physically, I'm super productive. I miss my pre-pandemic self. Working on a full time and a part time job while taking classes for grad school. Writing papers to submit on conferences and journals. I feel bad about myself for being unproductive despite all the tools and opportunities available. It's just I couldn't bring myself to it. 

'I'm starting to think people who are still functioning well in this pandemic are those who are blessed to be with their families and surrounded by love.",feel lonely lately live alone big city go work twice week even though option work home make feel better see people sometimes work friends want go home nmbr miles away got ta take plane space work peacefully dad extramarital issue still angry mom work abroad get sibs would exchange message eventually busy course fine get life know kinda hate need people presence fine several holiday pass already badly wan na spend family close friends strict pandemic protocols like year see therapist somehow work things loneliness family issue etc say improve real great yet time like feel lonely friend contact life year lockdowns seem like everybody move already lot time hand use productively esp weekend intend use study also grad school part time days go work physically super productive miss pre pandemic self work full time part time job take class grad school write paper submit conferences journals feel bad unproductive despite tool opportunities available bring start think people still function well pandemic bless families surround love
novacaine21,lonely,1620582548.0,I feel extremely lonely when I'm with my close.family.,"I, 24m, am staying with my family of mom and sis, during the entirety of the COVID enforced lockdowns at my place. I'm not really used to spending so much time with them, as I grew up away from home (in residential schools) when I was 14 or so. Having an abandoned father didn't help much either for the dysfunctional family. Naturally, I felt more at ease and at home when I'm surronded by my friends than I felt when I was with family and relatives.

So, when I going back to my family, its like visiting a relative or something. The first few days its all well and good. But then later on, actual feelings start to surface. This deep melancholy and a feeling that I'm truly alone even though I'm with my close family. It gets worse when my mom starts to complain that I'm not smiling or talking much or whatever.

Now without any idea on how long I'm going to be locked up here, it gets even sadder day by day.",24m stay family mom sis entirety covid enforce lockdowns place really use spend much time grow away home residential school nmbr abandon father help much either dysfunctional family naturally felt ease home surronded friends felt family relatives go back family like visit relative something first days well good later actual feel start surface deep melancholy feel truly alone even though close family get worse mom start complain smile talk much whatever without idea long go lock get even sadder day day
LostSouluk2021,lonely,1620425483.0,Below average means invisible in this society," If your below the conventional standard of perceived beauty you're essentially a ghost in this society, at least for many people. Any perceived flaw in your physical or mental makeup be it weight, height, skin, big nose, depression, schizophrenia etc is considered a deformity, maybe not overtly so but subconsciously it's how you're perceived. Age is also a factor because that's tied to appearance. There's definitely a subconscious prejudice against older people and if you're in a care home then expect to be patronised like you're a toddler by the 20 something care lady.  


Yet society won't tell you any of this. Society exists in a bubble of ignorance to maintain the ""perfect picture"". Sure mental health doesn't discriminate against even the most attractive people but society is still in their favour based on shallow preconceptions. Confidence and status can maybe defy any physical shortcomings but this life in general is so much bleak for people who are below average in some form or another.",conventional standard perceive beauty essentially ghost society least many people perceive flaw physical mental makeup weight height skin big nose depression schizophrenia etc consider deformity maybe overtly subconsciously perceive age also factor tie appearance definitely subconscious prejudice older people care home expect patronise like toddler nmbr something care lady yet society win tell society exist bubble ignorance maintain perfect picture sure mental health discriminate even attractive people society still favour base shallow preconceptions confidence status maybe defy physical shortcomings life general much bleak people average form another
AnonPinkLady,lonely,1620284805.0,"Loneliness is a bearable but constant ache, heartbreak is a brief but overwhelming agony","This seems to be the reason I never end up escaping the clutches of loneliness and putting myself back out there. It hurts all the time and in the grand scheme of things it's a much greater amount of pain to endure but its seems so slight, moment to moment, that I feel as if I can endure it. Mean while putting myself out there could mean happiness for a moment but if I get hurt and shot down, a much sharper more difficult pain even if it's short lived. Which is why I cant help fearing it. I'd compare loneliness to a chronic soreness in your muscles, while heart ache is a sudden stunning slap to the face. One hurts in a gradual way that doesnt make you feel startled or suddenly aware of it. The other is immediately and dizzying. You remember it. You fear it. Even though it's not as frequent as the dull ache, it's so much more obvious and unforgettable. So you choose the dull ache indefinitely, for days... months... years... you hurt. It's not your fault, its instinct to fear the slap more. But I wish I had the bravery, myself, to face it again.",seem reason never end escape clutch loneliness put back hurt time grand scheme things much greater amount pain endure seem slight moment moment feel endure mean put could mean happiness moment get hurt shoot much sharper difficult pain even short live cant help fear compare loneliness chronic soreness muscle heart ache sudden stun slap face one hurt gradual way make feel startle suddenly aware immediately dizzy remember fear even though frequent dull ache much obvious unforgettable choose dull ache indefinitely days months years hurt fault instinct fear slap wish bravery face
Werbezeugvu,lonely,1620117961.0,Can I meet someone on the internet who will like me?,"Hi, I (25m) have been lonely my entire life. I had a couple of relationships with a few girls for a short time, but it didn't end well. In fact, I was riducled by them because of my timidity and devotion to them. Yeah, I guess it was pretty weird for them to talk with me.

&#x200B;

I understand that my main issue is that I'm too sensitive, and women around me don't like it all. I get attached to people easily and am an open book when it comes to my feelings, sadly often not thinking about the consequences. I don't wanna wait a long time to become an important person in one's life, so girls tend to consider me too intense and ghost me. Just can't control this. One of my ex-GFs told me that I will never be happy if I continue being like this, and she's probably right. I was trying to change my personality to become less sensitive, but it didn't help much. I can't fix my romantic nature, and it seems I never will.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I don't think I need to be so depressed about it. I have a very cool job, I travel a lot, and I'm in great shape. I think it would be great to find someone who will accept my personality. But I don't really know from where to begin. I've never used dating websites to meet anyone, even Tinder, because I know they're full of fakes or scammers. I guess most of you will understand what I'm talking about. The only thing I ever used for searching someone was [hubite.com](https://hubite.com) to find some girls in my locations who make kind of sensitive pics. It was just for fun and I didn't mean to talk with them or smth like that.

&#x200B;

I'm too skeptical about dating websites, but maybe I should give them a chance. What do you think? Should I try to find someone there or it's better to meet people IRL?",hi 25m lonely entire life couple relationships girls short time end well fact riducled timidity devotion yeah guess pretty weird talk x200b understand main issue sensitive women around like get attach people easily open book come feel sadly often think consequences wan na wait long time become important person one life girls tend consider intense ghost control one ex gfs tell never happy continue like probably right try change personality become less sensitive help much fix romantic nature seem never x200b anyway think need depress cool job travel lot great shape think would great find someone accept personality really know begin never use date websites meet anyone even tinder know full fake scammers guess understand talk thing ever use search someone hubite com url find girls locations make kind sensitive pics fun mean talk smth like x200b skeptical date websites maybe give chance think try find someone better meet people irl

I tried college and didn’t work as my mother wouldn’t let me move to be closer to it, she would let me do anything but keep her home with her.

I went into a long term relationship and had my son. 11 years I spent with him and only my son to show for it. No engagement no home nothing. I was done I was miserable as was he but refused to admit. Wasn’t til after we broke up I realised how manipulative and toxic he was. And he made my life miserable. 

From there it’s getting worse. I don’t wanna be here anymore but don’t want to leave my son.

I can't talk to people, my sentences are stiff and conversations with me are dry. I don't know how to express emotions properly and people don't want that. It's hard to initiate a conversation, and I've been told I have an awkward vibe around me. I don't want to put that kind of baggage on a friend.

There’s only one person who checks up on me, that’s my mom. I’m very thankful for that, but it sucks because the rest of my family could care less about how I’m doing. It almost feels uncomfortable talking to my mom sometimes because of that. I just don’t feel good vibes from anyone either. If I do, it’s super temporary.

So over the weekend I found out my wife had a threesome years ago (4/5) with a close group friend We’ll call him (H) I shouldn’t care but it’s that I got this information from his brother who told me as if everyone knew about this, I confront my wife about it and she admits it but is shook on how I found out. At the time when that happened we weren’t together, we were broken up and she says it was a drunk mistake, I can get passed it happened a long time ago but I trusted this guy with my own kids literally. His wife (who also knew about this cause he told her) and all these years I see H and just the thought now that I would be at work and they would come over. My biggest problem was that it was kept away but I feel like everyone knew but me, his brother ended up telling H, all of our group friends as well and now they all know (it’s like 8 of us) I’m shook to my core because to this day they are really close friends and it makes it worse cause H asked my wife to be his best man (weird choice) I asked my wife if she was still going to be in H’s wedding as the best man and she said yes. I’m so conflicted because at times I let it go and I feel okay but sometimes my thoughts get terrible and I go down in a spiral and she doesn’t exactly comfort too well, I was in my feelings and I said something I regret but before I could tell her I didn’t mean it she responded with a worse comment and it started an argument. I don’t feel like she cares about any of this about how it’s affecting me in my head and all those things she said in our argument I took to heart. Now everything just sucks and I’m just mad all together and hurt. Sorry if it’s complicated I just don’t know what to say or if I’m in the wrong. Again my problem was that I found out now, my wife asked me for all my experiences when we weren’t together and I asked her and she didn’t bring this up.

From few months, I’m surfing reddit alot and found eventually a dating sub reddit. I’m horrible in real life dating even though im lil attractive but still I couldn’t get into any relationship because im very shy. You don’t know the level of shyness. I thought of finding some serious relationship and someone kind girl and someone who can love me from his heart on reddit and I actually got quite good response but after few days girls don’t give efforts in communication and they get ghost. I feel really sad when im the only one who messages them. They won’t care even if I don’t message them. They won’t even message me first and give replies after an hours so I dropped on them. I found so many such girls who don’t give efforts in communication. Now the main part is im addicted toward seeing messages. In every 15 mins i check my reddit and discord to see if someone message me or not. I just keep waiting for someone to message me and no one messages me. I feel really lonely. My dating intention isn’t wrong. I just want one girl who can care for me and message me but I couldn’t find them. Every morning i woke up i open my discord and reddit to see if anyone sent me message or not. Idk it’s depression or not but i def feel really lonely. My life is pretty good. I got many people care for me but because of that im losing my one genuine friend also. I just try to keep my face happy but from deep down i feel void in my heart.

z3brother,lonely,1620415132.0,Just need to vent,"My earliest memory is from when I was 3 years old, sitting alone on the bench at school watching everyone else play together. When my best friend walked by I called out his name but he kept ignoring me, covering his ears with his hands. I’m not blaming a 3 year old here, I just remember feeling invisible.

I have no siblings and my parents are workaholics that don’t stop after their long hours. My wider family are extroverts, so I just fade into the background.

I had quite a lot of friends in my early teens, but we grew apart. I spent most of my mid-late teens alone, whether it was in my room, at school, in public or going to events.

I’m now in university and I’ve been noticing how alone I am recently. Today was like any other day: I left the house without talking to anyone, I got the bus alone, I sat alone in my lecture, I ate lunch alone despite two of my sort-of-friends being close by. I went home alone, my parents asked how my day was but they didn’t really listen, I ate dinner alone, and now i’m in my room alone.

I thought there was something wrong with me, so I lost a lot of weight, cut and dyed my hair, got cosmetic work done, changed my style and just pretended to be someone else.
I hate myself, absolutely detest everything about myself inside and out now. I’m in so much pain that I just don’t feel pain anymore really. I don’t expect anything from anyone anymore, I just exist. 

I am so tired of it and I feel like it’s never going to change, I have tried many times, failed and tried again so many times but nothing ever works.

EquivalentWest5678,lonely,1620381257.0,The package and the hole,"(This is not a confession, nor mine. I am simply curious what people think about someone who would right this.)

I spent years of my life, my primary, my secondary; dreaming and conceptually asking for a lie. The few things that gave me happiness were nothing more than little packages that promised on their surface to give me that which I had not had for most of my life as a student. As soon as I opened these packages I realized all the disgusting things they had inside, it was not only the same indifference, ignorance and impurity that I had tried to disregard throughout my life, but also, it was the celebration and appreciation of all these things I had hated. The worst of the case is that I had asked for that miserable package and I do not know if it was out of fear or the lack of interest with which I had become used to living my days that I did not open the door to receive it until what it contained was irretrievably expired. I wonder if in the future it will be for me, as for so many people that once time passes and the contents of the package are fermented in a substance that causes them the same illusion of happiness that my dreams of the future caused me, that I will finally appreciate the false happiness brought by the pleasant lie that temporarily fills that very hole in which we will end up. The same hole that has been my home for a long time, where I have found some tranquility and calm, this hole has the name of loneliness. It is easier to hide in the darkness of this hole where my dreams and fantasies are perfect than to go outside where imperfections are so revered. Once in a while like a diver whose oxygen tank runs out, I would go outside to breathe, but when I did I was naturally so disappointed that I dug that hole more and more. I isolated myself to such an extent that those who originally saw me dig my hole with indifference, now whispered to each other and began to mock that lonely miserable digging his hole. It is incredible the fear that causes me to get out of that hole to meet the expectations of those who laugh, even though I don't like to think about it, I wonder: if I continue digging this hole will it be my grave?",confession mine simply curious people think someone would right spend years life primary secondary dream conceptually ask lie things give happiness nothing little package promise surface give life student soon open package realize disgust things inside indifference ignorance impurity try disregard throughout life also celebration appreciation things hat worst case ask miserable package know fear lack interest become use live days open door receive contain irretrievably expire wonder future many people time pass content package ferment substance cause illusion happiness dream future cause finally appreciate false happiness bring pleasant lie temporarily fill hole end hole home long time find tranquility calm hole name loneliness easier hide darkness hole dream fantasy perfect go outside imperfections revere like diver whose oxygen tank run would go outside breathe naturally disappoint dig hole isolate extent originally saw dig hole indifference whisper begin mock lonely miserable dig hole incredible fear cause get hole meet expectations laugh even though like think wonder continue dig hole grave
Rohifi,lonely,1620369351.0,Better to put up walls first or welcome all and ghost the awfuls?,"Just something I’ve been thinking about:

If I put up walls to potential friendships upfront, I will only be contacted by/engaged in meaningful conversation with folks I already have real good odds of hitting it off with and feeling safe around; however, this means that most of my posts that are seeking some kind of connection mostly go ignored or invite hateful replies/dms.

Not always, sometimes they do seem to work and I’ll be approached (here on reddit) by a seemingly like-minded, kind-hearted person.

But, fuckin’ hell, the waiting, questioning, and yes loneliness between these rare connections can often be overwhelming!

Conversely, if I were to just chat up every post which even remotely caught my eye (extroverted introvert by social necessity), or made my own posts more generic and crowd-pleasing/baiting, I’d probably experience a lot more basic, first-step hellos but would then have to suss out who each person is at a fundamental, will we even vibe level. And then if we don’t, I have to decide to tell them why and bail or just ghost entirely — in that situation I’d usually tell the reason unless it’s a truly heinous person who’s not even worth the courtesy of the truth.

So which method is better? I guess it depends on what kind of loneliness I’m really looking to ease.

Not sure why I’m posting this other than to just get the thought out, and maybe to see if anyone has thoughts of their own to add.",something ive think put wall potential friendships upfront contact engage meaningful conversation folks already real good odds hit feel safe around however mean post seek kind connection mostly go ignore invite hateful reply dms always sometimes seem work ill approach reddit seemingly like mind kind hearted person fuckin hell wait question yes loneliness rare connections often overwhelm conversely chat every post even remotely catch eye extroverted introvert social necessity make post generic crowd please bait id probably experience lot basic first step hellos would suss person fundamental even vibe level decide tell bail ghost entirely situation id usually tell reason unless truly heinous person whos even worth courtesy truth method better guess depend kind loneliness im really look ease sure im post get think maybe see anyone thoughts add

totalynotathrowavvay,lonely,1620609924.0,Fill the void,"I just want to punch a hole through my chest so that unbearable void would fill in. This void is sucking everything out of me. Nothing's worse then running into ppl that make you feel more alone then you felt before.

&#x200B;

And then there's those that say ""Oh, but before you try to be around others you must first learn to be alone with yourself and to learn to love yourself"". This makes no sense to me, it's like saying ""if you are afraid your house might burn down, just burn it yourself""... defeats the purpose. Been alone for over a decade, had enough of it. Why should I go back and get better at being alone instead of reaching out and meeting ppl in the hopes that 1 day I will run into someone with who I have a mutual positive influence on each other. Why do ppl keep giving this advice? Seen it many times, even got it myself a few. If I've been eating carrot soup every day for 10 years and I finally say I had enough of it and look for other food, would it be not normal to be pissed and frustrated if others tell me ""the problem is not the soup, it's you, you have to learn to enjoy your soup"". Why?!?! the more I kep at it the worse it will get! Well shit, if I enjoyed being alone why would I look for others? And if I didn't, why would I try to force myself to get used to it when it's not the only option? Why force myself to learn to endure something I hate or is causing me pain, on myself, if I don't absolutely have to? It's like being advised to adopt toxic thinking and to some degree, self harm!

I understand I'm quite off the rails and would take ages to actually find someone I get along with and also not feel lonelier while being around. But is this a mirage? As I tend to feel that someone spending time with me, would be better of around other that would be a better influence and better company overall. So eventually the guilt of having a negative impact/wasting someone's life(time) would make it impossible to get along even with someone that would be a theoretical perfect match? But I'm ok with who and what I am and learned to accept it a long time ago, so this should not be an issue, right? Yet it still is... I can learn to ignore it or live with it. It will be there forever though, ain't it? Is this what ppl talk about when they say ""a true friendship is 60%-40% where both try to contribute 60%""?

I feel like I can't even fully be mad because they all have work and other responsibilities but it still makes me sad to spend my birthday alone.  

The only friends I've made and been able to hang out with the past year are actually all my roommates coworkers / friends. My roommate and I used to be best friends but lately I've noticed he doesn't try to spend any time with me or even look up from his phone when I talk to him. Having to rely on him for a friend group makes me feel like a burden and he's even made comments in the past when he feels like I'm getting too close with one of his friends or says things like he should have never introduced me to them. We've been friends since highschool, going on 10 years, but I just don't feel like I have a place in his life anymore but it's so difficult to let go of.

For background we are somewhere in Canada and both of us are immigrants(different home countries) both has history of going through tough times in our individual phases. We became friends about 8 months ago.

We used to talk everyday regular replies were common from both of our sides. Since we had traumatic pasts we usually get mental breakdown from time to time and as good friends usually do we talk each other out whenever needed. Mostly I get such mental issues because I am working at most toxic workplace that wont pay enough and need to work way too much (I do it for permanent residency other immigrants know what I am talking about).

Fast forward to March 1st week, we were talking regularly as usual and I was up all night in the morning she texted me around 4 in the morning (S stands for her, M stands for me) this is where I think everything went wrong but it must be my overthinking I am not sure!

S: hey good morning I am up super early.  
M: well I wasn't able to sleep unfortunately.  
S: you are still up what happened?  
M: try to sleep for sometime I will tell you later in the day, it is too much to sink in at 4 in the morning  
S: ok have a great day  
\*few hours later I text her what was wrong and what lead me to not sleep throughout the night\*

She did not reply for few hours and as she usually tries to calm me down and give the hopes that everything will be alright and so on.

But I noticed that now she was not replying to me as normally as she usually would, sometimes would take hours or even a day or 2. I thought she might be busy and her school exams were up so probably studying for that.

Fast forward around 3 weeks ago, thing were same she would reply late and would just ask me if I can help her with her assignments and what not that I usually help her with.

S: I am kind of feeling low  
M: you want to talk about it? I am always here if you want to vent it out  
\*No replies for a day\*  
M: hey everything ok there? I am worried for you now?  
S: I am feeling ok, my grandma is sick taking care of her  
M: feel free to let me know if I can be of any kind of help? Do you mind keeping me updated?  
\*No replies for 2 days, I thought she is busy and didn't want to be bothered\*  
M: hi, how is everything with you family everyone doing good? Always remember you have a friend that is always worried for you (She sometimes thinks that nobody cares for her)  
\*No reply throughout the day\*  
S: I am good, grandma is good. I am just binge watching on Netflix.  
M: Sounds good, carry on!

Few days past without no texts being exchanged, a night came when I was feeling low

M: I am feeling low  
\*few hours past\*  
S: I am sorry wanna talk? I've been just studying for the tests whole day  
M: sorry I didn't know that, please carry on I shouldn't have bothered you in the first place.  
S: are you mad at me?  
M: no I will not be mad at you like ever, I just want to tell someone that I was upset and your name stroke my head, sorry for disturbing you  
S: are you ready for your work tomorrow?  
M: as if I was good enough for a better job  
\*she liked my message\*  
M: I am sorry, don't be mad at me for this  
\*next day evening\*  
M: sorry for last night, I hope I haven't blown up our friendship  
\*no replies for 2-3 days\*  
S: can you help me with this test?  
M: sure  
\*we did the test and scored good (over 85%)\*  
S: can you help me with another test  
M: sure  
\*after 2-3 questions she did not reply at all and after 3 days and last day of semester\*  
S: almost done with the semester only 1 assignment left, can you help me with this? It is due tonight  
S: omg I just noticed it is due at 9  
\*it was a project and the time was 6\*  
M: no worries we can get it done together  
S: I am failing this course  
M: we can get it done chill  
It was a group project should be done by a group of 2-4 members  
M: It says group members names should be written here, can you give me their names?  
S: I am alone  
\*project was done like 30 minutes before the due time\*  
S: what will I be able to do without you?  
M: I guess we will never find out, I will not let you alone, ever!!

After this she would usually reply once or twice everyday or every second day.

Fast forward to earlier this week (Saturday).

M: do you have few minutes to talk?  
\*after like 4 hours\* (note: from now on all her replies are after the duration of about 20 minutes to 1 hour)  
S: sorry I was talking nap what's up?  
M: does it feel like I am forcing a conversation on you and you just don't want to answer me, did I do something to upset you?  
S: why would you say that?  
M: you don't reply for sometimes days and the other night you left me on seen and throughout the night I was just wondering if you are mad at me and you will probably never talk to me again  
S: I am sorry, I am just binge watching on Netflix, and my notifications are also off.  
\*we had a deep conversation that night with the same late replies duration\*  
(Sunday)  
M: why have you never given up on me?  
(Monday)  
I was at the client location she started working there, and her colleague called me to fix something.  
I was her and said Hi, and did my thing and left  
S: why were you in such a rush  
M: sorry I thought I was done, did you want something?  
S: just wanted to say hi,  
M: I said Hi to you and you never replied! I can come back after my work ends I will be around the corner for some groceries  
S: no that's fine  
M: ok  
S: I know I haven't answered you, I don't know what I want to answer  
M: you don't have to answer/reply if you don't want to. I've been pushy lately it's ok I understand.

Its been a day now and she has not messaged me. I am starting to think the she will never message me now and the friendship is done.

Something to understand from my perspective, I never took more than like 20 minutes to reply, especially when she needed support, help etc. So not that I am re reading some of the texts, I feel a bit insulted that she prioritized Netflix over replying to me.

I do understand that she does not need to talk to me day and night but replying after few days? Especially after talking day and night and discussing about our day? Is it weird only for me?

Now I am just sitting waiting for her text, I do want to just tell her that this was so upsetting for me but I feel like I will be ignored forever.

I am thinking that this is just my overthinking mind saying everything, so here I am trying to cry my heart out to kind reddit strangers. I do like her was planning to ask her if she wants to be more that friends, but before that I have to get a better job which is a bit difficult because 1) Immigrant(yes companies do not accept immigrants as their employees, only those who do are immigrants as well and know that employees will do anything to keep their job) 2) COVID-19

Degenerate_Senpai,lonely,1620192771.0,I never want to fall in love or have crushes ever again [SUPER LONG RANT],"This may seem like a childish statement, but I've experienced just enough to not want to pursue another relationship or ask out another woman again. I may only be 19 years old, and there may be some of you who'll say something along the lines of ""you have your whole life to fall in love"" or whatever, but I don't want to go through the trials and tribulations of such.

I knew a girl back in middle school; let's call her Christina. We started becoming friends after our friend circles started colliding. Best way to describe her: imagine that shy, nerdy, cute girl you secretly had a crush on when you was 12 or 13. That was basically her in a nutshell, so you can imagine how surprised and happy I was when Christina asked me out. I said yes, and we became a couple. Throughout our relationship, though, she was shy to do a lot of things. She was shy to hold hands and hug in front of people. So, when it came to the times Christina kissed me on the cheek, it took a lot of courage for her to do so. As for me, I was patient and told her time and time again we can do intimate things only when she was 100% comfortable with it. (As you'll come to find out, Christina was the type of girl to expect me to do the complete opposite of what I said.) A bit later in our relationship, Christina became distant when it came to talking and being around me. When she wasn't saying anything despite my insistent asking, I had no choice but to turn to my friends. Turns out, they were trying to find a way to tell me: Christina was cheating on me. And, sure enough, she was. And, to put it simply, she was NOT a shy person whatsoever. Christina is the type of girl who wanted to be dominated by a man rather than being with someone who was patient; I didn't fit that persona she wanted me to be, which led to her telling me the reason why she cheated on me was because ""I didn't act like a man."" Also, she was going through developments in her sexuality that made her loose attraction to me, and she thought ignoring me was going to get me to leave her alone. With that being said, I was played from the beginning. Christina asked me out, only to not be honest with me when it came to how she wanted to be treated or being open about the changes in her sexuality, but rather, chose to cheat on me despite her initiating our relationship.

Something similar happened with another girl I dated during my sophomore year of high school; let's call her May. May and I have known one another since the summer before our freshman year, and became friends within our friend circle. May experienced a rough breakup during our freshman year when her ex cheated on her. So, cut to our sophomore year, May got ahold of my phone number and asked me out. She was another girl who I secretly had a crush on, and she's been having a crush on me for about a year or so, so I said yes. We were both busy in our lives, so it took a lot of energy from both of us to be with one another. Until, she broke up with me through text out of the blue. And, she went back to her ex, only to break up with him again when he cheated again. Basically, May asking me out was based on a quick impulse, based on the small crush she's had on me for so long. And, our relationship was nothing but a void to fill while May was still healing from a breakup, only to go back to the guy who already established himself as not loyal. My time was wasted yet again in maintaining another relationship that would mean absolutely nothing. 

You may notice that these relationships only began because I was being asked out, and not the other way around. I have asked out women in the past, only to be rejected every time I did. I never had a problem with being rejected or anything. It's okay when a girl doesn't like me, but the last time I asked out a girl is somewhat scarring to me based on the end result. I was friends with another girl back in high school, let's call her April, and we've been knowing one another since the eighth grade. So, we've known one another for a while. There was one point in our friendship where April and I were very close, and our friends saw something in us. (They never told her this, as far as my knowledge grants me. It was something they verbalized to me a lot at the time.) I wanted to ask April out, and it seemed like my friends read my mind when they were encouraging me to do so. So, I did. Only to be rejected. I'm okay with the rejection, except, she ghosted me from that moment on. It seemed like the close friendship we've had for years at that point just disappeared. She would always run away from me whenever we spotted one another in the hallway and among our friend circle. She would turn her head suddenly when we happened to meet eyes with one another in the hallway or if we were grouped in an activity together. Her silent treatment worked up until our graduation. During our silence, April dated an older guy who was long graduated by the time we graduated. From what I've heard, April was cheated on a handful of times when her boyfriend started seeing older women behind her back, and a lot of conflicts rose within her friendships because of her relationship. That aside, I never received any closure as to why she treated me asking her out as such a bad, taboo thing. Or, what she saw in the guy she would eventually date in comparison to me. So, I only have my interpretations as to why someone would react so strongly to that, and to be with someone else so problematic for so long. It made me look at myself in a bad light:

""Two relationships failed. First girl cheated on me. Second girl used me until she wanted to go back to her cheating ex. Now, I done ruined a long lasting friendship. What's wrong with me? Am I that disgusting to women that I can be mistreated and ignored so badly? Do girls see me as that disgusting and meaningless to either cheat on me or be with someone else who will inevitably end up hurting them? Time and time again even! Meanwhile, I'm over here playing love guru to all my girl-friends (""friends who are girls"") who already have boyfriends. Why do people see my opinions in such a way to where I'm the only person to talk to about relationships? It would make people think that I too am deserving of experiencing at least one good relationship, shouldn't it? Or, to come across one girl who'll treat me right? But no. I should've known better. After how many rejections I had. After how many times girls I didn't even know called me ugly. I should no better than to believe I'm worthy of being in a good relationship, or finding a girl who truly reciprocates the same feelings as I. Having passions and goals in life - hell, not cheating on people - means nothing when girls always call you ugly and whatnot.""

To this day, I haven't asked out another woman again. There was one point, however, where it seemed like I was close to breaking my rule when I met a transfer student during my senior year. She quickly found a boyfriend. Nothing wrong with that, except, I had to play love-guru again to another one of my girl-friends who was having boyfriend issues. Call me petty, but is that all girls see me as? Someone not boyfriend material, but smart enough to at least having relationship advice? It seems contradicting. I'm at a point to where I don't even wanna go through the possibility of going through the same hurt and self-loathing all over again. It's not like things are gonna get easier just because I'm in college. It's hard to find loyalty in my generation. With the amount of toxic feminist mindsets that women are influenced by, and the physical standards men are now expected to have in order to be considered dateable. No matter how often I try to keep up with my appearance or keep myself busy with my education and planning out the ongoing development of my entrepreneurship, those generational obstacles are not going away. Unless, I hardwire myself to become one of those cheating guys those girls end up falling in love with. It's not worth the personality change. It's not worth the energy of making yourself appear a certain way towards women. It's not worth going through the hurt. I do want to be in a relationship, though, don't get me wrong. I find myself shamelessly listening to girlfriend ASMR videos through my headphones while I hug a pillow to sleep. But, as I've said many times before, it's not worth it.",may seem like childish statement experience enough want pursue another relationship ask another woman may nmbr years old may say something along line whole life fall love whatever want go trials tribulations know girl back middle school let call christina start become friends friend circle start collide best way describe imagine shy nerdy cute girl secretly crush nmbr 13 basically nutshell imagine surprise happy christina ask say yes become couple throughout relationship though shy lot things shy hold hand hug front people come time christina kiss cheek take lot courage patient tell time time intimate things 100 comfortable come find christina type girl expect complete opposite say bite later relationship christina become distant come talk around say anything despite insistent ask choice turn friends turn try find way tell christina cheat sure enough put simply shy person whatsoever christina type girl want dominate man rather someone patient fit persona want lead tell reason cheat act like man also go developments sexuality make loose attraction think ignore go get leave alone say play begin christina ask honest come want treat open change sexuality rather choose cheat despite initiate relationship something similar happen another girl date sophomore year high school let call may may know one another since summer freshman year become friends within friend circle may experience rough breakup freshman year ex cheat cut sophomore year may get ahold phone number ask another girl secretly crush crush year say yes busy live take lot energy us one another break text blue go back ex break cheat basically may ask base quick impulse base small crush long relationship nothing void fill may still heal breakup go back guy already establish loyal time waste yet maintain another relationship would mean absolutely nothing may notice relationships begin ask way around ask women past reject every time never problem reject anything okay girl like last time ask girl somewhat scar base end result friends another girl back high school let call april know one another since eighth grade know one another one point friendship april close friends saw something us never tell far knowledge grant something verbalize lot time want ask april seem like friends read mind encourage reject okay rejection except ghost moment seem like close friendship years point disappear would always run away whenever spot one another hallway among friend circle would turn head suddenly happen meet eye one another hallway group activity together silent treatment work graduation silence april date older guy long graduate time graduate hear april cheat handful time boyfriend start see older women behind back lot conflict rise within friendships relationship aside never receive closure treat ask bad taboo thing saw guy would eventually date comparison interpretations someone would react strongly someone else problematic long make look bad light two relationships fail first girl cheat second girl use want go back cheat ex ruin long last friendship wrong disgust women mistreat ignore badly girls see disgust meaningless either cheat someone else inevitably end hurt time time even meanwhile play love guru girl friends friends girls already boyfriends people see opinions way person talk relationships would make people think deserve experience least one good relationship come across one girl treat right know better many rejections many time girls even know call ugly better believe worthy good relationship find girl truly reciprocate feel passions goals life hell cheat people mean nothing girls always call ugly whatnot day ask another woman one point however seem like close break rule meet transfer student senior year quickly find boyfriend nothing wrong except play love guru another one girl friends boyfriend issue call petty girls see someone boyfriend material smart enough least relationship advice seem contradict point even wan na go possibility go hurt self loathe like things gon na get easier college hard find loyalty generation amount toxic feminist mindsets women influence physical standards men expect order consider dateable matter often try keep appearance keep busy education plan ongoing development entrepreneurship generational obstacles go away unless hardwire become one cheat guy girls end fall love worth personality change worth energy make appear certain way towards women worth go hurt want relationship though get wrong find shamelessly listen girlfriend asmr videos headphones hug pillow sleep say many time worth

123blueskies,lonely,1620593948.0,"Perpetual Uncertainty, deep down the loneliness burden.","Perpetual uncertainty, that's the name of the game.

 In recent days there has been a feeling of emptiness, but today it is already helplessness.
 I feel like I have lost the love and important feelings, and in general the superficiality around me kills me, and eats me from within.

 They are all pecked, addicted and fast.  And next to them I cry inside me and think ""until when"".  It is difficult to be next to them, to be aware of reality.  To be lonely.

 Being alone is nice, but sometimes life limits me.  My family is like a dying person who has long since lost consciousness, and I feel like a soul that wants to escape.
 It is difficult.  I am in uncertainty, want to escape, want peace.  But the factory draws me to it every day anew, and I sink into emptiness and destroy the personality within me.  It hurts me in development and it is harmful.

 And talking to her, it's a fear of talking that will become a burden.  The superficiality will make me lose humanity.  And I'll hurt.  Humanity is a thought, but it leads to reality.
 And I must hold on to it with all my might.  And meanwhile I feel pretty lonely.  Not because there is no one by my side, but because my thoughts are so different from the emptiness that surrounds me.  And if anyone could understand me, it would be a miracle.  It's so much confusion.

DMonstrative,lonely,1620317642.0,Interpreting and Playing the Social Chess Game In Good Faith,"I could make this post trudge endlessly with uninterestingly self loathing or depriving anecdote/introspection, but that wouldn't be helpful. I don't have the complete picture to analyze my shortcomings because we all possess blinders, but I do have the best picture of anyone out there. After all, who knows us better than we know ourselves?

If I can shorten the point of this to my pursuit it would be the following:

Knowing full well that personal relationships require give and take in regards to effort and expressing interest and investment, I feel like any fair definition of friendship doesn't actually apply to any of my relationships at all. Some people call themselves my friends, and for certain periods of time I experience tiny group interactions a few times a year, but I don't know how to properly calculate the process of showing apathy v. overbearingness to maintain these friendships if they are indeed genuine. Where is the sweet spot? Or am I just really that boring and socially undesirable? Is it fixable?

To try to counter a holistically negative description for a bit, I have improved a lot as a person. I'm more responsible and confident than ever. I lost the 130 lbs I needed to lose from high school to have a healthy body and I'm pursuing a career to be a high school math teacher after being in professional doldrums for quite a few years. I have a lot of common interests with people and I've been told I'm personable and genuine, etc. A lot of those qualities are just a basis for everyone, though and don't stand on their own to be a desirable friend.....

The act of writing this even robs me of sympathy for myself, so rest assured that's not what I'm seeking. I would rather further my heuristic and sense making to navigating relationships in every environment because I want to be happy. Everyone ""says"" that, but i want to genuinely be happy and have meaningful relationships outside of just my birth family. Ultimately I want a family of my own, but that level of relationship is even further off so I'm trying to work my way towards being desirable in a less serious context first (I think).

The tl;dr version: I suck with people as evidenced by my loneliness and others' actions if not given to me by advice or truth telling by others. 

Question: What do you do to better yourself? How do you let go of inauthenticity and be comfortable in your own skin? How do you make the most of your life?",could make post trudge endlessly uninterestingly self loathe deprive anecdote introspection helpful complete picture analyze shortcomings possess blinders best picture anyone know us better know shorten point pursuit would follow know full well personal relationships require give take regard effort express interest investment feel like fair definition friendship actually apply relationships people call friends certain periods time experience tiny group interactions time year know properly calculate process show apathy v overbearingness maintain friendships indeed genuine sweet spot really bore socially undesirable fixable try counter holistically negative description bite improve lot person responsible confident ever lose nmbr lbs need lose high school healthy body pursue career high school math teacher professional doldrums quite years lot common interest people tell personable genuine etc lot qualities basis everyone though stand desirable friend act write even rob sympathy rest assure seek would rather heuristic sense make navigate relationships every environment want happy everyone say want genuinely happy meaningful relationships outside birth family ultimately want family level relationship even try work way towards desirable less serious context first think tl dr version suck people evidence loneliness others action give advice truth tell others question better let go inauthenticity comfortable skin make life
SmartRecognition7158,lonely,1620102530.0,I have no one to talk to. My thoughts are starting to take over and I’m scared I might go insane,"I’ve never had anyone to talk to. I’ve always kept my thoughts in my head and it’s consuming me

I’ve always been alone, wanting more, wanting people in my life who want/care about me instead of being awkward around me

These past few months have been rough for me. So many people have told me nasty things and have whittled my self confidence down to absolutely nothing. And the icing on the cake is my girlfriends family telling me I’m a dumpy boyfriend and a bunch of other things.

My girlfriend doesn’t really listen because she never knows what to say. My best and only friend just doesn’t seem to care. And everyone else just gives me one word responses to my ranting

It hurts because people have ranted to me and I’ll ALWAYS listen

My parents either try to start an argument because I’m “wrong and young” or they try to give me life lessons instead of actually trying to listen or give me proper advice. They see me laying there all depressed and keep going on their business

Time and time again I’ve been told “I’m being dramatic” and I “think too much” but that’s all I have is my thoughts, I don’t have an outlet.

I’m too anti social for therapy I’ve tried multiple times but I can’t open up to strangers face to face. I’m so done with trying to express thoughts only to get shut down. I’m so done with everything

I know I know “I’m dramatic, I’m an adult, this is life, I’ve got to look out for myself” I’ve heard it all before. Just once I want to hear “you matter to me” or “I appreciate you coming to me to talk” I just want to feel welcomed in people’s life’s

I could barely piece together this post because I’ve got so many negative thoughts flooding my brain that need out and that’s my problem and why I scare people away. So sorry this post has been all over the place😬

Catzillachan,lonely,1620601043.0,People you don't talk to for years and then contact you only to sell you something,"So today this girl who used to be my classmate sent me an invite to a facebook group. At first I was naive and wondering if she was putting together a reunion or something. We had mutual friends and would hang out in the same group sometimes. Then I thought ""wait no it's probably just a pyramide scheme or one of those 'invite 25 friends and win a prize' scams"". Sure enough, it was a group to sell and promote some soap she was producing. I declined the invitation. And it's probably petty of me, but I also unfriended her. This girl, I had to comfort her when her boyfriend danced with another girl at prom. I was by her side when her friends ditched her at sumner camp (they ditched me too, btw). Once she had a party where she invited everyone in our friend group and only included me because the teacher asked her to invite me. Another time we were going swimming with a couple of friends and she made a comment about my outfit that made me feel uncomfortable and insecure. I don't feel like I owe her anything.

blblblblbll,lonely,1619923968.0,I feel like I am hitting a low point right now,"I made so much progress on self improvement and figuring out what has been wrong in my life. I felt so tired after spending a day typing it out on a document. I wish someone was there to give me a hug. It was hard to process. But my friend who I have been staying with was busy with chatting with someone else. I had no one to talk to. I tried looking for people on the internet to make friends. I am not very enthusiastic about this usually, because I often not feel ready to reach out and make new connections. This time, I wasn’t able to find people to talk to and it didn’t go well because the conversation didn’t last long. I ended up going to omegle and somehow got jnto sexual topic with this guy. We exchanged nudes. It was nice to finally vibe with someone but not in this way. Makes me sad because that wasn’t what I was after. I was just lonely, specifically today. I felt vulnerable, but had the willpower to reach out only to set up a trap for myself to fall into. I am not going to shame myself too much because I want to stay positive to my sexuality. But it feels so meaningless to me to share intimacy with strangers over the internet. People you have no intention to meet. I want to spend time with people in real life and have meaningful connections. Not necessarily sexual. But for my sexual connections, I want them to be meaningful as well. I recognize what I just did was of self-destructive character. Keeping this going isn’t sustainable for me. Which is funny because what I learned from writing all those stuff to myself earlier in the day, was I wanted to stick to a sustainable way of living. A sustainable lifestyle. To not engage in self-destructive behavior. To recognize what is bad and refrain myself from doing those things. To not get involved with people who are toxic. Because I truly believe that is going to make me change into the better version of myself. I made a wrong step and I will never look back. I believe in improvement for myself from tomorrow onwards. I have to make this change for myself. There is no going back now. I know what I want and I want to stay true to myself. It will be tough because loneliness can hit me any time when I’m on my own journey by myself.

I found someone 2 months ago, on Tinder, no less. It was a mistake, we shouldn't have matched. He wasn't even in my city, he'd moved out a week prior. Some sort of app glitch had caused his profile to come through to me. He was cute, he looked sober. Nothing fancy, there wasn't anything that drew me to him in particular. He had this photo in one of the slides of this fat man holding a huge container of something red. He looked familiar, someone I'd seen on tv? Either way, I swiped right to ask him who that character with the funny face holding a large container of red paste(?) was.


We matched, and when I asked him, he told me that was a guy from The Office, and instant dread passed through my mind. I judge people who like The Office and talk about it like a personality trait. We shouldn't have matched. I'd have never swiped right on him had I know it was a The Office reference. He said the guy in the shot spills tomato soup he worked really hard for and he could just relate to that. A little bit of small talk, and we started really bouncing off each other. I LOVED talking to him. We texted for hours, and the next day I didn't know if we were going to talk again. He texted the next night though, and we started scheduling Discord calls where we'd just watch YouTube videos together, and then movies and then listening to songs together.


Well it's been two months since we started talking, and we end every conversation with ""I love you"". If I'm being honest, I don't know how real this is, but having someone to say I love them is a privilege I will never take for granted.

Legataux,lonely,1620084668.0,I am truely alone,"I tried connecting with a couple of people I knew years ago. That spark of connectivity is gone. There was no back and forth. It was just me asking questions and being a little nostalgic. 

I know getting a random message from a person you haven't seen for years doesn't illicit the desire to spill everything, but it would have been nice if they asked me questions. The flow of the conversations were so one sided. If I was on the receiving end I would be thrilled that someone from my life remembered me and wanted to reconnect.

I know online messaging is impersonal, but in the past that's how I communicated with my circle of friends. We game, go online, and say hello to each other. We'd message each other for hours until it was time to sleep and we'd say our goodbyes until next time. I felt that connection then. It's gone now. It hurts knowing that I'm basically a ghost. I'm just a distant memory. I have no friends anymore. I'm empty. 

It's like that feeling of being the only one left. That feeling of watching an empty world. Have you guys seen your friends list on an online game and everyone is offline? 

I play online games because there I forget that I'm alone. I get to say hi to people, even though it's more or less one time interactions. It distracts me from my reality, at least for a little bit. It helps me regain some of that feeling I had, where I was part of a community and I can regularly say hello.

Sometimes I just want to lay on my bed and sleep. I have a loving family, but we aren't friends. There's no dynamic back and forth. I know there's love between them and me, but friends are friends for a reason. My family doesn't socially satisfy me that friends do. I'm so starved for socialization that I remember every bit and piece of it because I seldom get any.

velius_the_devil,lonely,1619926478.0,Isolated,"The events of this past year have left me incredibly isolated, frustrated, and lonely.

Sorry, it's kind of a long story but I'll try to give a condensed version...

About a year ago I had a modest group of friends and a partner. I had recently become pretty sick so I was already stuck at home before quarantine became a thing due to covid. It didn't take too long for me to realize my partner felt more inconvenienced by my sickness than concerned or supportive. Despite knowing this I desperately tried to keep them around because my condition was getting worse and I wanted their support. Eventually they came up with a pretty lame excuse to end things and we went our separate ways. Most of our mutual friends have since stopped talking to me.

I then became completely fixated on my sickness. Constant online research, visits to the doctor, tests, procedures... No diagnosis. After losing \~45 lbs (didn't have a lot of extra weight to lose) and at the absolute end of my rope, a specialist prescribed a medication on a whim, a total guess. It helped for a while, to the point where I thought I had won my health back, but then I became really sick again. I've since gone through 2 more rounds of the medication, with a month or two of feeling healthy in between.

I was feeling REALLY good for a couple months. I had started exercising and working out, even gained back some weight. Then, even though I've been SUPER careful, I got covid. I had some of the typical symptoms like loss of taste/smell, trouble breathing, chest congestion/pain, etc., but it also seemed to bring back all of my old issues and symptoms all at once. This particular ordeal lasted for around 3 weeks, and my ""old"" symptoms thankfully started to fade just as the covid symptoms did. A miserable experience for sure, but I'm thankful it only lasted as long as it did.

Now I'm ""better"" again, though my symptoms aren't totally absent. I've since been able to start running and working out again and it feels good to see the progress I'm making. But now that I've spent so much time literally fighting for my life and putting so much time and effort into my personal health I've found myself totally isolated. I work from home, I exercise at home, I cook and eat my meals at home. It's like now that I have some room to breathe, some time to spend doing anything other than focusing on my health, I'm able to take a look around for the first time in a year and I don't see any of my friends. I've reached out to some of them, but for the most part it seems like the connection is dead.

In a weird, messed up way I kind of miss being sick (yes, I am in therapy lol). It gave me something to focus my whole self on, a purpose. Now that I can get back to other aspects of my life I'm kind of reeling at the amount of loss, and how lonely, I feel.",events past year leave incredibly isolate frustrate lonely sorry kind long story try give condense version year ago modest group friends partner recently become pretty sick already stick home quarantine become thing due covid take long realize partner felt inconvenience sickness concern supportive despite know desperately try keep around condition get worse want support eventually come pretty lame excuse end things go separate ways mutual friends since stop talk become completely fixate sickness constant online research visit doctor test procedures diagnosis lose 45 lbs lot extra weight lose absolute end rope specialist prescribe medication whim total guess help point think win health back become really sick since go nmbr round medication month two feel healthy feel really good couple months start exercise work even gain back weight even though super careful get covid typical symptoms like loss taste smell trouble breathe chest congestion pain etc also seem bring back old issue symptoms particular ordeal last around nmbr weeks old symptoms thankfully start fade covid symptoms miserable experience sure thankful last long better though symptoms totally absent since able start run work feel good see progress make spend much time literally fight life put much time effort personal health find totally isolate work home exercise home cook eat meals home like room breathe time spend anything focus health able take look around first time year see friends reach part seem like connection dead weird mess way kind miss sick yes therapy lol give something focus whole self purpose get back aspects life kind reel amount loss lonely feel

I spend the weekends laying in bed wondering how can I save myself from this loneliness. how can I make ppl like me. most of the time I come to the conclusion that I have to become rich somehow ... that's the only thing I can control.

I know I'm not attractive or funny, I get it ... I probably wouldn't date myself too.

slong35,lonely,1620142773.0,Wanted to get this off my chest.,"Sorry for a long post but I need to get some things off my chest so I figured that sending it out there might do some good. I already posted this on the therapy subreddit but literally nobody saw it. I don’t want a pity party or lots of attention but I at least wanted to share a few things with people and see what they think. 

I’m 26 and have been diagnosed with chemical depression but I’m pretty convinced I also have some anxiety issues as well (based on a few other family members that obviously struggle with it but are too proud to go see a doctor for it.) I take medication but it doesn’t really help all that much. I regularly exercise and have taken therapy before but neither one has been any sort of relief toward the issue.

So I’ll list a few of the problems that I’ve been dealing with (even though there’s much more to them than what I’ll put in here.) I’ve wanted my life to be much more of an adventure but I feel held back from the things I want to accomplish. Not just from my family but also by myself. I don’t have much respect for who I am, what I look like, how shy I tend to be, and all the things I’ve spent years on to try and build in my life (music, drawing, learning languages, etc.) I’ve always wanted to live and work in Japan. I went there for a study abroad program back in 2017 and I fell in love with the people, culture, and rich history there. I also felt strangely at home because many of the world views and mannerisms I experienced over there were very similar to how I feel and look at the world. Anyway, I want to go there and start with a teaching job but I don’t feel worth the trouble. It’s either I go there and leave my family, or stay here and be miserable. Kind of a “lose-lose” scenario from how it feels.

I’ve never been good with dating but I crave the feeling of being loved by someone. I also want to be a dad more than anything in the world because I feel like there’s so much love that I have to give. It’s just excruciating to have that kind of a desire but never being able to achieve that. The only relationship I’ve ever been in finally had me thinking I was getting close but I couldn’t help but think that she was only with me because she couldn’t find anyone else that would marry her and I was simply her version of ‘settling’. I really feel like I did love her but I had never actually been in a real relationship so I didn’t know what to do. Long story short I ended up breaking things off with her. I still think about her a lot but she’s married and has a kid already so I feel like I missed out on a real shot at happiness.

There’s much more than these two examples but the gist is that I feel like human garbage and not worth anyone’s time. This stuff has been on my mind a lot (especially in the last few days) and I wanted to put this out there and see what people might think (from an outside perspective I suppose.)",sorry long post need get things chest figure send might good already post therapy subreddit literally nobody saw want pity party lot attention least want share things people see think im nmbr diagnose chemical depression im pretty convince also anxiety issue well base family members obviously struggle proud go see doctor take medication really help much regularly exercise take therapy neither one sort relief toward issue ill list problems ive deal even though theres much ill put ive want life much adventure feel hold back things want accomplish family also much respect look like shy tend things ive spend years try build life music draw learn languages etc ive always want live work japan go study abroad program back nmbr fell love people culture rich history also felt strangely home many world view mannerisms experience similar feel look world anyway want go start teach job feel worth trouble either go leave family stay miserable kind lose lose scenario feel ive never good date crave feel love someone also want dad anything world feel like theres much love give excruciate kind desire never able achieve relationship ive ever finally think get close help think find anyone else would marry simply version settle really feel like love never actually real relationship know long story short end break things still think lot marry kid already feel like miss real shoot happiness theres much two examples gist feel like human garbage worth anyones time stuff mind lot especially last days want put see people might think outside perspective suppose

It's very stupid, but I hoped I'd finally become a ""late bloomer"" of sorts. Well, I didn't. I decided to drop out, but at the time my drinking was already nearly daily and only getting worse. 

Since then my drinking has lead to arrests, stays in the hospital/mental ward, one rehab and various other bullshit. A lot of seems so bad that it should scare me away from drinking, but honestly, whenever it gets late and I look around in my silent, empty apartment I just can't resist the urge to drink. I feel I can't cope with being alone without drinking. I tried approaching people before, but the friendships I have with them are always extremely one sided and they never talk to me on their own.

As I start going to my uni lectures I realise its so much harder to meet people since I'm not having the situations of staying in an accommodation and living with new people. When I meet course mates we can't really do anything after uni sessions when it takes me such a long time to get home, with staying at home came me needing to get a 40 minute train and for me to drive from the station to the little village I live in, so any sense of drinking alcohol can't happen (not that I enjoy alcohol, it makes my anxiety so bad)

I regret so much not living in the city where my university is located, I can't do societies, I just feel like I'm not growing.

Recently I had to quit this job I had just got at a petrol station due to my mental health , it made me feel so much more lonier since I now don't get any real interaction with people outside of my house. I don't really have friends and I just live with my mum.

madmaxvhd1,lonely,1620015007.0,It is one of those nights.,"Yeah- One of those nights. I suppose I'm referring to nights that have some kind of feeling about them- It's hard to explain. I would describe this feeling as a combination of awe, melancholy, calmness and peacefulness. I'm not the best at describing it- but I believe you already understand what I mean. This feeling is only peculiar to these nights and I guess I wanted to talk about it.

I feel lonely all the time- On these nights though, I either notice it less or it simply doesn't bother me. These are perhaps my favorite times of life, the peacefulness I feel is something I wish was with me all the time.

Sometimes, I wish I could just observe the world. I don't want to have to worry about life. I just want to see the trees blowing in the wind and the sun setting. Why can't everything just be peaceful? ""I can't wait to grow up"" I used to tell myself.. ""I want to be young again"" I now tell myself.. Oh how things change.. I guess everything changes.

Do you ever just reach a point in your sadness, where you feel at peace? like nothing can hurt you more than you’ve already felt, it can’t get worse, so it has to get better, right? I'm just so tried of being alone.

Yeah. I just wanted to say that I guess- No real point behind this post I suppose, It's just one of those nights.",yeah one nights suppose refer nights kind feel hard explain would describe feel combination awe melancholy calmness peacefulness best describe believe already understand mean feel peculiar nights guess want talk feel lonely time nights though either notice less simply bother perhaps favorite time life peacefulness feel something wish time sometimes wish could observe world want worry life want see tree blow wind sun set everything peaceful wait grow use tell want young tell oh things change guess everything change ever reach point sadness feel peace like nothing hurt already felt cant get worse get better right try alone yeah want say guess real point behind post suppose one nights

I had online classes and couldn't force myself to go to discussions because I'm kinda pathetic and my grades are tanking. I have nothing I'm interested in doing long term, there are things Id like to change in the world but I have so little power to change things. I live with family but I feel no love even though they probably love me. I just wonder how it came to this, but it makes sense.

happyaquarius,lonely,1620463003.0,Extreme Loneliness,"Hi everyone! Isn’t it crazy how loneliness is a disadvantage? Good social skills don’t come from being by yourself all the time. Since I was a kid I’ve been very isolated so I was learning social skills a little late and I still am so bad at it, I cringe at myself all the time...I don’t have any family or friends and it’s just me taking care of my two girls. I go to work but really the interaction is not much connection and sometimes people want to talk to me more intimately but I’m only looking for friends so I shut them out. I also struggle making connections because I struggle with well, loneliness and anxiety. The loneliness causes me to talk too much and anxiety makes me wish I’d just shut up. I love my girls but I wish I had someone to have more adult conversations with. Also it really puts me down that I’m raising two girls who have a mom like me. If any moms see this and can relate I love and appreciate you and I send you an abundance of energy. On the bright side my girls are literally keeping me sane. 
I will say whatever you’re interested in I encourage you to find ways to integrate yourself into your hobbies. Ex.

_JosephiKrakowski,lonely,1620338800.0,Nothing is more isolating than seeing other people's happiness.,"Ok so before anyone jumps to conclusions, lemme explain myself.

What I mean is that I see on a daily basis other people (friends mainly) being in relationships or holding hands with people or anything like that. As someone who has never been in a relationship, this hurts. Now obviously I'm happy for them because of course I am but it's still a thought I can't ignore.

I'm rarely truly happy these days. I beat myself down and convince myself I'm no good. I don't feel like I have any skills or talents. I can make people laugh easily but I don't think I'm funny. I'm not smart. Hell, I'm not even attractive in any way. And seeing other people in the complete opposite position to me makes me feel like a spectator to all the good things in their life while having none of my own.

I'm lonely. I have loads of friends but I still feel isolated. Who even am I? I used to talk to people regularly but now I take much longer to text back. I don't know what's wrong with me.

I've gotten a bit off-topic, the gist of this is that everyone else can hitch up but I can't. Even one of my friends who pretty much everyone (especially girls) finds annoying and yet he's got a girlfriend. Why am I so repulsive? Why can't I get it right? Am I really just that worthless?

crinders,lonely,1620583259.0,Getting over losing all of my friends,"
It's been over 4 years now since I've lost my friend group that I've been so close with ( we hung out every day and done everything together). It's still very painful and I'm still scared and get anxiety to face them. 

We were right before graduating when shit hit the fan. My best friend was in love with this girl and so was I but I actually had no idea. Long story short he got messed up in the head cuz of this girl who was also part of our group and clearly who he was madly in love with. They got together one or two times and she took his virginity. However she ended it but she remained in the friend group. 

One day when I was wasted I've got with her. The next day I felt so bad about it since my best friend was madly in love with her. However it was sooo good, probably even better since it was forbidden. We kept getting together behind everyone's back for a couple of months. Until one day when we were drunk he found out. I apologised but he wouldn't listen, I even told him to punch me but he wouldn't. I was so sad, upset and ashamed that I've done it and could barely live with my self. 

In the next 2 weeks I still kept seeing her and he knew about it. Then one night he wanted to meet up to talk so we did. However he just beat the living crap out of me. He left and my mom found me almost unconscious. She brought me to the hospital, but I was fine just a few bumps and scratches nothing serious. 

In my opinion the whole thing was fine now, I got with the girl he loved and therefore he beat me up. I would have done the same if I was in his position. I kept seeing her because at it turned out I loved her as well and finally I was happy! Most of my friends stopped talking to me however  some still talked to me and understood. 

3 days later I came back home to find my mom, sisters and dad waiting for me. They sat me down and tried talking me into going to the police to report him. I stood my ground and told them no way in hell I will do that as I knew how bad things are gonna turn. However they kept trying and trying until finally I gave in. I then went on to report him for which I to this day hate myself for. Since I don't believe what he's done was wrong and also having to report my best friend is just horrible. 

Obviously it completely backfired and all of my mates turned on me, I mean who wouldn't. I even had more of my mates threaten me to beat me up as well for going to the cops. As I live in a small town this story spread rapidly and I was even more ashamed. I developed anxiety for doing the simplest things such as going to the gym, grocery store, gas station, even getting pizza delivered cuz that person might know and spit in my pizza. (Thats messed up ain't it?)

 I've started travelling and moved away but to this day when I'm back visiting my family I still can't go fill up my gas without feeling anxiety and fear. I can't evengo grocery shopping without being scared. Usually I avoid any places where I could possibly meet my old mates or class mates or even anyone who's in my age group. It's a horrible feeling and it destroys me. I need to get rid of that anxiety and fear but I don't know how. 

By now I hate my family for basically forcing me to report this to the police. If they hadn't done that my life would be a lot nicer now. They forced me and then left me to deal with it. I can't understand how that is fair. Any time I try to talk to my mom about it she jtst says: ""you have to report this because it's wrong. If you like it or not"". She just doesn't understand what impact this had on me and my life. And how much anxiety and fear this has given me. Even while I seemed happy for being with my girl I was still deeply depressed inside. Losing my best friend has been the hardest thing in my life.

To this day I've never spoken to my former best friend and anyone else out of this friend group. Its still very hard for me to make new friends and even be happy. I also keep thinking back to this time in my life and still feel the shame, anxiety and fear. 

I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read my story.

ri7su7ka,lonely,1620627284.0,Writing personal essay for last assignment makes me want to rip out my fucking hair,"I'm a senior in high school, about to graduate (hopefully, I'm about on the edge of failing my necessary class right now..) but holy shit the last roadblock is an essay about my experiences and 'Ten Things I know to be true.' Everything I think of for this is all trauma, the isolation, depression, ideation, just.... a lot of negative things 'I know.' I read the examples and it's just about funny things, encouraging words, actual life experiences... being alive. I dont know those things at all... I am already horrendous at my work (honestly lazy... didn't think I would make this far and... honestly don't care if I do graduate, i never did.) But having to make it personal is just even more shit. The last personal essay I had to write in this fucking class was about me trying to so neatly and clinically compare how my own mom's death felt compared to the book we were reading and I almost failed that too, really because it was late but....I just feel so weak.

LL_Pegasi,lonely,1620131997.0,Missing my parents immensely,"Oftentimes I cry because I miss them so badly. Growing up, they are both far away to work abroad and in a few months I'm turning 18. They are rarely here to visit and stay either for a month/ a year and over the times our relationship has gotten awkward especially with my dad, but with mom it's just alright.

But we talk on the internet, not just often. My grandma and uncle are here to supervise us but we've had history of rocky patches - we used to be so close but not anymore. Barely spoke here in the household for years. 

And so everyday the loneliness and the longing caves in so much that I find solace in things that aren't supposed to be helpful to me. Seeing other children close to their parents, being hugged, comforted or even just having fun with them makes me envious and make my heart churn.

It's pathetic to feel this way, knowing I should be thankful instead for parents that strive hard for my education. So hiding it is the best way. I just open up here.

Void_Skeleton,lonely,1620439615.0,Just another day of Loneliness (Rant/Vent),"(I apologize for any spelling mistakes, English ain't my first language)  
Here I am again, with the same ol' day everyday, having no one to talk to, having no one in my life, not fitting with anyone, let me tell ya, it's quite bullshit when you want to just hangout with someone and realize you have NO ONE in your whole life, it's especially bad when you grow up with autism meaning I already developed anxiety and depression and even worse communication skills which was never treated, let me tell ya, the combination is quite bad when you slap in 'loneliness' into the mix, nowadays I feel almost nothing, I honestly think I am destined to be alone because no matter how hard I try or tried to make friends, I really don't care for relationships even if I never had it in my life, I just want SOMEONE to hangout that I could call them my 'bestfriend' who you could 100% relate to and talk with almost everyday or a group of friends that have the same dedication or interests as me, but I'm just ignored or hated on or just shit talked on for just saying at least one sentence when I try to fit in or chat, it's just asinine that the Universe just puts a 'Lonely no matter what' tag on my life, nowadays all I do is wake up, go to my PC, sit all day in front of it and then go sleep, I mean, I play video games and draw sometimes but it gets real sad when I play a game which I had fun or was interested in and I would have no one to talk to about it, or when I draw I just don't get enough inspiration and only friends (if I had any) would fuel me inspiration.  
I always imagined myself having a bestfriend or being in a group when I watch those Youtube videos, ya know those Youtube videos when you see partners or group of buddies having a lot of fun no matter what the activity is, be it games or just generally hanging out, then realized I have no one, now knowing the fact I'm already a young adult (I'm 21 now) makes me think that I'll never be able to get anyone in my life.

My life has been so uneventful for so long that I don't think I'll be ever be interesting to anyone, I'm just a walking husk and nowadays I'm an asshole to people for no reason, it's hard to be at least bit nice to anyone when I was treated shit all my life just because I was ""DIFFERENT"", autism be damned man.

I don't know if I should call it the worst or the best thing in my life but when I dream I sometimes dream of having people in my life, be it friends or a relationship and the feeling was great and amazing but when I wake up I have a moment of wanting to talk about it to my friends... Oh yeah, I don't have any... That's the worst part. So yeah, I still don't know if that's the best or the worst thing.

Actually, I think the worst part is when you psych up yourself for no reason at all, I just sometimes get that feeling, it's quite annoying when I know there's just nothing to be psyched up for.

I forgot to also mention that I am invisible as fuck, like, I accidentally scare people sometimes, I'm apparently that quiet and invisible, of course you may be thinking that's probably useful in a way, I agree with that but it's very painful at the same time, it's like one of those moments when you try to fit in a conversation in the past in school but you get unnoticed or cut off by everyone else and you just stand there not acknowledged in any way, as I said, invisible as fuck.

So yeah, at the time I finish typing it will probably going to be 5 AM, yeah, I've been awake that long but I'll be going to sleep after I post this, I really don't have a reason to sleep since there's nothing for me to look up to when I wake up.

Confused_42,lonely,1620248024.0,Wasted Platonic Energy,"
Hello everyone I hope you are having at least an ok day. I have massive amounts of platonic energy that has nowhere to go and I am constantly freaking out. All I want is to hug and embrace someone with them saying it will all be ok, and I would do the same back to them. I want to have that feeling that someone actually cares and you care back. None of these thoughts are sexual in nature and are purely focusing on just wishing someone was there. I want to cuddle with someone, to talk to them about all my crap and I listen to them talk about theirs. Someone to be there when times are hard for me and someone to be there for when times are hard for them. I feel I can never be loved because of the thing I am and my crippling social anxiety. I am kinda hopeless at this point with thoughts and feelings flying around my head aimlessly, I mean just look at my writing format. I have no life I sit at home and rot, yes I know I should get out and do stuff but my anxiety prevents it most of the time. 

That’s it, if you want to know a bit about me and my circumstances you can keep reading. Other than that thanks for reading my post

pokemom91,lonely,1620279691.0,It's my birthday but my husband is in the hospital,"Tomorrow is my 30th birthday. 
I'm spending the last night of my 20s really alone. My husband is in the hospital fighting an infection. I am glad he is getting better and will be coming home soon. We are actually really relieved because he has a diagnosis and answers and it's all going to be okay. 

Last year, my family forgot my birthday and also mothers day which comes a few days later. It was a really hurtful disappointment. I always had this idea that if my birthday were ever glazed over by my mate, I would consider that to be the end of it. 

I have spent most of this year with that disappointment in the back of my mind.  It bothers me and it was never really addressed or resolved, because It makes me feel greedy and undeserving or entitled and obnoxious. But my heart is broken over it.

But now the poor guy is in the hospital- who cares about a dumb birthday when your husband is in the hospital?  My daughter is crying. My toddler is confused. My oldest is moody. Celebrating isn't really on my mind. I'm worried. I miss him. 

My father died on my birthday 20 years ago this year as well so it's just all super uncomfortable and I can't help but feel sad right now. I don't have any friends.

aconitumvulparia,lonely,1620412818.0,So Done Feeling Lonely In My Own Family,"This situation literally just happened five minutes ago.

I was in a parking lot a few miles from where I live where there's many shops, heavy traffic, and lots of people around. I needed to make a phone call and rather doing that while I was driving, I figured I'd stop to make the call and then resume my drive home. Well, as I'm pulling out a heavily beat-up pickup truck pulls up with two men inside. They roll their windows down and proceed to try to coax me to roll my window down too. At this point I'm scared and I keep pulling out and screaming ""NO"", because they started to get out of their truck. I sped away and called my mom so someone would be on the phone with me until I got home. I told her what happened and that I was taking a different route to the house (we have about 4 different entrances to our neighborhood) and that I would be there soon. She proceeds to make fun of me saying ""Hannah, your dad is here you could've come straight home, just stop what you're doing you always over think stuff like this, it's a little ridiculous"". I then get home and my dad comes out waving his arms laughing, ""Where they at? Where they at? They're gonna get ya!"" I told him flatly, ""It's not funny, I was scared"". He responds with, ""It's hilarious."" And I stand up for myself saying, ""Yeah it's so hilarious they caught me off guard and scared me. So funny."" He then proceeds to go inside, slamming the door behind him. I follow, calling him out on his behavior and he says, ""I don't even recall saying it's hilarious."" WHEN HE JUST DID. I called my mom out on what she said too and she says what she always does, ""You look too much into things. Stop taking things so seriously."" They don't even try to be sympathetic, they just tear me down whatever chance they get and when I defend myself or call them out they respond with ""It's so sad you can't take a joke"". Like my mom will call me out for eating something and it going straight to my hips (I'm only 121 lbs) and my dad follows up with ""can't forget her face either, that's going to get fat too"". I feel so alone here. I'm moving to the UK in September for grad school, but I feel like I mentally/emotionally won't make it until then. I'm always made fun of and when I admonish the bad behavior they act like children. Even when I ignore it, they call me names and find new ways of ""joking"".

I know there's things I have to be grateful for, like free meals, a roof over my head, etc... I just don't feel like those things qualify someone to degrade me whenever they want. I'm just so done and so sick of it. The rest of my family is the same way too. I just don't understand why it's so hard for them to just be kind and considerate. I feel extremely isolated, lonely, and sad. I don't have the freedom to be myself here, so I'm always on my guard.

The_tormented_artist,lonely,1620145494.0,Vent,"Small vent, I just need to let it out somewhere.  


I feel so lonely( this must be the right sub for me). I don't really have anyone to go outside with or be fully open about my feelings. I'm comfortable enough to go by myself to the park, coffee shop or similar places to hang out and I'm not having a bad time, but... these past weeks I feel so unmotivated to do that because I have no one to meet anyway. I'm also not a fan of big groups as they bore me honestly, and prefer hanging out with 1-2 people at a time and so far I didn't find anyone in the same boat as me. I tried Tinder, but the connection just isn't there. I also went to an improv class for at least one year, went out with the people there, and I made a pretty good friend, but after a while I noticed I was putting more effort, stopped texting first...and eventually the friendship faded.

&#x200B;

It's hard to talk to others about your own loneliness because those who don't experience it so much think there must be a bad reason to why you don't have friends. I'm not the best, but I'm not a bad person either. I'm not any -phobic word, I always try to emotionally support my friends when they need to, I am a loyal friend and I have a whole universe I want to share. I don't look physically intimidating and I'm not some creep you'd wanna avoid at the gas station. It's just hard to find a meaningful connection since even as a kid I didn't have friends.

&#x200B;

I get little to no physical affection and I wish I could find someone to be with. I tried to open up about my loneliness to some friends I have, but they weren't so understanding and I can't blame them. I can't help but wonder what went wrong. Why do I have to be so introverted? Why can't I also be the type that makes friends easily? I just want one best friend, is that too much to ask for?

MissyMensa,lonely,1620063154.0,I think I’m meant to be alone,"I’ll start this by saying I’m a lucky person because I’ve never struggled with friendships or anything like that but love is a different story. 

I grew up a fat, tall black girl in a majority white school and area. I’ve always wanted reciprocated love. I’m a loving person and have always felt I want to love and be loved. For 23 years I never had reciprocated love or affection. 

Anyone I liked didn’t like me back and vice versa. I had my first kiss because someone initiated it for me at 17 and the next week at school the boy denied it even happened. He was obviously ashamed to have kissed me. 

I lost 40kgs lately and have been getting more make attention but not from anyone I actually like. I still don’t have the ideal body despite the weight loss. I still have a tummy that spills over and breast that look like they’ve taken a beating.
I don’t think I’m ugly but my love life being nonexistent makes me think there’s just something about me that’s unattractive and unlovable. 

Last year for the first time I had a reciprocated ‘relationship’. We had a great connection at first. Obviously since it was my first experience with any kind of love and affection I struggled to contain my emotions. I caught feelings, he didn’t (I’m assuming). Slowly but surely he started losing interest and I got less and less of his time, attention and affection. He keeps in contact (if you can even call it that) but I think it’s just because he wants to still have access to me. 

I miss him so much and I’m convinced I won’t find anyone to have a connection like this again. I feel so stupid for falling for him and thinking he would fall for me too. 

I so wish I didn’t crave romantic love and affection because I think I’m supposed to do life without love. I’ve been so lonely for so long and I don’t know how to get used to it. I don’t know how to accept that I might die never knowing what it’s like to love and be loved in return.",ill start say im lucky person ive never struggle friendships anything like love different story grow fat tall black girl majority white school area ive always want reciprocate love im love person always felt want love love nmbr years never reciprocate love affection anyone like like back vice versa first kiss someone initiate nmbr next week school boy deny even happen obviously ashamed kiss lose 40kgs lately get make attention anyone actually like still ideal body despite weight loss still tummy spill breast look like theyve take beat think im ugly love life nonexistent make think theres something thats unattractive unlovable last year first time reciprocate relationship great connection first obviously since first experience kind love affection struggle contain emotions catch feel im assume slowly surely start lose interest get less less time attention affection keep contact even call think want still access miss much im convince find anyone connection like feel stupid fall think would fall wish crave romantic love affection think im suppose life without love ive lonely long know get use know accept might die never know like love love return

Hsakaa03,lonely,1620483041.0,"18m, I've been getting more and more depressed since I've graduated high school.","People I loved and cared for everyday are no longer there for me anymore. I see them hang out together on social media but i never hear from them. On the hunt for new friends, I downloaded apps like tinder and Yubo, but everyone I tried reaching out to give a tenth of the effort of trying to become friends with me compared to what i gave them. I've always had trouble with friends, until my senior year of high school, every group I was in resulted in me getting bullied. I knew people always liked to bully the ugly kid so I started to improve myself, joined the gym, started taking proper care of my skin and hair, started dressing nicer. I've made significant progress but it didn't really help(honestly this part is really superficial I didn't expect this to be ""the solution""). I feel worse everyday, I don't think I'm a dickhead, I love being nice to people and caring for them. I think there's just something fundamentally wrong with me and it makes me not want to exist. I mostly love myself, but I'm really young and i just want people to enjoy the best years of my life with, which are yet to come.

I still end up in such a sad mood & to top it all off for some reason something always goes badly during it.

I've really valued my friendship especially with one person in particular & not even getting a ""happy bday"" message from them stings. 

Admittedly I did cry yesterday morning & tried to sleep my way through the day. I feel better now but I know that's partially because my birthday is over.

Blueyedgirl316,lonely,1620362752.0,33 and struggling ...!! 😑🤷🏼‍♀️,"I could sit here and type out a novel but I won’t. I will just recap the last few years. I used to drink a lot. A friend committed suicide. My best friend has 3 kids and is married to man she doesn’t even trust to leave for one night to watch their kids. My other friend never answers my calls and has only occasionally invited me be a third wheel. I’m a good person and I don’t know where to even make a connection anymore. I know that I can’t keep being the only one to ever make the effort. I work a full time job and deal with majorly difficult and hateful people who take their anger out on me. Some days I just want to cry. I just want good friends and it’s awful that I have ended up so secluded and exhausted from pouring so much of my heart into people that don’t even seem to care. And to top that off my ex from years ago fucked with my emotions and I allowed him to string me on for 6 years. Told me he wanted to marry me and have a family. He then left to live a van life. Not once did he show up or respect what I was so upfront with needing and asking for communication. I know that’s a lot. Obviously I haven’t gone into ALL the details but I’m trying.  I guess I posted this cause I wanted to at least feel like even for a moment that I am heard by someone. Felt like I needed to add my biggest emotional upsets that I’m sad that since I’m 33 and alone that I will never find love and that I will never experience being a mom. I hate feeling like I’ve convinced myself that I’ll never be loved. Plus I know I need counseling but I’ve been wanting to sit with an actual therapist but I don’t believe my state is even allowing that right now. I just want to be okay.

I've been like this all my life, but it's affecting me now cause I'm losing my friends, losing my mental health and feeling lonely. 

I already talked about it with them many times, but it's a decision my mother took, cause she was educated like this and doesn't know other thing. Definitely I can't convince her or them and I need to adapt myself to the rules

I can do it if I propose to, I can be hanging out with friends or going to wherever I'd want, but i don't want to have problems. They can kick me out of the house and I don't have no money to start living by my own, and it's difficult to start living like this in my country from overnight cause I've never worked before. 

It's even more difficult cause the college take most of my time, like from 9am to 5pm. And if they don't kick me they'll take my few privileges, what would make it worst living here :(( , i think I'm going crazy. I'm only allowed to go out if I get a job, but it's the same case, I'll need to leave the college 


I can't even invite a friend to come or have a pet. Its all so lonely and feels wrong

I'm desperate already. I just wanted to vent. It's hard to believe for me that the person that it supposed to love me the most in the world is doing me this.

i miss my old life really bad, i miss my old friends, my house, basically everything about it. 
i used to live in a capital city. it was very famous and popular, but i didn’t like it, but i miss my life there. basically my whole life i’ve been moving back and forth to specific cities and. it sucks. i lived in the capital for a long time, around 6 years in total (9 if you include the times i stayed there when i was young before being raised for a few years in england and moving back) and some friends, moved to a city and lived in my grandmas for a year, made friends, moved back, stayed for two years, got stuck in my grandmas house for a few months during the beginning of covid. then moved there, this time permanently. got an apartment, lived there for awhile. before getting a house.

i miss my old friends, fro, both schools, the ones from my old school were my best friends, but now im forgotten to them (literally they forgot i existed) , never answer my texts, always are busy when they do, and they changed, not the same people i became friends with. we dont have that same type of vibe, it feels dull and fake when i text them. now 2 of them havent answered my texts in like half a year (will soon be a full year ig)  

from my school that im currently school i despise them, theyre snobby, shit bro i didnt do anything to you? why you suddenly acting like i murdered your mom or stole your fucking phone holy shit.they also forgot about me. i don’t consider them my friends.

i talk to one person every day, probably two or three per month in total, and the two others are only my mom asking me to do a chore, or the delivery guy.

i get so so lonely, i see my friends posting about them hanging out all the time now that they finished school a few days ago. i’m just there watching it.

i’m watching my life go by, not actually living it. 

i can’t talk to my mom or dad about it, they’re abusive. mom doesn’t care about me, broken relationship, and she always looks for reasons to be mad, doesn’t care about my health or my wishes. dad doesn’t even have a relationship with me, also abusive. he just cares about my baby twin siblings and my younger brother. awkward when i’m with him or look at him.


i want to be with my old friends and have my normal happy relationship with them, i miss meeting up at my old school and ditching together or crying together about exams and teachers, making up ghost stores, and when we met up too early we’d get freaked out my the dark halls.sneaking into the kindergartners playgrounds, or getting freaked out at bugs and running away from the janitor. or some dumb stuff, then meeting up at our houses and . now they do that without me. i understand, i’m unattractive, boring, dull, lonely, and lives somewhere else. i just spend all my time in my room watching anime or ranting and crying to my cousin who i think of as the dearest person on my life. it’s dumb ik, i mean having a cousin who you think of as the most important person in your life or sister. she’s also just like me. by that i mean same everything, opinions, likes dislikes suicidal maniacs ,abusive parents ,shit like that. 

i wanna die, i’m sick of life, only reasons why is bc i don’t wanna go to hell, and i’m too much of a pussy to hurt myself, bc i get hurt easily and hate pain, but i wanna die a painless quick death and live an ok afterlife in heaven. probably reunite with my grand aunt and a few people i want to see again.

rae_jule,lonely,1620386293.0,i feel like i lost my friends and i was a part of the problem but they say they're still my friends,"before you read,, 1. spoilers are going to be bad words because I just want to vent and have people help me.2. this started because of a dumb math question. me and one girl, lets call her A, had a lot of tense>! shit!< between us already, so you can already tell I was annoyed because of other things that have happened. i will explain this stuff at the end of the post.

so a couple weeks ago, me + 2 other ppl (one is my ""friend""..? we will call her S, and A) were talking about a stupid PEMDAS question.I was just explaining that PEMDAS and BEDMAS is the same. i think we all got heated bc of different sides and idk it just happens that when people are frustrated we tend to get aggressive. I think I was annoyed because, I was explaining to S, and she wasn't listening to what I was saying and kept going with her own thing because she thought she was right. anyways, I really don't care about pemdas, it was a joke to show the equation and have them answer it and see if they got it right. i didn't mean any arguing to start.

anyways, we were all annoyed and (honestly I'm not sure how it even started) but we all got really mad at each other. i then proceeded to say some >!shitty!< stuff to A (I basically told her I wont miss A when she moves because i just want someone who doesnt judge me for what i say and how i act) I KNOW THAT IT WAS WRONG.  please don't tell me because it will make me feel worse LOLS and A literally told me to say it, and I was already mad that A kept saying things like K and just not responding literally and just saying nevermind, and I didnt want to act like her because its annoying (will talk about it later)

so i said that and they both got mad at me because i said it when they wanted me to, and i told them the times A judged me and they got mad for setting boundaries and distancing myself from A which she got mad about bc apparently i wasnt giving them enough clues. I think not responding to texts and just saying things that meant that i didnt really want to talk to A.

then they proceed to yell at me for being sad/disappointed bc of a relationship thing

(basically, A asked me to be her valentine and I said yes but I don't know if i want it to be romantic or just as friends, and then my friend, T, asked A out the day after valentines, and A, apparently having private feelings about T, ditches all her feelings for me and goes and dates T. their relationship didn't work out.)

and then S and A tell me I wasnt giving A enough hints that i was interested and I wasn't giving enough effort, so she moved on, apparently.then S and A proceeded to tell me that I shouldve just chose my feelings (that i liked A or not)and then after A just switched to dating T I put a song on my private instagram (IM SORRY ITS SO CRINGEY BUT I DID IT)and A had to bring it up and tell me I was overreacting because I put it on my story. Then also proceeded to quiz me on Rod Wave, and I calmly told her that just because I knew one of their songs doesn't mean I know/am a fan of the actual artist and told me i overreacted because i put a song on my story..?

and then R (another girl who idk if shes my friend anymore) came in and confronted me A and S and started to turn on me but also got mad at S and A for this argument

anyways that was that and A and I arent friends anymore, and I have no idea what to do. I feel like all three of them (A, S and R) are talking about me behind my back, cause I talked to R and asked her if they had a groupchat together and they said yes, but not to talk about me or a gc which is like ""oh no don't add her"" type of thing and i feel like im just left out bc they call and do a lot of >!shit!< there w/o me and i feel like they dont like me anymore

so the thing that i was talking about earlier - that happened with me and A

in my priv dms, i asked for a phone number of another girl cause i wanted to talk to her about schools. then A comes and confronts me and says like - ""you always have your ways"" and tells me that ""you should think about how you've been acting"" and then tells me nevermind.  
so i tell her, idk how ive been acting  
and then tells me that ive been leaving her on delivered and ignoring me when she talks to me, when i've been choosing not to because she always ruined my mental health bc of other stuff thats happened (she also outed me to R :\[ ) as well as the whole dating T thing  
i send her a long paragraph of how she's done some mean >!shit!< that i dont appreciate, and she just sends me ""cool"" and i tell her that my mental health issues arent cool  
and then she proceeds to come at me with ""and what do u care abt my mental health, if u want me to care for urs"" which doesnt really make sense  
anyways, i tell her that now that i've proved her wrong she just backs down and she comes at me with the classic ""you want a medal"" and ""you never think about what others feel"" and i tell her that I do care about how people feel, everyday, but that if someone treats me like she did i probably don't care about what she feels (because i never talk to her other than school) and then she tells me that ""every single day you're bugging me"" and honestly, what am i supposed to do about it? and then tells me she didnt actually out me that R just ""figured it out"" after the T relationship thing  
and she tells me that shes trying to gain my trust back and i tell her that thats nice, but it doesnt really happen after she betrayed it more than once :)

then a couple days later she says sorry.

&#x200B;

now idk what to do with T and S because they mean so much to me but apparently they leave me out and i want to confront them but i know theyll just be pissed that i have my own feelings and emotions.

please help me and let me know wtf to do <3",read 1 spoilers go bad word want vent people help 2 start dumb math question one girl let call lot tense shit us already already tell annoy things happen explain stuff end post couple weeks ago nmbr ppl one friend call talk stupid pemdas question explain pemdas bedmas think get heat bc different side idk happen people frustrate tend get aggressive think annoy explain listen say keep go thing think right anyways really care pemdas joke show equation answer see get right mean argue start anyways annoy honestly sure even start get really mad proceed say shitty stuff basically tell miss move want someone judge say act know wrong please tell make feel worse lols literally tell say already mad keep say things like k respond literally say nevermind want act like annoy talk later say get mad say want tell time judge get mad set boundaries distance get mad bc apparently give enough clue think respond texts say things mean really want talk proceed yell sad disappoint bc relationship thing basically ask valentine say yes know want romantic friends friend ask day valentines apparently private feel ditch feel go date relationship work tell give enough hint interest give enough effort move apparently proceed tell choose feel like switch date put song private instagram im sorry cringey bring tell overreact put story also proceed quiz rod wave calmly tell know one songs mean know fan actual artist tell overreact put song story r another girl idk friend anymore come confront start turn also get mad argumentanyways friends anymore idea feel like three r talk behind back cause talk r ask groupchat together say yes talk gc like oh add type thing feel like im leave bc call lot shit w feel like like anymoreso thing talk earlier happen priv dms ask phone number another girl cause want talk school come confront say like always ways tell think act tell nevermind tell idk ive act tell ive leave deliver ignore talk choose always ruin mental health bc stuff thats happen also r well whole date thing send long paragraph mean shit appreciate send cool tell mental health issue cool proceed come u care abt mental health u want care urs really make sense anyways tell prove wrong back come classic want medal never think others feel tell care people feel everyday someone treat like probably care feel never talk school tell every single day bug honestly suppose tell actually r figure relationship thing tell try gain trust back tell thats nice really happen betray couple days later say sorry x200b idk mean much apparently leave want confront know theyll piss feel emotions please help let know wtf 3
sunshine1034,lonely,1620094174.0,Going to college was not as expected and now I’m lonely as ever,"I thought going into college I would be making life-long friends, and create memories I would forever remember as I was always told. However, I couldn’t be any more lonelier. I haven’t made any real friends at my school and it’s extremely hard considering I don’t live on campus. The only opportunities I have to meet people are during class and you can’t really talk during class. I live almost two hours away from any family or close friends I’ve had. The only time I don’t feel lonely is when I get to visit over summer and I’m surrounded by the people I love. It’s so incredibly depressing not having a social life at all. I was so desperate to meet new people that I went to a few parties, and risked my own safety and others just to have a social outing. I ended up getting too drunk, and everyone hated me. I was called “annoying” and told I was acting childish by seriously, almost everyone there. I even got threats from some random ass guys. It didn’t go well at all and it was a stupid idea to go to a party in the middle of a pandemic in the first place. But I just got so tired of laying in bed all day with nobody to talk to. I’ve tried for so long to make new friends but I don’t seem to have the personality that attracts people. I can come off as a bitch or intimidating but I’m always extremely nice and caring when people take the time to get to know me. I don’t really understand why I’m having such a hard time making friends, considering I’m extremely extroverted. Which is why I feel so uncomfortable being alone often. I seem to meet people but never form close relationships with them. Is this just part of growing up & maturing? I’m still trying to find my way through this bullshit.",think go college would make life long friends create memories would forever remember always tell however lonelier make real friends school extremely hard consider live campus opportunities meet people class cant really talk class live almost two hours away family close friends ive time feel lonely get visit summer im surround people love incredibly depress social life desperate meet new people go party risk safety others social end get drink everyone hat call annoy tell act childish seriously almost everyone even get threats random ass guy go well stupid idea go party middle pandemic first place get tire lay bed day nobody talk ive try long make new friends seem personality attract people come bitch intimidate im always extremely nice care people take time get know really understand im hard time make friends consider im extremely extroverted feel uncomfortable alone often seem meet people never form close relationships part grow mature im still try find way bullshit
FilthyGorgeous1221,lonely,1620212981.0,The support system factor,"My depression & anxiety is out of control, Its by far the worst it’s ever been.  I’ve done pretty much everything, I’ve been on every antidepressant out there, countless therapists, support groups, even a brief hospitalization and ever single thing has been a bandaid fix at best.  The reason I always fail & ultimately end up back hiding from the world in bed is because I have no support system to help me with the bad moments.  I used to have a loving family that would always lift me up but now the ones who truly loved me are dead & the remainder of my family turned their backs on me.  I don’t have any friends left, I don’t have a job because I am on disability right now & unable to work which means I literally spend 100% of my time alone, the only human interaction I get is saying hi to the pharmacist when I pick up my meds.....

I don’t remember what it feels like to be loved 

I can take the strongest medication available or go through the best mental health program possible but at the end of the day I am completely alone & unloved. So I keep asking myself what is the point? 

Everyone complains about their family & takes them for granted .... but I’d do absolutely anything in this world just for 1 person I could call real family.

throwawayokina,lonely,1619931016.0,I hugged someone,"I hugged someone in a dream. My dreams are typically very vague and I do not feel much sensation (vision, hearing, touch) while in it; rather it is characterised by events and people. But this dream gave me a complete sensory overload.

 We were at a house party/gathering and I was chilling about with my friends. Suddenly, I heard someone ring the doorbell. I went to open the door, only to see my classmate and ex-crush crying. Like the kind of crying where you know something groundbreakingly bad has happened. Before I knew it, I jumped forward into a tight hug, feeling absolutely shitty about how I could not help her.

I could feel everything. My palms on her back. Our chins resting on each others' shoulders. The warmth of a hug. 

The reality of the experience was second only to real life. Words alone cannot describe how strong I felt the emotions and sensations. 

I have several good friends. But as my friends don't show physical affection, this was the first time I had a hug this powerful and emotional. 

I realise now that I am horribly starved of physical affection - till the point that my brain created a situation to fulfill this subconscious desire. I'm even surprised that my brain could even remember the sensation of being in a hug.

Thank you for reading my rant. Wishing you have a good day/night ahead.",hug someone dream dream typically vague feel much sensation vision hear touch rather characterise events people dream give complete sensory overload house party gather chill friends suddenly hear someone ring doorbell go open door see classmate ex crush cry like kind cry know something groundbreakingly bad happen know jump forward tight hug feel absolutely shitty could help could feel everything palm back chin rest others shoulder warmth hug reality experience second real life word alone describe strong felt emotions sensations several good friends friends show physical affection first time hug powerful emotional realise horribly starve physical affection till point brain create situation fulfill subconscious desire even surprise brain could even remember sensation hug thank read rant wish good day night ahead

I've always found playing video games much more satisfying and effortless than real life. And I think like a lot of people, we've all had the thought of what life would be like if it were a video game.

I've built an app to help me organize my life and it's working really well right now that some friends have started using it. If anyone is interested in optimizing their life, let me know

By the time I reached, it started to hit me so I drank the second to amplify it. Forced it down in my room.

rainpawsherbet,lonely,1620208569.0,I don't know how to connect with other people. Please help me,"I just recently got into college and I know the immediate thing I should do to survive is to make friends so that I don't have to go through everything on my own. Especially knowing that college life wasn't going to be easier than high school. Unfortunately, making friends has never been something that I can do with ease.

 I've talked to some of my classmates several times, but no one seems to be interested in being friends with me. I feel like no matter how hard I try to initiate a friendship, it always ends up with them being not more than just acquaintances or people I know from college. I don't know whether it's my boring personality or that I'm just not likeable. I have social anxiety, am very shy and quiet, but it's not like I haven't made any effort to interact with other people. Socializing takes huge courage and I would be beating myself up If I mess up the slightest bit of my social interactions.

I  know that later in the future when I finally graduate college and continue to working life, this is going to be a greater problem because If I'm not able to form connections with people, I wouldn't have the chance to get a decent job or even a job at all since we all know how important networking is in professional world.

I'm aware that this is all my fault because it doesn't only happen in college. Ever since I was in kindergarten, I never really had decent amount of friends and had often sat alone because no one would wanna talk to me. Everywhere I go, it all comes back to me being friendless, lonely, and depressed. What's the point of living if we, humans, as social creatures aren't even capable of being social?

I’m a postgrad student, and I’ve realized that lately, a lot of the friends I made in highschool and undergrad don’t talk to me anymore. Some I’ve messaged once or even twice, and never even got a reply. I understand everyone at this age is going through it, trying to figure themselves out, moving cities or countries, getting jobs, getting into relationships, making new friends in new places, or simply moving on. And I 100% support that; it just sucks when you feel like you’re being left behind... I know that in life, people change and outgrow past relationships. So there are moments when I think to myself ‘oh, that person has probably just outgrown this relationship with me, or they’re just too busy and I’m simply not a priority anymore.. or maybe I wasn’t to begin with?’. I’m someone who struggles with being alone, and I’m trying to learn how to do that, to accept that life goes on and it’s okay to not have that many friends. But it’s just been very difficult lately, when you see everyone is getting on with their lives, and the ones that are still left... seem to slowly be slipping away, while I’m trying my very best to hold on to the few lasting friendships I have left, and I feel like a burden to the ones who are still here. It’s been a tough year, just struggling to navigate this feat in particular.",im postgrad student ive realize lately lot friends make highschool undergrad talk anymore ive message even twice never even get reply understand everyone age go try figure move cities countries get job get relationships make new friends new place simply move 100 support suck feel like leave behind know life people change outgrow past relationships moments think oh person probably outgrow relationship theyre busy im simply priority anymore maybe begin im someone struggle alone im try learn accept life go okay many friends difficult lately see everyone get live ones still leave seem slowly slip away im try best hold last friendships leave feel like burden ones still tough year struggle navigate feat particular
aneptuniangrl,lonely,1620076831.0,Am I jealous or is there something there?,"Hi guys. So I’m a 21F and i have this friend that I’m not sure I’m jealous of or if she’s weird. I can say I think she’s prettier than me but I also think I’m pretty as well. Whenever we go, men will completely IGNORE me and try to talk to her forwardly. Sometimes there’s the awkward moment where I told her I have my eyes on a guy and he asks me for HER number. It hurts but I let it go. 

Now when she has a new boy toy, she introduces me and my personality tends to sparkle more than hers. There was this one moment where she showed me on FaceTime to a guy and he called me cute and she said “cute?!” In this jealous way towards him. And when we first smoked weed together there were times where it felt like she thought I was ugly or would become super sensitive and lash out. 

So she texts me one day to tell me she met this guy friend and he’s cute and she wants to hook us up so we can double date with her boyfriend. Automatically i cringed bc I hate blind dates but also bc the last guy she hooked me up with liked her instead. So I’m hesitant blah blah he calls me cute and gets my Instagram info. Now...later that night he sends her a screenshot of the ONE picture me and her have together and calls her a star. From that moment on I knew he liked her. Fast forward a few months later she tells me that he kissed her in his car. This pissed me off bc why would u try to hook us up if u knew all along he liked her. I literally told her that first day to make sure he doesn’t like her and she was so confident, that now it seems like she was full of shit. 

But she tearfully assured me that wasn’t what she was trying to do. She rebuffs his advances and never speaks to him again. Fast forward to some months later, she broke up with her boyfriend and is chatting with me and brings up that same guy. This time she’s speaking like she’s thinking about hooking up with him and the whole time I’m wondering if she forgot I was mad about that and that this isn’t a good look.

Am I wrong to be pissed off? Like I have feelings. I know damn well when a guy is attracted to me so I feel like she knew too but she felt she could throw him to me. Is this jealousy bc of how overlooked I feel sometimes or what?",hi guy im 21f friend im sure im jealous weird say think prettier also think im pretty well whenever go men completely ignore try talk forwardly sometimes theres awkward moment tell eye guy ask number hurt let go new boy toy introduce personality tend sparkle one moment show facetime guy call cute say cute jealous way towards first smoke weed together time felt like think ugly would become super sensitive lash texts one day tell meet guy friend hes cute want hook us double date boyfriend automatically cringe bc hate blind date also bc last guy hook like instead im hesitant blah blah call cute get instagram info later night send screenshot one picture together call star moment know like fast forward months later tell kiss car piss bc would u try hook us u know along like literally tell first day make sure like confident seem like full shit tearfully assure try rebuff advance never speak fast forward months later break boyfriend chat bring guy time speak like think hook whole time im wonder forget mad good look wrong piss like feel know damn well guy attract feel like know felt could throw jealousy bc overlook feel sometimes

And the one that I hate the most is when they say ""I love you, I do care"" no the fuck you don't, you don't know anything about me you literally are incapable of loving me, stop saying something that I've wanted to hear for so long in such a shallow way I swear to fucking God. I don't think words are enough for me to trust anyone anymore, which is the only thing that can even be fucking exchanged here. And no one around me would give me anything, not even words. If you have nothing to say, don't. I don't want to see you sucking your dick in front of me. All I want is for someone to hug me and to tell me it's all okay, and no one can do that. I just want to scream at the top of my lung and I can't even do that, it all just keeps accumulating and the only way for me to let out is to hit myself, or punch a fucking wall. Everything hurts.

marmalademadam,lonely,1619939996.0,It hurts so much to lose a friend,"I feel like I’m missing a member of my family. My world got colder and smaller since. Especially since he’s alive. And we’re just missing out on each other’s lives now. 

I just feel like I’m not *done* being his friend. I feel like he’s my family. But I’ve done more than my share of fighting for him. I reached out twice but he never took my hand. 

We had a lot of issues between us, so I decided that it was healthy to take some space. I think he partly felt like he had screwed things up to a point that he couldn’t possibly fix any of it. That I hated him now or something. 

But all I needed was a genuine apology or a chance to talk things out. I tried to talk things and always kept my language neutral and chose my words so carefully but his self hatred got in the way. 

I feel unbearably lonely. He let go. He gave me no choice but to force myself to move on, but I feel stuck. I reach out for my phone sometimes and remember that he’s not on my chat list. Or I have dreams about him every night and they feel so real. 

It’s ironic because I have plenty of other friends and deep connections, so I’m not “lonely” on surface, but to lose someone that close to me makes me feel like I’ve lost ten people at once.",feel like im miss member family world get colder smaller since especially since hes alive miss others live feel like im friend feel like hes family ive share fight reach twice never take hand lot issue us decide healthy take space think partly felt like screw things point possibly fix hat something need genuine apology chance talk things try talk things always keep language neutral choose word carefully self hatred get way feel unbearably lonely let go give choice force move feel stick reach phone sometimes remember hes chat list dream every night feel real ironic plenty friends deep connections im lonely surface lose someone close make feel like ive lose ten people

I did not make many friends although I briefly had a ""girl friend"". This is in quotes because I'm not sure if we were in love as she avoided me most of the time (in public but we talk online since she left the country where I am and she says she misses me a lot, weird).
I am about to graduate and go back home having not gone there since I left and don't know how I'll answer questions about my time here. People expect living abroad to be fun, but for me it has been the loneliest and most boring phase of my life.
If it helps, I am non white in an Asian country. I sometimes wish I had tried to ask someone out.

Will I ever make new friends and find love? I really wish I would feel love again.

Meat_Bus,lonely,1619947818.0,Gonna be by myself for a while,"So, the past few years for me have been bliss. Throughout high school I was a huge loner, but I guess I didn’t really realize how negatively it was affecting me. I switched into a boarding school my sophomore year in high school and immediately found my home. The next 3 years living in that dorm were amazing, I had friends that understood me and they’re honestly family to me for life. When we all went off to college, most of us split off all across the country, so we knew we wouldn’t be seeing each other anymore. I’ve kept contact with 3 of them, moving in and sharing a house with one of them. Fast forward to now, I’ve been in college 3 years and still have about 2 years to go. I have a wonderful girlfriend who I’ve been dating for 2 1/2 years now, and I can’t wait to marry her. She’s the love of my life and I know she’s gonna be my wife. We’ve lived together with one of my best friends from high school for about 2 years. But now everything is changing. My girlfriend is in med tech and is going back to our hometown (3 1/2 hour drive from me) with our dog for her internship, which will last for a year. My best friend is graduating this year. He has a job working for Amazon now as a software engineer and is moving to Virginia (we are currently in Louisiana.) My other two best friends live about 4 hours away from me at any point in time, and I hardly have time to travel given my engineering degree I’m working towards. I mainly interact with my buddies via discord, and was part of a fairly large group but for the past month nearly all of them have just been gone. Not sure why, most likely that’s a whole other story, but long story short I guess I just won’t be talking to them anymore, so that’s sad considering we all talked daily for the better part of 3 years, me taking the time to build this small community and introduce everybody, bringing them together just to watch them leave. All to sum up, by the end of the month, I’m going to be the most alone that I’ve been in YEARS. And I guess I just don’t know how I ever handled it before, or how to now. I’m so used to being able to talk to someone I’m close to every day that this past month just without the buddies I had online is driving me crazy, I don’t know how I’m going to handle being completely alone, working on these stupidly hard classes just trying to get my degree so I can get out and marry my girlfriend. 

Sorry if that was a long read, I appreciate if any of you took the time to.

lexiebeef,lonely,1620148317.0,I lost the one quality I always had,"First of all, let me give you some context. Since I (F21) can remember, I was never the pretty one (always a tomboy and not the cool type) and I never was the nice person (Im not saying Im an asshole, but the word people most use to describe me is def not nice). But one thing I always had were brains. Im no genious, at all, but I always studied a lot (it helps when you have 0 friends) and so I always had great grades. I always won fights about controversial topics (race, sexuality, politics...) and that was kind of my most visible quality.

But in the last year, I lost that. Im in my third year of law school and this semester I always say everything wrong, my grades are shit and a professor literally told me today “you talk in a terrible way”.  Besides that, this year has been so exausthing I just lost all track of news and whatever, making me always being criticized at every discussion. And for some reason, people have been complaining about the way i talk a lot (too loud, too fast, with a lisp...). 

Im not saying every person will relate to this, but it was the one thing I had garanteed was that, even if I would end up alone, I would have a good job, where I could do a meaningful thing. And now, I dont even have that.

Basically, what I feel is that instead of improving and becoming a better person, I am losing the few good things. And that sucks, because it makes me understand why I am so alone. 

Why would anyone like me if I suck?",first let give context since f21 remember never pretty one always tomboy cool type never nice person im say im asshole word people use describe def nice one thing always brain im genious always study lot help nmbr friends always great grade always win fight controversial topics race sexuality politics kind visible quality last year lose im third year law school semester always say everything wrong grade shit professor literally tell today talk terrible way besides year exausthing lose track news whatever make always criticize every discussion reason people complain way talk lot loud fast lisp im say every person relate one thing garanteed even would end alone would good job could meaningful thing even basically feel instead improve become better person lose good things suck make understand alone would anyone like suck

I couldn't handle the ambiguity and uncertainty of our relationship, because he has too much shit to work through to be able to tell me whether he wants to be with me platonically or romantically. I'm in love with him, but even if he'd decided he just wanted to be friends, that would be okay. I would move on eventually. But I couldn't make myself move on like that when I knew there was a chance that once he worked through his trauma and various mental health issues, he'd realize he wanted me the way he said he did when he was drunk.

Seeing his name every day on Discord, him messaging me occasionally, it's been fucking me up emotionally a lot. I'm so lonely in general, it's hard not having any local friends, and having him ""there"", but not really was just too painful. I felt constantly rejected. I don't blame him at all, but I needed a break, and told him so today, asking him to get back in touch with me when he's decided on something (relationship, friendship, no contact, whatever - I just want to know what he really wants). And I'm pretty sure it hurt him, or bothered him, or something, because of the way he replied.

I'm going to reach out to people, going to try and be as social as I can, because I'm done making this mistake. Rejection happens, but I can't keep going on like this, isolated from other people. It messes up other areas of my life, and I let my anxiety hold me back from developing solid connections, so all I ever *know* is rejection.

It hurts so much though. I don't know if he'll actually get back to me. His last words to me were ""not really"". When I said I loved him, he didn't return it, despite telling me he loved me literally last night.

chickenlessb0ne,lonely,1620590858.0,How to build yourself into not being lonely,"Hello all. Just want to start off by saying if you’re lonely, you’re not alone. There’s nothing wrong with you. Billions of people across the globe feel the same way. Study after study shows that with an increase in our reliance on technology, especially with the pandemic, there’s an increase in individuals experiencing loneliness. Many of you may actually enjoy being alone like me! You come home, make some food, take a seat, boot up that PS4/pick up that guitar/turn on the TV, rain begins coming down slowly, and with no work tomorrow you get to chill all by yourself. It’s an amazing feeling... until you do this, over and over again, and the feelings every human experiences of being in a tribe/community/relationship (that word can hurt) begins to kick in and you realize that being alone doesn’t actually make you...happy. Believe me, I’ve experienced this for YEARS, and it’s a long, painful process to make friends, find outgoing hobbies, meet people and create adventures, but it’s entirely do-able. Here’s what I suggest so you don’t make the same mistakes I did. 

1- Workout 
-I know it’s not easy, especially in a pandemic but I can’t even begin to explain all the benefits to working out. It’s sounds dumb, but it makes you happier, more confident, obviously better looking, and fills you with a sense of pride and accomplishment. I recommend creating a goal for yourself and sticking with a training plan. I became very passionate about running and it was super awesome. Although you won’t begin to see the results for a while, the more you do it, the more you’ll want to keep going back. 

2- Try Bumble friends/Facebook groups 
-You don’t even need to find friends naturally anymore, you can quite literally meet people through the internet now. Some of the best in-person friends that I’ve made were through social media/apps. When it comes to dating apps, I’d wait until you made some friends first. Having a social circle is the most basic building block of not being lonely. Relationships will come in time, and if they don’t work out you have friends to fall back on. 

3- Try and find new hobbies 
-Having new and interesting hobbies (even ones that you do alone) will really help create an interesting you. For me, it was bread-making, cooking, guitar playing, painting, finding a hiking/biking Facebook group, and joining a community service group. Also, journaling really helps put thoughts down on paper to clear your mind. Shoot your shot at tons of different hobbies and I guarantee a few will stick long term. 

4- Be as nice as possible to anyone and everyone you meet 
-This is for those who have social anxiety/are socially awkward. Not only does a smile make people instantly like you more and want to keep you around, you will quite literally make yourself happy. Yes, it maybe putting on a face, but do it until it becomes your actual face. 

5- Read “How to Win Friends and Influence people” by Dale Carnegie
-For me, it’s essentially the ultimate tactical book for dealing with people, and it kinda changed my life. Meeting new people and not being lonely means you need to understand people. You’ve spent years understanding yourself, now it’s time you understand everyone else. 

6- “If it makes you nervous, do it”
-Walking into the gym makes you feel intimidated? Do it anyway. Hopping on Tinder makes you feel nervous and more lonely? Do it anyway (but don’t binge). Don’t even want to get out of bed??? Do it anyway. Trying the things you hate the most will open up more doors than you thought possible. Breaking out of your comfort zone means putting yourself in positions of being uncomfortable, but it’s super exciting. Life, for me at least, was meant to be an adventure, not a day to day drone of things that aren’t exciting. 

I don’t want to come off as some motivational speaker, but PLEASE understand that it’s NEVER too late, even if you’re 45-50 years old, you can still get the fuck out there and change your life, because I did and I feel great. This isn’t going to come as some 80s montage either; it’s going to be hard work but it’s with worth it. 5 years ago I was lurking very often on this subreddit, and now I’m happier than ever. Sure, sometimes I don’t even want to get out of bed, and I’ve gotten my heart broken more times that I can count, but it’s definitely allot more adventurous than living my life though a fucking screen. I implore you, please try everything I said earlier. When it comes to burnout, of course try everything in moderation. There will be some days you don’t want to get up, or you continue to feel lonely MONTHS after trying new things. The time will come, I know it because it happened to me. A year in to rebuilding myself, I still spent Friday nights alone. Trust the process and take this as an adventure, like a quest in some kind of video game, and get out there and start living life. That one friend you make can turn into 3, 4, 8, and eventually a whole circle of amigos to hang with. If you’re looking for a relationship, never stop looking. Love can be around every corner, you just have to have the strength to reach every corner. Please remember confidence is key, you will get your heart broken but it’s better than never even trying.

This is your life, now fight for it. Whatever YouTube video, book, quote, saying, motivational whatever the fuck gets you up and moving, use it. For me, it was Man of Steel (the movie). It took me 5 YEARS to build myself from a chubby 17 year old depressed kid who played 8+ hours of games a day to a 22 year old guy who genuinely enjoys life. I didn’t hold a girls hand until I was 21, and that’s OK! I never even thought that I would even be able to TALK to girls, and now I do on a daily basis, and YOU CAN TOO (or dudes if that’s your thing). 

I hope this message finds you well. Just understand that what you maybe going through right now is just a low point in your life, and the highs have yet to come. Build yourself day in and day out, and your future you will thank the present you, because I currently thank the past me for going through all his trials and tribulations, and to have the strength to get out of bed and stop staring at a screen.

I question every day where i went wrong in my life to end up where im at now. Could i have made a different choice and had a better out come?

I found it weird that today they sent a pic of them having fun and i just broke down.... I have no idea why i honestly feel proud of them cuz ive always wanted them to live their best lives but something in me broke i realized what ive been doing for the past 4 years of my life was a waste and i knew it was a waste and i just cant tolerate this type of routine/ lifestyle.

I usually eventually try to fix my mistake of ghosting for months or years by trying to reconnect but things are never the same and it's even more difficult to hold a conversation. I just feel like I'm gonna suffocate whenever I reconnect because it was my fault because I felt like a horrible friend or person and that they are better off without me. 

They kinda show that they are better without me by never trying to initiate another conversation after I never respond the first time they never try again that's why I feel comfortable ghosting because it felt like they didn't want to talk to me anyways. A lot of conversations are started by me despite my horrible anxiety because I really try to change and keep friends and try to get close but they consistently show me that it seems that they don't want to talk to me at all so I distance myself so far and ghost for months. Even friends that I had so much fun talking to seem like they don't want to talk to me because they don't start conversations. So again I disappear. I hate this and I've lost all my friends can't talk like I used to just trying to not be negative like I always am. So then we never talk again. I try so hard but everyone makes me feel so unwanted and annoying. I just wanna die for feeling this way about them I just feel like trash. I have a spending problem because I feel so empty inside.

MyNamePrecedesMe,lonely,1619846093.0,I need someone to help me stay sane and there's no one to help me stay sane,"I have severe PTSD. I'm on disability, which they decided to review \*right\* after giving me public housing. There have only been two places who will accept me that I could actually live in and literally both of the landlords are trying to find ways to steal from me.

&#x200B;

I can't go out and meet people because I have a fear of being in public for long and it stresses me terribly to talk to people I don't know in person. (I come off normal but it takes a great toll so I can't do it all the time.) I have three people in my life and they're all toxic, but I feel like I can't cut them out because they're the only people that exist to me and I can't meet anyone new. One is an 'ex' who's still very emotionally abuse to me even though he moved away. One is another ex, same basic situation but not so much abusive as just a clinical narcissist who uses everyone. And finally my very rageful, emotionally unstable sister, whom I don't talk to much. (The reason for the PTSD is related to extensive childhood abuse so I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the history of abuse and the fact that my sister is unstable.)

So everyone just says ""Oh he told you you'll never do anything right and all your childhood abuse is your fault and you're a moron etc etc? Well just stop talking to him."" But I'm already losing my mind because there's no one to talk to and everything is falling apart. I can't find a place to live and I might lose my chance to move to move. My washtub just broke. My weird neighbor is randomly rearranging everything on my porch and it's freaking me out. My dog needs a vet visit and I can't afford it. I can't \*tell\* you all the things going wrong in my life, and I have this strong instinct that things are going to be much worse soon.

And there's no one to talk to who doesn't tell me it's all my fault or I'm an idiot or who cares or listens. I literally feel like the walls are closing in or I can't breathe- like all the time. I need \*someone\*.

How do i get out of this state of mind ? All my conversations are simple hellos and i try to engage with others in my hobby but i do not know how to make friends or that i even people would want to be friends. 

I had a 7 year relationship and a thriving social life with many great people in the first few years but since ending that\`14 months ago i have no one.

TheOtherNPC,lonely,1620287739.0,I’m done with my local “club” as they literally don’t care about me or what I do,"When I moved to my current town in 2018 I had no friends or family in the area so I joined a local sports club to try and meet people.

It was clear they weren’t the most sociable bunch but it was a start. After 5 months they hit hard times as they were too lazy to recruit new people as old ones left. I bent over backwards advertising online and putting up flyers which worked to bring in new people while they just moaned about how screwed the club was. Not once did I get a thank you but I thought it would count for something in the long run. 

Covid hit and we shut down, not one person spoke to me since last March even if I reached out to people, until recently when I was contact to ask to basically dig them out a hole because they didn’t bother to rebook the usual venue so have no where to host it. I said no, I wasn’t rude but just I couldn’t. 

Guess what, not even a reply and every time I’ve commented or posted on our clubs pages they ignore me. To test this I did offer to “help” and suddenly I got bombarded with people asking how I was, what I was up too all with the end point of trying to force ideas on what to do on me because they’re too lazy to do it.

I put my all into that club and i feel lonlier then ever as it’s clear they don’t like or value me as a person, just what I can give them.

Edit : looking back on my vent I didn’t really make it clear. I feel lonlier now then I did because while I didn’t make friends at it, I fell a sense of being part of the community. However the attitude of the members have shown me I’m not valued or even recognised unless it benefits them and that’s what’s made me feel lonlier then ever as while I haven’t made friends from it, I’m also not part of that community despite being part of that community!",move current town nmbr friends family area join local sport club try meet people clear sociable bunch start nmbr months hit hard time lazy recruit new people old ones leave bend backwards advertise online put flyers work bring new people moan screw club get thank think would count something long run covid hit shut one person speak since last march even reach people recently contact ask basically dig hole bother rebook usual venue host say rude guess even reply every time ive comment post club page ignore test offer help suddenly get bombard people ask end point try force ideas theyre lazy put club feel lonlier ever clear like value person give edit look back vent really make clear feel lonlier make friends fell sense part community however attitude members show im value even recognise unless benefit thats whats make feel lonlier ever make friends im also part community despite part community

just_some_toast,lonely,1620371078.0,I think I was just born to die alone,"This is the first time I've ever done something like this so forgive me if it's all over the place and messy.

Ever since I can remember I've always been invisible to everyone around me. I was always the last one to be picked in gym class and the last person to be picked for any group assignments. I was never invited to birthday parties, or sleep overs, or to just hang out because I was never anyone's friend. Needless to say that I never went to Homecoming or Prom because I've never had a girlfriend either. Sure I had some ""friends"" back in highschool, but I always felt in the back of my mind that they didn’t really think of me as a friend. They never invited me to hang out or were always ""busy"" when I invited them. And sure enough, right after graduation every single one of them just stopped talking to me. Now I'm 20 years old and have no one. I'm not saying it's everyone else's fault, because I know it's not. I know I wasn't the most social person because of my social anxiety, and my depression probably made me seem off-putting as well, but I always tried my damn hardest to talk to people and try to make friends. It just wasn't enough I guess, or maybe I wasn't, I don't know. All I know is that I'm a 20 year-old, friendless, unemployed, college flunky, who has never even been kissed by a girl before, and by the looks of it, that's how it's always going to be.

dontcallmelaterlv,lonely,1619826655.0,"The loneliness of Regret, then came covid","I am a 45 year old single male living in Las Vegas Nevada. I am originally from Southern New Jersey and I've been living here in Las Vegas for about 16 years.

I was married in 2001. My marriage ended in 2012 and I live with the regret from a decision that I made that led to the ending of our marriage. Allow me to explain.

In 2011 I took a acoustic guitar and started writing songs. By 2012 I started performing these songs live. At the time we were living in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. My songs are unique and mediately catchy to anybody that listen to them. So as I quickly gained popularity in Philadelphia I figured why not move to Las Vegas where we lived prior. Add a marketing background and a keen sense of branding and I figured my music mixed with those skills would take off here. So we made plans and in August of 2012 I made my way to Las Vegas for a second time. My then-wife was supposed to follow two months later.

While I was here in Las Vegas making preparations for her to move here. She got it in her head and made the decision that she didn't want to be with me anymore. And the reason why is because my decision to become a songwriter conflicted with the social construct of living and working and making money. I wanted to follow my dreams and because so, I lost my best friend.

Now although my ex-wife and I still talk, I've been drowning in loneliness ever since this all went down. And for a while, this loneliness even though it was depressing, it kept that a pretty standard level of depressing. But the coronavirus pandemic put things in a tighter crunch. The stress created from me losing my job here and dealing with an appointment system and all this other stuff put a strain on our relationship and now I feel completely disconnected from her and it's heartbreaking.

Now I feel lonely like I've never felt before. My depression has sunk to new lows. My anxiety is through the roof. And I'm scared to grow older. I miss my ex-wife the more importantly I missed the many years we shared together in terms of a comfort zone. I have dated since the dissolve of our marriage but none of it was ever the same. As a matter of fact I've had two relationships here that were extremely abusive and now I deal with post-traumatic issues. My ex-wife is well aware of these circumstances. But she wants to live her life and I don't want to stop her from living her life. But it's the equivalent of me on a ship with no engine stranded at Sea just drifting away and I see her getting smaller and smaller. And it brings tears to my eyes and makes my heart sink to the floor.

You see, on my birthday in 2012 I expected a phone call from her wishing me as such, a happy birthday but instead after not receiving a call from her until late in the night, she told me she did not love me anymore. I was crushed. As I stated above, I've been in a drowning state of loneliness ever since. And the Waters of loneliness are getting to reach my breathing capacity. And I fear that I might take my own life in the future.

As I get older I Lose Friends, Stress and Anxiety and post-traumatic situations further isolate me from everyone, you throw in the coronavirus send you have a mixture of misery. I just want love from someone. It's not that I want to be with my ex-wife anymore, I still want her friendship and I will always love her, I'm very sad that our marriage has dissolved I never in my early years expected or wanted any of this. I currently see a therapist for depression and anxiety issues oh, and I also see a doctor because I have a thyroid issue now from years of stress.

I'm sorry I'm rambling but basically what I'm trying to get at is, I am so lonely. And there are times when that loneliness makes me feel so sick. I have no friends anymore. My family doesn't understand anything I do. And I barely talk to my ex-wife anymore. I don't want to be like this. I just want to go back to the way it was.

Mr_Anonymous2772,lonely,1619994314.0,I am getting increasingly lonely and paranoid.,"Hello everyone. For the first time in a while this pandemic is beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I am just about the only person in my school year who seems to take the threat of COVID somewhat seriously and therefore I do not attend social gatherings etc. School has only just restarted, but I find it difficult to have the same connections with people. Going on PS4 with my friends was something that kept me in contact with my friends and maintained relationships. We started a Minecraft world (I am 17M btw) on which neatly every night in early 2021 we would work on, and it was great. We kept on doing this until one of my closer friends (Bryan •fake name but just for reference) got a PS4 and joined us. He started getting closer to others in the friend group, and I realize that an inner circle begins to form with him and two others. I am not part of this as I am very occupied with chores and schoolwork. Soon enough, Bryan's girlfriend gets Xbox too, and a larger inner circle is formed. When I went on at night after a long day, I would really enjoy myself until we all went offline. Or so I thought. With little effort to hide it, the ""inner circle"" goes back online immediately afterwards, and does not invite me. I no longer go on ps4 to socialize as no matter how much fun I can have, I feel absolutely crushed when this sort of thing happens. So this group goes on every night playing and bonding together into the late hours, and on one occasion a group of friends that I had gone out with last year to drink and fuck around with all met up without me to celebrate getting into university etc (They are aware I'm also going to university). This just really upsets me, as even though I wouldn't have attended due to COVID restrictions, I would have really liked to have an invite. They were, and still unaware of how careful I am regarding covid. And then later on Bryan and three others go out together and don't invite me. It hurts a lot. It really does. Now I find it hard to enjoy my free time as when my friends don't reply to me for more than 30 minutes I begin wondering whether they are out together or on PS4 together. Recently, Bryan goes out with one of the group to go to town. I don't know what I have done wrong but I am progressively getting more and more paranoid I will be left excluded and replaced from a social life I once had. I am worried I will spend my summer holidays left out of all activities. 

Maybe I just need to accept that I am not as close to a group of friends as previously thought? Bottom line is, I feel like I am losing my closest friend and being replaced in my friend group.

Fun thing, I had my 18th birthday party together with him and another guy. We all invited the same number of people, but no one came to celebrate my birthday. So I sat in a dark corner, drinking beer alone for six hours straight. I have no grudge though, actually I'm glad they enjoyed it so it wasn't a complete failure. Still, then I realized how bad the situation was.

I once had a girlfriend. That is, until I found out she's been cheating on me. After she dumped me(!), she would keep sending me vids I don't want to remember - every other day.  
(Edit: she left the country, we're no longer in touch for few years already)

I don't trust my own shadow now and my self-esteem doesn't exist. I'm probably socially disabled now.

Every day I wake up and check my phone just to read some covid headlines, work 8 hours from home office and then stare at empty walls till I fall asleep at 3 AM.

Maybe I should have got used to it already, yet the awareness that no one's there to even find me dead in my home is devastating, lol. I think I won't escape this.

Anyways, last night i texted my old friend that i havent spoken to in 4 years. i told her that i was sorry and how i regret losing her and that i missed her. she accepted my apology and just told me not to worry about it and how she is or was never mad at me for it. we talked for a bit, we didnt really catch up on eachother. in conclusion i basically apologized and she didnt care and moved on. i told her ""goodnight"" and that was it. i was really hoping we couldve restarted and be friends again. it sucks it sucks.

fishboy1999,lonely,1620135981.0,A wonderful dream,"Last night i had the most wonderful dream. I dreamt that my life had not fallen apart, that everything went the way i had planed and that i was happy. None of the tragedies that ruined my family's lives happened and as a result i was able to go to college like i had planed. I still had depression but i was happy with life. But the best part, i wasnt lonely. I had a girlfriend that loved me and i loved her and we were so happy. My life was perfect. But even though i was dreaming a part of me knew it was just a dream. I knew that when i woke i would be miserable, i knew this wonderful dream would become a nightmare. I hope someday that i will be lucky enough to make that dream a reality at least in part. There is someone special to me but i dont know that i will be able to make them mine.",last night wonderful dream dream life fall apart everything go way plan happy none tragedies ruin family live happen result able go college like plan still depression happy life best part lonely girlfriend love love happy life perfect even though dream part know dream know wake would miserable know wonderful dream would become nightmare hope someday lucky enough make dream reality least part someone special know able make mine
anon9677,lonely,1620200977.0,missing the old days,"years ago I used to go out often to explore the city and walk a lot
there was one park that I loved. It was calm and relaxing with a pretty view

I also liked to eat sushi in a place near that park that had the best sushi I've ever eaten

it was nice walking all those miles and being far from home all day

I'm sure it would've been better if I was on all those places with someone else though

that sushi would've been better if I had share it with someone and that park had great spots to sit down and eat ice cream while chatting but I certainly was doing something wrong because I never got to meet anyone and make a friend like they always say ""just go outside and talk to people""

I know there's something wrong with me and I wish I was normal",years ago use go often explore city walk lotthere one park love calm relax pretty viewi also like eat sushi place near park best sushi ever eatenit nice walk miles far home dayi sure would better place someone else thoughthat sushi would better share someone park great spot sit eat ice cream chat certainly something wrong never get meet anyone make friend like always say go outside talk people know something wrong wish normal
